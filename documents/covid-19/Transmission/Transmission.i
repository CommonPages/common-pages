  head = Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns comes from a wealth of case reports, but few studies have described transmission comprehensively. Nevertheless, reports have confirmed transmission in a wide variety of modes and settings. The primary mode of transmission has been disputed, and there are open questions about risk in many settings.

  # head = Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns comes from a wealth of individual case reports, but few reports have described transmission comprehensively. Nevertheless, case reports confirm the transmission of the virus in a wide variety of modes and settings. Relative risk among scenarios remains an active research question. (DP) nCoV-2 is a highly contagious virus and primarily transmits through respiratory droplets (and feces to some extent) shed by patients. A combination of multiple factors makes each of us vulnerable in most common settings of daily interactions. The disease has spread to a global scale rapidly making it a pandemic.

    Though human-human transmission was initially denied, rapid spread of the disease started around late January in 2020 across the world. Since then, there emerged numerous reports on nCoV-2 spreading through multiple modes in many common settings transmitting COVID-19 in communities. An interplay of multiple factors determines the transmission of the virus. We begin with identifying the possible modes/ routes of transmission.

    Given the above modes of transmission, the virus could spread widely in most common settings and conditions of our daily interactions ending up as a pandemic.
