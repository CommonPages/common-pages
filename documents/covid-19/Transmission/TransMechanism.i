  subject Superspreaders

      Subsequent research also shows evidence of 20/80 rule of transmission. Model studies have emphasized to include to transmission heterogeneity to accurately portray pathogen dynamics.

  subject Ro
    head = Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID-19 (the R0) have varied widely. The WHO's initial estimates of the R0 were 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however a more recent review found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79.

      Dispersion factor k number indicates how often an illness occurs and where potential clusters appear. As with the rate of R, it's better to have a low value for k. That would indicate that the potential for distribution is small and the infection can be traced back to a few people or even a single person. But scientists have yet to work out the dispersion factor k for the novel coronavirus.
