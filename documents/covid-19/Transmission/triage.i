  # Animal Transmission
  >
    Animals could play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 disease transmission.

    The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear whether infected dogs can transmit the virus to other animals or back to humans.

    Pigs are unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2.

    Efficient transmission between ferrets has been shown in experimental infections, with spread to naive animals through direct contact but also through indirect airborne spread

  # MINKS

  >
    Minks are the first animal species for which SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been reported.It was first diagnosed on two mink farms in the Netherlands. Sequence analysis of mink-derived viruses pointed at humans as the probable source of the initial infection and demonstrated transmission between minks.

    Recent studies on outbreaks in Denmark provide evidence of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms. Genomic analysis have revealed that the virus had accumulated mutations.

    Preliminary analyses suggested that SARS-CoV-2 isolated from mink in Denmark was less easily neutralised by antibodies in two of nine humans that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 without the mutations

  > CLAIM FOR REPORTS FOR SETTINGS
    During several outbreaks in churches, nursing homes, call centers, cruise-ships and restaurants a potential role for SARS-CoV-2 transmission route remains inconclusive.
