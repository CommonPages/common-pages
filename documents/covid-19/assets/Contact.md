lead: Claimspace COVID-19 is shepherded by a small group of committed sense-makers, but we're looking to scale our community. We have a handful of social media accounts which we'll use to broadcast updates.

We are not yet active on social media, but you can follow [@ClaimspaceOrg](https://twitter.com/ClaimspaceOrg) on Twitter, like the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ClaimspaceOrg) or join the [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/claimspace/) to receive updates once we're active.


To contact the document shepherds, email <a href="mailto:covid-19@claimspace.org">covid-19@claimspace.org</a> directly. We also work in a community slack. Complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P6gsQ7uGlh1_g3J6rDG0Kw-u1dTAc3QJCREten0roZ4/edit) to receive an invitation.
