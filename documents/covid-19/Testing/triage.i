  # Subject Rapid Antigen Testing

  # Background - Test performance
  >  Sensitivity and Specificity for Rapid Antigen Test
    Sensitivity is the percentage of cases positive by a NAAT reference standard that are detected as positive by the Ag-RDT under evaluation.
    Specificity is the percentage of cases negative by a NAAT reference standard that are detected as negative by the Ag-RDT under evaluation. The prevalence of disease in the community being tested strongly affects the predictive value of a positive or negative result . Thus, the clinical value of a positive or negative test result will depend on what action is taken on the basis of the test result when interpreted in the context of local prevalence. negative and positive Predictive value

  # Background
  > Postive and Negative Predictive Value
    The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) are the proportions of positive and negative results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true positive and true negative results, respectively. The PPV and NPV describe the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic.

  # Important Recommendation but for decision makers
  > Recommendation - Can be rephrased as a claim.
    Use of Ag-RDTs is not recommended in settings or populations with low expected prevalence of disease (e.g. screening at points of entry, blood donation, elective surgery), especially where confirmatory testing by NAAT is not readily available.

  #  > Claim and Find paper for this
  #    False- positive (indicating that a person is infected when they are not) results may occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, such other human coronaviruses.

  # Subject discharge and discountine isolation
  >
    Based on the present findings, early discharge with ensuing home isolation could be chosen for patients who are beyond day 10 of symptoms with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies per ml of sputum. Both criteria predict that there is little residual risk of infectivity, based on cell culture.

  # Subject Testing

  > Background
    Viral tests identify the virus in samples from your respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose. Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
