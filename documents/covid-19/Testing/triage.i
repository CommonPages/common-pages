  # Subject Rapid Antigen Testing

  # Background - Test performance
  >  Sensitivity and Specificity for Rapid Antigen Test
    Sensitivity is the percentage of cases positive by a NAAT reference standard that are detected as positive by the Ag-RDT under evaluation.
    Specificity is the percentage of cases negative by a NAAT reference standard that are detected as negative by the Ag-RDT under evaluation. The prevalence of disease in the community being tested strongly affects the predictive value of a positive or negative result . Thus, the clinical value of a positive or negative test result will depend on what action is taken on the basis of the test result when interpreted in the context of local prevalence. negative and positive Predictive value

  # Background
  > Postive and Negative Predictive Value
    The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) are the proportions of positive and negative results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true positive and true negative results, respectively. The PPV and NPV describe the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic.

  # Background
  > Antigen Test
    Antigen Test detect the presence of viral proteins in a biological sample, such as saliva or tissue swabbed from the nasal cavity. Antigen tests are typically cheap, return results in minutes, and, like the genetic tests, reveal an active infection. They already exist for strep throat, influenza, tuberculosis, HIV, and other infectious diseases.

  # Background
  > Rapid Antigen Test for Covid
    Rapid diagnostic tests that detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins (antigens) in respiratory tract specimens are being developed and commercialized. Most of these are lateral flow immunoassays (LFI), which are typically completed within 30 minutes. In contrast to NAATs, there is no amplification of the target that is detected, making antigen tests less sensitive. Additionally, false- positive (indicating that a person is infected when they are not) results may occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, such other human coronaviruses.

  # Important Recommendation but for decision makers
  > Recommendation - Can be rephrased as a claim.
    Use of Ag-RDTs is not recommended in settings or populations with low expected prevalence of disease (e.g. screening at points of entry, blood donation, elective surgery), especially where confirmatory testing by NAAT is not readily available.

  > Claim
    The sensitivity of different RDTs compared to rRT-PCR in specimens from URT (nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs) appears to be highly variable, but specificity is consistently reported to be high.

  > Claim
    RAD test serves only as adjunct to RT-PCR test because of low sensitivity (potential for false-negative results.)

  # This claim needs to be merged with viral load claim of timing
  > Claim
    Ag-RDTs are most likely to perform well in patients with high viral loads which usually appear in the pre-symptomatic (1-3 days before symptom onset) and early symptomatic phases of the illness (within the first 5-7 days of illness)

  #  > Claim and Find paper for this
  #    False- positive (indicating that a person is infected when they are not) results may occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, such other human coronaviruses.

  # Subject discharge and discountine isolation
  >
    Based on the present findings, early discharge with ensuing home isolation could be chosen for patients who are beyond day 10 of symptoms with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies per ml of sputum. Both criteria predict that there is little residual risk of infectivity, based on cell culture.

  > Claim
    Patients with high Ct value (* above 33–34 - Absolute number as some recommend above 37) in RT-PCR system are not contagious and thus can be discharged from hospital care or strict confinement for non-hospitalized patients.

    The distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemic’s trajectory

  # Subject Testing

  > Background
    Viral tests identify the virus in samples from your respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose. Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
