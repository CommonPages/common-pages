  # Subject Cross Immunity
  > Claim
    SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies are non-neutralizing and do not meaningfully protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection or reduce COVID-19 severity.

  # Subject protective Immunity
  > Claim
    There is evidence to suggest that prior infection with a coronavirus, including  SARS-CoV-2, confers some level of immunity and protection against reinfection with the  same viral species. However,the extent and duration of this protection is unknown.

  # More than 90% of seroconverters make detectible neutralizing antibody responses for a long duration

  ##### Neutralising Antibody
  # (We will have more claims under RBD-specific antibodies and anti-S igm/igg which will be linked with vaccines)
  > Claim
    RBD-specific antibodies have greater potency to neutralize infection with divergent virus strains, suggesting that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can also serve as an important target for the development of potent and specific nAbs.

    The mean time SARS-CoV-2 takes to develop symptoms (incubation period) is 5-6 days, with a range of between 1 and 14 days following exposure.

    There is an association between the severity of an infectious disease and the length of incubation period- covid 19. Patients with a shorter incubation period went on to have more severe disease.

    More importantly, incubation period is the interaction of pathogen and host immunity. The length of incubation period is closely linked to immunological state.

  > Claim
    Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic people will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve.

  # Can redo the existing claim of children vs adult in antibody response
  > Claim
    Study showing #SARSCoV2 antibody response differs between children & adults. Children generate more antibodies for spike (S), than nucleocapsid (N) protein.
