  ##### Neutralising Antibody
  # (We will have more claims under RBD-specific antibodies and anti-S igm/igg which will be linked with vaccines)
  > Claim
    RBD-specific antibodies have greater potency to neutralize infection with divergent virus strains, suggesting that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can also serve as an important target for the development of potent and specific nAbs.

  > Claim
    Stable adaptive Immune Response for 90% patient for over 6 months. However response is heterogenous which means some proportion of population will always be prone to reinfection

  # Interesting Stat - Overall 20% of cases are asymptotic - can go on Asymtomatic Phase   
  >
    The summary proportion of SARS-CoV-2 that is asymptomatic throughout the course of infection was estimated, across all study settings, to be 20%.
