lead: Common COVID-19 is shepherded by a small group of committed sense-makers, but we're looking to scale our community. We have a handful of social media accounts which we'll use to broadcast updates.

We are not very active on social media, but you can follow [@CommonPages](https://twitter.com/CommonPages) on Twitter to receive updates once we're active.

To contact the page shepherds, email <a href="mailto:covid-19@common.page">covid-19@common.page</a> directly. We also work in a community slack. Complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KGDbzM2hxOyQzU81kth5n5RiGzxDzlgHTdg2bOY6Azs/edit) to receive an invitation.
