title: How to Contribute to Common COVID-19
lead: Anyone can contribute. For now, all proposed revisions pass through a small group of page shepherds, though we hope to scale this over time.

The seed version of the page was released on {Revisions.November_21 November 21, 2020}, so there's lots of room for improvement.

Links throughout the page point to Google Forms which all community contributions currently pass through. We'll streamline the process over time. Anonymous feedback will be reviewed but obviously if we can't communicate with you there's a chance we won't be able to incorporate your feedback. We're also keeping track of contributions and backfill attributions unless you'd like to opt out.

### Answer Questions

Each question contains a response link which loads the appropriate Google Form:

Responses will be collected under the question until there's enough material to split the references into claims. You can help by providing as much structure as you can, as detailed in the page's instructions.
