    Does your vaccine cause infertility? What can you share about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women?
    Are COVID-19 Vaccines Going To Cause Infertility?

    he claim that the vaccines for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 will cause infertility because of some kind of crossreactive immune response between the spike protein antigens and syncytin proteins is baseless

    Someone has claimed that the COVID-19 vaccines are going to cause infertility because of a shared amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a placental protein, which will make the immune system attack both as it can’t tell the difference.Some have argued that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein will cross-react with syncytin proteins because of an underlying sequence homology.


    Some have argued that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein will cross-react with syncytin proteins because of an underlying sequence homology.


    The truth? This sequence is too short for the immune system to meaningfully confuse it with placental proteins. It’s sort of like saying that you are going to be confused with a criminal because you wear a commonly sold red bracelet that was also found on the criminal. It’s not realistic. If this were true, we would also expect COVID-19 to cause early pregnancy loss a significant amount of the time.
    The evidence available to us does not support that this is the case. There is no reasonable basis to believe that vaccines against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 will affect fertility.

    Genetic studies of mice in which syncytins are knocked out (mutations are introduced so that no functional protein is generated) show that syncytins are critical for the formation of a placenta, and in their absence it fails to form.
    In humans, there are two proteins responsible for this: syncytin-1 (present in every layer of the trophoblast, the outer layer of cells in the blastocyst, a very early point in the development of a mammal appearing between days 5 and 9) and syncytin-2 (found in cytotrophoblast cells). The placenta is required for pregnancy, and thus tampering with syncytins can result in infertility.The placenta is a temporary and autonomous organ made by the fetus (not the mother) which helps to establish a blood supply within the wall of the uterus so that the developing human can exchange nutrients and waste with the mother. In addition, the placenta helps to mediate immunological tolerance between the mother and the fetus. Each is not-self compared with the other, so the placenta forms a barrier between the two so that neither’s immune system can respond to the other.
    The placenta has a layer called the syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) which implants into the uterine wall and helps to establish a fetal blood supply, and is in direct contact with the maternal circulation. This is a true syncytium and it has multiple critical supportive functions, including the production of hormones that help to regulate fetal development, the regulation of gas, nutrient, and waste exchange between the fetus and mother, and it serves as a direct barrier against infection. In addition to the SCT, there are so-called giant cells formed from cytotrophoblast that invade into the uterine wall and remodel the vasculature to enhance blood supply to the fetus later in pregnancy. And all this because of a few viruses!

  >
    As we’ve established, the SCT supports the overall structure of the placental villi and has many important roles in supporting a pregnancy. SCT cells do indeed express syncytin-1, and an immune response directed against SCT cells can tragically result in early pregnancy loss. People with certain autoimmune diseases like antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) and systemic lupus erythematosus are (SLE) are at much higher risk for pregnancy loss, which is thought to occur from an inappropriate immune response directed against the trophoblast cells.

  >
    While COVID-19 seems to be a more severe disease in pregnancy, there is no evidence right now of an increase in early pregnancy losses, as might be expected if there were an aberrant immune response directed against placental antigens.

  >
    case reports discussing pregnancy losses in patients with COVID-19, but case reports cannot tell us whether the two events are related, merely that they co-occurred. Though we should not take absence of evidence as evidence of absence, right nowthere isn’t good data to suggest that having COVID-19 significantly raises the risk of spontaneous abortion, suggesting that at a minimum (factoring in how long the pandemic has been going), if such occurrences are related, they are rare.


    There are no data to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine causes infertility. It has been incorrectly suggested that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of a very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is partly shared with a protein in the placenta called syncytin-1. From a scientific perspective, the differences between the two sequences are quite significant, making it very unlikely our vaccine could generate a response that would harm the placenta.

    Until findings are available from clinical trials and additional studies, only limited data are available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, administered during pregnancy:
    Limited data are currently available from animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. No safety concerns were demonstrated in rats that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy; studies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are ongoing.
    Studies in people who are pregnant are planned.
    Both vaccine manufacturers are monitoring people in the clinical trials who became pregnant


    vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mother-to-child or mother-to-fetus appears to be very rare, even though the placenta does express ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and it will be important to continue monitoring patients who acquire the virus via vertical transmission to determine if any anomalies result.

    . If very small homologies exist, they will not be detected by the BLAST algorithm (hence the qualifier in the search output of “significant similarity”). There is a sequence of 5 amino acids (there is a divergence for one of them, or else it would be 6) which is shared between the spike protein and the syncytin-1 protein:


    Lastly, one may wonder, how did this short stretch of amino acids end up in the spike protein? Is it proof that SARS-CoV-2 is a bioweapon? No. Unequivocally, absolutely no. The answer is much more basic than that: evolution. The spike protein evolved to allow SARS-CoV-2 to fuse its membrane with a target cell’s. Syncytins evolved to do the same (but they’re from a different virus). But some sequences will be selected for by evolutionary pressures that enhance transmission. If a particular sequence is selected for because it is good at mediating fusion, this will show up across multiple lifeforms (this is known as convergent evolution). Both syncytin and spike are class I fusion proteins.

    mRNA vaccines do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and, therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell. Cells break down the mRNA quickly. Based on how mRNA vaccines work, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant. However, the actual risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and her fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant women.

    a recent study in JAMA Network Open compared the outcomes of pregnancies in women that have / have not had SARS-CoV-2 infection, which showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

    This seems to be based on perceived similarities between the coronavirus’s spike protein – which is the key part of the virus that the vaccines target – and a protein found in the placenta called syncytin-1. This has led to the unfounded theory that antibodies against the spike protein will attack syncytin-1, stopping it performing its important role in the placenta. This is simply not true. The similarity between the proteins is insufficient for this to be of any concern.

    Evidence shows that the risk of miscarriage is not increased in women who have had a SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. This indicates that even if spike protein antibodies are present within the uterus, they don’t have a negative effect on implantation or early development of the placenta.

    The mother’s blood supply is not fully connected to the placenta until the end of the first trimester. The passage of antibodies from mother to baby across the placenta then follows in the second and third trimesters. This is a normal part of pregnancy and provides protection to the baby against infectious diseases. This is known as passive immunity and continues after the baby is born with antibodies being transferred via breast milk.

    While pregnant women haven’t been recruited into these trials yet, due to these trials’ large size, there have been instances when women involved have become pregnant. In the cases where this has happened, there has been no adverse effect on the pregnancy.

    It has been incorrectly suggested that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of a shared amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a placental protein,” she said in an email. “The sequence, however, is too short to plausibly give rise to autoimmunity. The idea behind this technology is that both of these vaccines contain the sequence of the RNA that encodes for the spike protein of SARS-COV2,” said Matthew Frieman, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.Jacob Yount, an associate professor of the department of microbial infection and immunity at Ohio State University, College of Medicine, has studied the syncytin proteins as well as SARS-CoV-2. Yount said the COVID vaccines do not contain syncytin-1 protein or mRNA encoding syncytin-1, and thus there is no reason to think that an immune response against syncytin-1 would be developed.

  >
    Can your vaccine cause people to develop COVID-19?
    No. Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which does not use the live virus but rather a small portion of the viral sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to instruct the body to produce the spike protein displayed on the surface of the virus. That spike protein then generates an immune response to the virus to potentially prevent infection. The vaccine does not allow the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate and it cannot cause any known illness.[x]

    #
    # A three-year review of adverse reports logged into a U.S. national vaccine database found that anaphylaxis after vaccination is rare, occurring at a rate of about 1.31 per million doses of vaccine administered. Of those cases, 85% were in people with a history of allergies. None of the 33 cases — out of 25 million vaccinations — died. Some needed epinephrine, the drug in EpiPens, but others recovered after treatment with antihistamines.

  >
    Does Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine cause Bell’s palsy?
    Bell’s palsy is a condition that affects the nerves controlling facial muscles and can occur after a viral infection. It is typically temporary and resolves in a few weeks.[xvii] The observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no indication of a causal relationship at this time. Pfizer and BioNTech together with FDA will continue to monitor for cases of Bell’s palsy as the vaccine is given to larger populations.

    Cases of Bell’s palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded these cases were caused by vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Bell’s Palsy may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.


    Bell’s palsy, too, has been linked in at least one circumstance to a vaccine, an intranasally administered flu vaccine that was briefly brought to market in Switzerland.

    Eight people in the Pfizer and Moderna trials, which enrolled nearly 74,000 participants in total, were diagnosed with the condition — seven in the vaccine arms and one in the placebo arm of the Moderna trial. The jury is still out on whether Bell’s palsy, which afflicts about 40,000 people a year in the U.S., is an occasional side effect of taking a Covid-19 vaccine.

    As vaccinations begin on a larger scale, reports of other potential side effects will likely pop up. A few cases of something are anecdotes, not data, and definitely not proof of a causal relationship. While they must and will be studied, investigations of this sort take time.

    The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) has reviewed the data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) related to the recently approved COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that reported four and three cases of facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) respectively in patients who were vaccinated and one patient who received the placebo.
    there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time.
    At this time, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the existence of a causal relationship between vaccination against COVID-19 and Bell's palsy
    The FDA will continue surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations. AAO-HNS feels these rare events should not dissuade healthcare personnel or patients from receiving these critical vaccines.

    # The absence of large numbers of confirmed and published in-flight transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 is encouraging but is not definitive evidence that fliers are safe. The circumstances for robust study have been too few among the disruption of the pandemic to know with precision the risk and factors needed to quantitate transmission under widely varying circumstances. At present, based on circumstantial data, strict use of masks appears to be protective. Structured prospective studies to quantitate transmission risk on flight with rigid masking protocols are now most pressing. At the same time, those with robust data on in-flight transmission in the days prior to on-board masking should come forward and publish these data.

    The absence of large numbers of confirmed and published in-flight transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 is encouraging but is not definitive evidence that fliers are safe.
     The circumstances for robust study have been too few among the disruption of the pandemic to know with precision the risk and factors needed to quantitate transmission under widely varying circumstances. At present, based on circumstantial data, strict use of masks appears to be protective.

    Reports of suspected in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are relatively few, which probably reflects the challenges of establishing in-flight transmission; the fact that flight-associated transmission may be rare; and the fact that as the pandemic progressed, many airlines adopted measures to decrease risk (e.g., reduced food and beverage services, removal of in-flight entertainment, provision of masks and sanitizing wipes, limitation of movement around the cabin, and enhanced cleaning of the airplane)

    With over two billion airline passengers annually, in-flight transmission of infectious diseases is an important global health concern.

    Many instances of in-flight transmission have been documented, but the relative influence of the many factors (see below) affecting in-flight transmission has not been quantified. Long-standing guidance by public health agencies is that the primary transmission risk associated with air travel for most respiratory infectious diseases is associated with sitting within two rows of an infectious passenger. The effect of proximity may be one of these factors.
    Infection at a distance from the index case indicates other factors, such as airflow, movement of passenger/crew members, fomites and contacts between passengers in the departure gate before boarding, or after deplaning, are involved
    Cabin transmission of infectious diseases can occur through several routes.

This transmission zone, which actually comprises 5 rows—2 in front of the index case, 2 behind the index case, and the row in which the index case is seated—has been based on investigations of in-flight transmission of tuberculosis but is believed to have wide applicability1 This rule is empirical and does not directly take into account the physical and biological bases for droplet transmission—that is, ≤1 meter of contact.

    The spatial distribution of secondary cases on this flight suggests that the current public health practice for contact tracing of passengers exposed to SARS-CoV-2 while aboard aircraft may benefit from additional study (18,19).

    Although infrequently reported and very difficult to assess accurately, there is a risk of disease transmission during commercial air travel and this risk has become the focus of heightened attention. The growing mobility of people and popularity of airline transportation has amplified the potential for disease to be transmitted to passengers not only during but also before and after flights.

    The risk of transmission of droplet-mediated infections on an aircraft depends on proximity to an index case and on other factors, such as movement of passengers and crew, fomites, and contact among passengers in the departure gate.


    Second, most of the secondary infections were in persons seated at the window, 2 of whom denied ever leaving their seat during the flight. This finding was unanticipated given the widely held view that persons in window seats are at lower risk for exposure to an infectious pathogen during flight, a belief supported by data simulating transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory illnesses during flights of similar duration on single-aisle airplanes in the United States (20).

    Compelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, especially as source control to prevent spread from infected persons, but also as protection to reduce wearers’ exposure to infection.

    Our data strongly support the notion that cocktail therapy may provide a powerful way to minimize mutational escape by SARS-CoV-2; escape mutants were not generated following treatment with a non-competing antibody cocktail.
    The REN10987+REGN10933 antibody cocktail—which consists of two antibodies that can simultaneously bind to two independent epitopes on the RBD—retained its ability to neutralize all identified mutants, even those that were selected for by single treatment with one of its components.
    As demonstrated with our single-antibody escape studies, even highly potent neutralization does not protect against the rapid generation of viral escape mutants, and escape remains a major concern with individual antibody approaches.

    two papers from South Africa that looked at the impact of the full B.1.351 spike on neutralization and saw a significant reduction in neutralizing activity, although the clinical implication for vaccine efficacy remains to be determined.

    Researchers in South Africa, meanwhile, have found that antibodies from six recovered patients were six to 200 times less effective at neutralizing B.1.351.

    The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies.

    The recent emergence of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.28 is a clear demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift. This conclusion is supported by data presented herein, illustrating how so many of these spike changes conferred resistance from antibody neutralization.


    Mutationally, this virus is traveling in a direction that could ultimately lead to escape from our current therapeutic and prophylactic interventions directed to the viral spike. If the rampant spread of the virus continues and more critical mutations accumulate, then we may be condemned to chasing after the evolving SARS-CoV-2 continually, as we have long done for influenza virus

    Vaccines such as the Oxford/Astra Zeneca ChAdOx1 and the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 [24] elicit neutralization titers in a similar range to the convalescent plasma in this study. However, these vaccines may elicit a broader antibody response and protective T cell immunity. Protective T cell immunity also likely occurs following natural infection. Further more, it is unclear what degree of neutralization mediates protection, and infection may be particularly sensitive to inhibition at exposure.

Preclinical in vivo tests with the vaccine in mice are reported in mBio, and demonstrated that just one, relatively low dose of the vaccine given to animals intranasally fully protected all the treated mice from a lethal dose of MERS coronavirus, and improved virus clearance in the lungs.

  # There is limited experience with use of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.

  # Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.

  # The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in children under 16 years of age have not yet been established

  # Contraindications
  # Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis: Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.

  # General recommendations: The administration of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness. Individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with a bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, should not be given the vaccine unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the vaccine. No data are available about concomitant use of immunosuppressants. As with any vaccine, vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 may not protect all vaccine recipients. No data are available on the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in persons

  # 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation: Pregnancy: There is limited experience with use of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. Fertility: Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity
  # Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on a conventional study of repeat dose toxicity. Reproductive toxicity:Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered with the COVID19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No data on the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

    The vaccine works by instructing our bodies to make antibodies that bind to a viral protein called Spike. This stops the virus from infecting our cells. The claim that the vaccine might reduce fertility came from the idea that there are proteins in the placenta that have some similarities with Spike, so the antibodies that block Spike might also attach to the placenta. But the viral and placental proteins are not similar enough that we would expect this to happen. If antibodies against Spike did cause problems for the placenta, we would expect to see miscarriages in pregnant people who become infected with COVID19, and we don’t see this.

    SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, with new lineages being
    reported all over the world. Amongst previous lineages, D614G was shown to have faster growth in vitro,
    enhanced transmission in small animals, and has subsequently become globally dominant.

  >
    N501Y has been shown to increase affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which together with the repeated and independent evolution of 501Y containing lineages25,26,31, strongly argues for enhanced transmissibility of these new variants.

  >
    This suggests that, despite the many people who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 globally and are presumed to have accumulated some level of immunity, new variants such as 501Y.V2 pose a significant re-infection risk.

    Neutralizing antibodies have repeatedly been demonstrated as the primary correlate of protection for most vaccines, including those designed to prevent infection with respiratory pathogens34

  # Questions for VACCINES
  # If a person has a reaction to one SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, what are the implications for the safety of vaccination with a different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? Furthermore, what safety issues may preclude future vaccination altogether?
  # What are the correlates of protective immunity after natural infection or vaccination? How long will immunity last? Will widespread immunity limit the spread of the virus in the population? Which component of the vaccine is responsible for allergic reactions? Are some vaccines less likely than others to cause IgE- and non-IgE–mediated reactions?
  # So why did Europe and the US both choose mRNA vaccines (never before tested for coronaviruses in humans) and not WKV (proven efficacy for antibody production against coronavirus in humans)?
  # "Would Salk-style inactivated or whole killed virus vaccine (WKV) be worth considering as well? Its distribution and storage should be easier than a mRNA vaccine..."
  # is the vaccine still effective if the virus mutates?
  # will the fda authorised vaccines work against the new variant?
  # Why do we need a booster shots? This is because B cell responses induced by first dose only generates lower levels, lower affinity and short lived antibody responses. The booster dose(s) allow stimulation of robust long-lasting immunity with high affinity/neutralizing Ab
  # So how effective is a single dose vaccine? We do not know for sure, but for at least a month or more, a single shot mRNA vaccines should provide ~90% protection (>14 d post vaccination). This is from the Moderna VRBPAC Briefing Document. (6/n)

  # why Australia isn't just rolling out the vaccine prior to regulatory approval, or why the TGA just doesn't register the vaccine based on approvals in other countries.https://twitter.com/peripatetical/status/1346036208116269059

  # I've previously discussed some of the issues of interest when considering how effective the vaccine is. The primary question is whether the vaccine prevents disease.
  # Several other questions are very important to the COVID vaccine program - the degree to which vaccines prevent transmission, and whether they work in high risk subgroups (esp older people)
  #
  # Safety requires larger numbers of participants in trials. What we're looking for is a "safety signal" - anything that might hint that something serious might be caused by a vaccine, and how common it is.
  #
  # t is worth noting that many diseases have a "background rate" - for example flu-like illnesses occur quite commonly in both groups. In the Pfizer study, a third of participants in the placebo arm had fatigue or headache.
  #
  # That's not all - there are questions about toxicology of the vaccine or its components (such as the lipid layer used in mRNA vaccines, or adjuvants used in protein vaccines).
  #
  # We want to know that there is the correct amount of vaccine in each dose. We want to know they are free from contamination. That there are no differences between different batches or those made in different factories. We need to know the shelf life under different conditions.
  #
  # Whether they can be used safely in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Whether they can be given with other vaccines such as the flu vaccine.
  #
  # Can anyone think of a time a vaccine has been rolled out to a RNA virus (or any other pathogen) at the same time so much infection is happening ... I’m not sure we understand the consequences at all of suboptimal immunity.
  #
  # There are so many unknowns relating to introducing a vaccine when attack rates are so high. Delaying a boost to maximise protective immunity appears to add yet more unknowns.


  # questions #variants

  # New Variants- How will it affect vaccines under development?
  # Did the variant achieve prominence through natural selection or chance events? If the evidence suggests natural selection, which mutation(s) are being selected? What is the adaptive benefit of these mutations? What effect do these mutations have on transmissibility and spread, antigenicity, or virulence?

  # Are the symptoms of #COVID19 different in children? Do the new variants impact children differently? What can parents do to keep children safe from COVID-19

  # flights

  # When a positive COVID-19 case is linked to a flight, rapid flight contact tracing may prevent onward spread and we support the proposed EU digitalised public health passenger locator form [12] and development of improved systems of tracing. (ii) Swift action is needed where cases with no other link emerge beyond the close contact two-seat radius [1] to instigate early investigation and control measures.

  # CONTEXT - NOT SURE IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS

  >

    The preliminary analysis of wastewater samples collected between July and December 2020 in Switzerland has identified several of the signature mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineage in several of the samples.

    Denmark is one of the largest mink fur producers in the world. On 17 June 2020, Danish authorities reported the first identification of SARS-CoV-2 in mink at a farm in the North Jutland Region. Since early-August 2020, large SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreaks have been reported in mink farms in Denmark. Despite intensive efforts to contain the outbreaks, as of 8 November 2020 the virus had been detected in 229 (20%) of the 1 140 mink farms in the country. Affected farms are located in northern, central and western Jutland regions. In the majority of the infected farms, the PCR and sero-prevalence in mink were close to 100% by the time the outbreak was detected. Links between human cases and mink outbreaks were found, although it was often not possible to determine whether mink or humans were infected first.

  >
    To contain the spread of mink farm outbreaks, a range of measures have been implemented at various stages during the epidemic. Measures include the culling of infected mink, enhanced surveillance of the local human population, including population-wide mass RT-PCR testing in the North Jutland Region, movement restrictions in the affected areas, limited access to the farms (for employees only), and application of strict hygiene routines - e.g. hand washing and changing clothes before and after entering farms. Local restrictions, including restricted movement of people between municipalities, have been implemented for the period 9 November 2020 to 3 December 2020 in the North Jutland Region. Since 4 November 2020, the government of Denmark has been discussing a cull of all mink in the country.

  # Antigenicity and Vaccine Effectiveness

  >
    many mutations in spike might affect neutralization by convalescent sera.
    Sometimes a mutation that enhances one viral property, such as binding to a receptor, can reduce another property, such as escaping host antibody. Indeed, recent evidence suggests this could be the case for D614G.10 It is possible that mutations in spike that are “good” for the virus right now could also make it less fit in the context of population-level immunity in the future.

  >
    Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants has largely focused on mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which mediates attachment to cells and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. There is intense interest in whether mutations in the spike glycoprotein mediate escape from host antibodies and could potentially compromise vaccine effectiveness, since spike is the major viral antigen in the current vaccines.

  >
    If SARS-CoV-2 transmission among mink affects a very large number of animals and/or is sustained over long periods of time, there is a risk that variants with significantly different antigenic properties or variants causing increased severity of disease could eventually emerge. The likelihood of this risk and the consequences are unclear, but such a scenario should be taken into consideration.

    Discussion - CONTEXT FOR GENERAL VACCINES
    The mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe and effective and being deployed globally to
    prevent infection and disease. The vaccines elicit antibody responses against the RBD, the major
    target of neutralizing antibodies 30-35 194 , in a manner that resembles natural infection. Notably, the
    neutralizing antibodies produced by mRNA vaccination target the same epitopes as natural infection. The data is consistent with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers translated from the injected RNA adopting the range of conformations available to spikes on the surfaces of virions. Moreover, different individuals immunized with either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer199 BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines produce closely related and nearly identical antibodies. belonging to 4 different classes based on their target regions on the RBD20 202 . Class 1 and 2 antibodies are among the most potent and also the most abundant antibodies6,7,30,31,34 203 . These antibodies target epitopes that overlap or are closely associated with RBD residues K417, E484 and N501. They are frequently sensitive to mutation in these residues and select for K417N, E484K and N501Y mutations in both yeast and VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins10,13,24. To avert selection and escape, antibody therapies should be composed of combinations of antibodies that target non-overlapping epitopes7,10,11,24,36-38 208 .

    Evidence of in-flight transmission on a flight

  >
    A small number of published reports in this area.Reports
    Similar reports of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted during flight have recently been published (3,4,16,17).
    Those reports, along with the findings we report, demonstrate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread on long-haul flights. This outbreak demonstrates the potential for spread of SARS-CoV-2 linked to air travel.

    These transmission events occurred despite reported in-flight use of masks and gloves.It is interesting that four of the flight cases were not seated next to any other positive case, had no contact in the transit lounge, wore face masks in-flight and would not be deemed close contacts under current guidance from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

    Reports of suspected in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are relatively few, which probably reflects the challenges of establishing in-flight transmission; the fact that flight-associated transmission may be rare; and the fact that as the pandemic progressed, many airlines adopted measures to decrease risk.

    The extent to which pregnant women might represent a ‘sentinel group’, providing an accessible snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the general population.
    Mapping the exposure of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 infection is important, as they represent a potentially vulnerable group [17,18]; more evidence is required to determine whether pregnancy is a risk factor either for acquisition of infection or for severe maternal disease [19,20], and to identify adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes.

  # Having tested that the virus construct expressed S protein when used to infect lab-grown cells, the researchers carried out in vivo experiments with the PIV-5-MERS-S vaccine in mice engineered to carry the human DPP4 receptor. They found that all the animals given a single intranasal dose were protected against a lethal challenge with MERS-CoV, whereas all the control animals died following viral challenge.The finding that PIV5 expressing MERS S protected mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge at a single low dose of 104 PFU suggests its potential use as a vaccine vector for emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2,” the team concluded. “Further studies of using PIV5 expressing the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate are ongoing.”

  # The researchers noted several factors that make PIV5 expressing a coronavirus spike protein an appealing platform for vaccine development against emerging coronaviruses. PIV5 can infect many different mammals, including humans, without causing disease, and is also being investigated as a vaccine vector for other respiratory diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. The fact that a low dose of the vaccine was sufficient to protect the mice might be beneficial with a view to creating enough vaccine for mass immunization. The MERS vaccine in the reported current study was, in addition, the most effective MERS vaccine to date in animal models of the disease.

  # Developers of protein vaccines must develop their own version of the spike protein—one that closely mimics the naturally occurring spike and is stable enough to retain its immunological punch during manufacturing, packaging, and distribution. Most such vaccines include an additional compound called an adjuvant to help stimulate a strong, protective immune response. Those extra steps make protein vaccines slower to develop than those that deliver genetic instructions.

  #    pregnancy
  # Replication-defective adenoviruses, when chemically attenuated, are ideal vectors because of their ability to accommodate large transgenes and encode proteins without viral integration into the host cell genome.

  #   The immunity paradox during pregnancy that favours tolerance to the fetus (ie, stops the maternal immune system from rejecting the fetus), but leaves the mother susceptible to viral infections, can be opportunistically leveraged by simian adenoviral vectors. The ChAdOx1 vaccine platform is non-replicating and could be used to deliver proteins to the mother for the induction of an immune response without adversely affecting the fetus. Transplacental transfer of maternal induced antibodies can ensue, but without transfer of the virus vector to the fetus. Unfortunately, pregnant women have historically been excluded from pharmaceutical research, owing to well intentioned, but sometimes misguided, concerns about fetal safety.

  # AstraZeneca has manufactured a vaccine using a viral-vector demonstrating early efficacy as well and this next generation platform has previously been utilized with the Ebola vaccine and safely administered during pregnancy with an acceptable safety profile

    According to the current CDC recommendations, all persons with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to any component of the mRNA SARS-Cov-2 vaccines should avoid these vaccines, and this recommendation would currently exclude patients with a history of immediate reactions associated with PEG. It would also currently exclude patients with a history of anaphylaxis after receiving either the BioNTech–Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine, who should avoid all PEG 2000–formulated mRNA vaccines, and all PEG and injectable polysorbate 80 products, until further investigations are performed and more information is available.


    In response to the two cases of anaphylaxis in the United Kingdom, the MHRA issued a pause on vaccination with the Pfizer–BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, to exclude any person with a history of anaphylactic reaction to any food, drug, or vaccine.

  >
    The mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer–BioNtech and Moderna use a lipid-based nanoparticle carrier system that prevents the rapid enzymatic degradation of mRNA and facilitates in vivo delivery. This lipid-based nanoparticle carrier system is further stabilized by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000 lipid conjugate that provides a hydrophilic layer, prolonging half-life.

    We can be reassured that vaccine-associated anaphylaxis has been a rare event, at one case per million injections, for most known vaccines. Acute allergic reactions after vaccination might be caused by the vaccine antigen, residual nonhuman protein, or preservatives and stabilizers in the vaccine formulation, also known as excipients. Although local reactions may be commonly associated with the active antigen in the vaccine, IgE-mediated reactions or anaphylaxis have historically been more typically associated with the inactive components or products of the vaccine manufacturing process, such as egg, gelatin, or latex.

    PEG is a compound used as an excipient in medications and has been implicated as a rare, “hidden danger” cause of IgE-mediated reactions and recurrent anaphylaxis.9 The presence of lipid PEG 2000 in the mRNA vaccines has led to concern about the possibility that this component could be implicated in anaphylaxis. To date, no other vaccine that has PEG as an excipient has been in widespread use

  #   In the phase 1–3 clinical trials of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, potential participants with a history of an allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine were excluded. The Pfizer–BioNTech studies also excluded participants with a history of severe allergy associated with any vaccine.On December 11, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA vaccine, and general vaccination of health care workers was started on Monday, December 14. On December 15, a 32-year-old female health care worker in Alaska who had no known allergies presented with an anaphylactic reaction within 10 minutes after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The participants who had these initial three reported cases of anaphylaxis would not have been excluded on the basis of their histories from the mRNA vaccine clinical trials.1,2 Since the index case in Alaska, several more cases of anaphylaxis associated with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine have been reported in the United States after vaccination of almost 2 million health care workers, and the incidence of anaphylaxis associated with the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine appears to be approximately 10 times as high as the incidence reported with all previous vaccines, at approximately 1 in 100,000, as compared 1 in 1,000,000, the known and stable incidence of anaphylaxis associated with other vaccines.The EUA for the Moderna mRNA vaccine was issued on December 18, and it is currently too soon to know whether a similar signal for anaphylaxis will be associated with that vaccine; however, at this time a small number of potential cases of anaphylaxis have been reported, including one case on December 24 in Boston in a health care worker with shellfish allergy who was carrying auto-injectable epinephrine.




  # Severe allergy-like reactions in at least eight people who received the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech over the past 2 weeks may be due to a compound in the packaging of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that forms the vaccine’s main ingredient, scientists say. A similar mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna, which was authorized for emergency use in the United States on Friday, also contains the compound, polyethylene glycol (PEG).

  # PEG has never been used before in an approved vaccine, but it is found in many drugs that have occasionally triggered anaphylaxis—a potentially life-threatening reaction that can cause rashes, a plummeting blood pressure, shortness of breath, and a fast heartbeat. Some allergists and immunologists believe a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against PEG, putting them at risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. The two vaccines both contain mRNA wrapped in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that help carry it to human cells but also act as an adjuvant, a vaccine ingredient that bolsters the immune response. The LNPs are “PEGylated”—chemically attached to PEG molecules that cover the outside of the particles and increase their stability and life span. PEGs were long thought to be biologically inert, but a growing body of evidence suggests they are not. As much as 72% of people have at least some antibodies against PEGs, according to a
  # 2016 study led by Samuel Lai, a pharmaco-engineer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, presumably as a result of exposure to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. About 7% have a level that may be high enough to predispose them to anaphylactic reactions, he found. Other studies have also found antibodies against PEG, but at lower levels.

  # Model - PEGylation is commonly used to extend half-life and limit volume of distribution of an increasing number of nucleic acid, peptide, and small molecule therapeutics.

  # Vector-Based Vaccines Come to the Fore in the COVID-19 Pandemic
  #
  # Six vaccine candidates in clinical trials for COVID-19 employ viruses to deliver genetic cargo that, once inside our cells, instructs them to make SARS-CoV-2 protein. This stimulates an immune response that ideally would protect recipients from future encounters with the actual virus. Three candidates rely on weakened human adenoviruses to deliver the recipe for the spike protein of the pandemic coronavirus, while two use primate adenoviruses and one uses measles virus.
  # Most viral vaccines are based on attenuated or inactivated viruses. An upside of using vectored vaccines is that they are easy and relatively cheap to make. The adenovirus vector, for example, can be grown up in cells and used for various vaccines. Once you make a viral vector, it is the same for all vaccines, says Florian Krammer, a vaccinologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “It is just the genetic information in it that is different,” he explains.
  # Once inside a cell, viral vectors hack into the same molecular system as SARS-CoV-2 and faithfully produce the spike protein in its three dimensions. This resembles a natural infection, which provokes a robust innate immune response, triggering inflammation and mustering B and T cells.
  # But the major downside to the human adenoviruses is that they circulate widely, causing the common cold, and some people harbor antibodies that will target the vaccine, making it ineffective
  #
  # . In any case, it is necessary to directly compare different vaccines based on Ad5, VSV, chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3, Ad26, and modified vaccinia Ankara, in order to identify optimal vaccine vector(s).
  # Heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens deliver the same or similar antigens through different vaccine types, the first to prime and the second to boost the immune system.

  # Petrovsky says children generally react more strongly to vaccines than adults do, and that could be a huge drawback in countries with young populations such as India. “With vectors you are always trying to find the sweet spot,” says Petrovsky, which is their Achilles’s heel.  “Too weak, and they don’t work. Too strong, and they are too toxic.” Petrovsky is involved in the development of Covax-19, a recombinant protein–based vaccine plus adjuvant that is in early clinical trials and was developed by his company Vaxine Pty in Australia.

  # VACCINES
  #  As with other mutations: it is unlikely that a few mutations render a vaccine ineffective. The vaccines under development induce antibodies to many sites on Spike, so even if one target doesn't work, others should. Still, important to investigate, as scientists are doing.

  # The UK SARS-CoV-2 multiply mutated variant VUI 202012/01 also has an interesting Spike deletion 69/70 we have been studying. The deletion is increasing in frequency (blue), as is the new UK variant (red) (Dec still going)

  # NERVTAG meeting on SARS-CoV-2 variant under investigation VUI-202012/01
  #     • Four analytic approaches were reviewed regarding the transmissibility of VUI-202012/01
  # o Growth rate from genomic data: which suggest a growth rate of VUI-202012/01 that
  # that is 71% (95%CI: 67%-75%) higher than other variants. - Increased growth rate 71% (67%-75%) relative to other lineages in circulation
  # o Studies of correlation between R-values and detection of the variant: which
  # suggest an absolute increase in the R-value of between 0.39 to 0.93.
  # o PCR ct values: which suggest a decrease of ct value of around 2 associated with
  # the new variant.
  # o Viral load inferred from number of unique genome reads: which suggests 0.5
  # increase in median log10 inferred viral load in Y501 versus N501. - Increased viral load (~4x based on RT-PCR; ~5x based on genome reads)
  # No evidence for increased disease severity (4 deaths reported for ~1000 cases)
  #  4 probable reinfections / ~915 infections. This feels quite high but would need to be compared to reinfection rates for other lineages.

  # It was noted that whilst previous variants have successfully emerged in periods of low prevalence without clear evidence of having a selective advantage, the emergence and subsequent dominance of VUI-202012/01 in a period of relatively high prevalence suggests VUI-202012/01 does have a selective advantage over other variants.
  # • It was noted that VUI-202012/01 has demonstrated exponential growth during a period when national lockdown measures were in place.

  # In summary, NERVTAG has moderate confidence that VUI-202012/01 demonstrates a substantial increase in transmissibility compared to other variants.

  # NERVTAG concluded that there are currently insufficient data to draw any conclusion on:
  # Disease severity: 4 deaths in around 1000 cases have been identified but further work is needed to compare this fatality rate with comparable data sets.
  # o Antigenic escape. The location of the mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein raises the possibility that this variant is antigenically distinct from prior variants. Four probable reinfections have been identified amongst 915 subjects with this variant but further work is needed to compare this reinfection rate with comparable data sets.

  # https://twitter.com/GuptaR_lab/status/1340438927254167554
  # When we made this deletion alone in a simplified lab virus that has the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we found that it was twice as infectious on cells that expressed the surface receptor used by the virus. This could potentially explain why VUI 202012/01 appears to spread faster.


  # we estimated that the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant VOC 202012/01 is more transmissible than existing circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 50-74% more transmissible than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2.

  # Countries the B.1.1.7 variant has been found in: UK, Denmark, Singapore, Australia, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, Lebanon, France, Israel, Italy.


  # One of the delH69/V70+ N501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, is comprised of over 1400 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the UK and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (delH69/V70 and del144/145) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). Some of these mutations have possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7.

  # This variant bears some concerning features; firstly the H69/V70
  # deletion which we show to increase infectivity by two fold. Secondly the 144 which may
  # affect binding by antibodies related to 4A811. Thirdly, the N501Y mutation that may have
  # higher binding affinity for ACE2 and a second RBD mutation A570D that could alter Spike
  #  RBD structure. Finally, a mutation at the furin cleavage site could represent further
  # adaptative change.
  #
  # we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance.
  #
  # Zoonotic pandemics follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. Often, pandemics wane, becoming endemic pathogens. Sustained circulation requires evasion of protective immunity elicited by previous infections.
  #
  # These are:
  # 1. Spike N501Y which alters a key residue responsible for binding to the human ACE2 receptor
  # 2. Deletion of spike residues 69 and 70 which may aid antibody escape
  # 3. Spike P681H which is adjacent to the furin cleavage site
  # 4. Knockout of accessory gene ORF8
  #
  # If we look at a detailed phylogenetic tree of this variant, rapid spread is also apparent. We also see that almost all the 501Y.V1 cases are in the UK, with 1 sequenced case from Australia (quarantined), 1 from Italy and 9 cases from Denmark (https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/variants/20b-501y-v1). 8/17
  #

  # Fortuitously, the spike deletion at residues 69 and 70 broke one of the three PCR probes used in the TaqPath assay and so has been able to track spread of variant by comparing tests where all three probes light up vs tests where only two light up. 9/17

    It’s not clear, by the way, how B.1.1.7 ended up with so many mutations. But often, multiple mutations are seen when a virus infects someone with a compromised immune system. In those patients, the virus can stay in the system for weeks and months, rather than a few days; they are often then treated with convalescent plasma.
    One hypothesis for the emergence of this lineage, given the large number of mutations relative to the background mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, is that it may have arisen through intra-host evolution in one or more individuals with prolonged viral replication43,44 This hypothesis is supported by the long branch length connecting the lineage to the remaining sequences in our phylogenetic tree (Suppl Fig. S10). The N501Y mutation is one of several spike mutations that emerged in an immunocompromised individual in the US who had prolonged viral replication for over 20 weeks44. 5.

    The N501Y mutation has recently been identified in a new lineage in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), with some preliminary evidence that it may be more transmissible



  >
    The deletion of two amino acids at positions 69-70 in spike has arisen in multiple independent  circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2, is linked to immune escape in immunocompromised patients and enhances viral infectivity in vitro (6, 7).

    This deletion is also responsible for certain  commercial diagnostic assays failing to detect the spike glycoprotein gene (S gene drop-out), with genomic data confirming these S gene target failures are primarily due to the new variant  (1).







    COUNTER: It should be noted, however, that the observed diversity within this lineage cannot be explained by a single long-term infection in one individual because the lineage contains circulating intermediate mutants with subsets of the main mutations that characterise the lineage. I If evolution within long-term infections were the explanation for the evolution of this lineage then one would need to invoke a transmission chain that passes through multiple individuals

    In South Africa, the country with the world’s biggest HIV epidemic, one concern has been the possibility of prolonged viral replication and intra-host evolution in the context of HIV infection, although the limited evidence so far does not suggest that HIV infection is associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication4

    Further, antigenic evolution, even within non-immuno-suppressed individuals, could offer an alternative explanation, given that several of the individual sites in spike appear to be under selective pressure worldwide, and that several of the identified mutations have been found in circulating lineages together.

    Whilst we have yet to characterise how the mutations (particularly those in the RBM) affect antigenicity, it is plausible that high levels of population immunity could have driven the selection of this lineage

    Whilst the full implications of this new lineage in South Africa are yet to be determined, these findings highlight the importance of coordinated molecular surveillance systems in all parts of the world, to enable early detection and characterisation of new lineages and to inform the global pandemic response.
    Whilst we have yet to characterise how the mutations (particularly those in the RBM) affect antigenicity, it is plausible that high levels of population immunity could have driven the selection of this lineage.



    The deletion of two amino acids at positions 69-70 in spike has arisen in multiple independent  circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Of particular note this deletion, H69/V70, often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F, that have been shown to increase binding affinity to hACE2 and reduce binding with monoclonal antibodies) and its prevalence is rising in parts of Europe.

    3 A recent analysis highlighted the potential for enhanced transmissibility of viruses with deletions in the NTD, including H69/V70. Here we show that the H69/V70 deletion increases Spike mediated infectivity by two-fold over a single round of infection.

    Many are interested in using the 69/70 deletion to scan for cases of the new #SARSCoV2 variants. As it can impact some probes (seen as an 'S drop-out' in PCR), it can be a high-throughput way to check for the 'SE England' variant - but some important things to remember!

    First, the 69/70 deletion has arisen multiple times independently: not everything with 69/70 is the SE England variant! You can see that 69/70del appears many times here: notably it's associated with 501Y.V1 (English variant) AND 453 & 439.n particular, S:N439K is widespread across Europe, and about 3/4 of the sequences in this cluster have the 69/70del. So there's a fair chance a 69/70del in continental Europe is part of this cluster, not the 'new variant' from England. In the UK & particularly SE England, using the 69/70del as a proxy for the variant works because it is in many areas the most common variant. In other places, where frequency is expected to be lower, it's very important to double-check S drop-out results!!We have two sources of information about the spread of the new variant. The most reliable is genomics data, but this has a lag period, and most samples can't be tested in this way. The second is "S dropout", but it doesn't uniquely identify B.1.1.7

  >
    In addition to the primary factors 1 (mutational composition) and 2 (rapid spread), we also see higher viral loads in 501Y.V1 cases with Ct values on average 2 units lower. 12/17

  >
    Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs.
    The observation of potential selection for specific variants coinciding with the presence of antibodies from convalescent plasma is supported by the experimental finding of reduced susceptibility of these viruses to plasma. er, we were able to document real-time emergence of a variant H69/V70 in the NTD of Spike that has been increasing in frequency in Europe. In the case we report that it was not clear that the emergence of the antibody escape variant was the primary reason for treatment failure.

    During pandemics neither the infected patient nor subsequently infected individuals impart an immunological pressure on the virus. However, during a long-term persistent infection, virus replicates in the presence of endogenous or supplemented (e.g. convalescent sera or therapeutic monoclonal) antibody mediated immunity. Viral evolution in such patients may foreshadow preferred avenues of adaption in immune experienced populations






    But PCR tests work by looking for a few short lengths of the viral RNA, not the whole thing. And by lucky chance, the standard PCR test looks at three different chunks, one of which happened to include the two areas removed by 69-70del mutation.

    This doesn’t mean that the PCR tests don’t work. The tests look at three sites “precisely to have belt and braces” when hunting the virus, says Birney. So PCR tests which return positive results on two of the sites, but are negative on the 69-70 site, are probably telling us that the patient has B.1.1.7, not the original SARS-Cov2 strain. This means it’s been much easier to keep track of the virus. That’s why, says Birney, Patrick Vallance was able to give so much detail in his presentation of where it has spread in the UK.  It’s also part of why we can make any sort of estimate about the increase in R. If we were relying on genome sequencing, even though the UK has genuinely world-leading genomic surveillance, we’d have much less info.

    Research is vitally needed into whether lateral flow devices for antigen and antibody detection can detect emerging strains and the immune responses to them, particularly given reports that S signal in PCR based tests are frequently negative in the new variant.

    Emergence and rapid spread of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage with multiple spike mutations in South Africa. This new lineage has three mutations at key sites in the RBD (K417N, E484K and N501Y). Two of these (E484K and N501Y) are within the receptor-binding motif (RBM), the main functional motif that forms the interface with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor

    The N501Y mutation has recently been identified in a new lineage in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), with some preliminary evidence that it may be more transmissible29,30

  >
    N501 forms part of the binding loop in the contact region of hACE2, forming a hydrogen bond with Y41 in hACE231-33. It also stabilises K353, one of the virus-binding hotspot residues on hACE234. It is one of the key positions that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV and contributes to the enhanced binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for hACE231,34 The N501Y mutation has been shown through deep mutation scanning and in a mouse model to enhance binding affinity to hACE2

  >
    The E484K mutation is uncommon, being present in <0.02% of sequences from outside South Africa. E484 is also in the RBM, and interacts with the K31 interaction hotspot residue of hACE2. There is some evidence that the E484K mutation may modestly enhance binding affinity35.

  >
    K417 is a unique hACE-2 interacting residue that forms a salt bridge interaction across the central contact region with D30 of hACE231,32. This is the most striking difference in the RBD-hACE2 complex between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV, and contributes to the enhanced binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to hACE23.Deep mutational scanning suggests that the K417N mutation has minimal impact on binding affinity to hACE2

  >
    We next examined the lineages where Spike mutations in the RBD were identified at high frequency, in particular co-occurring with N439K, an amino acid replacement recently reported to be expanding in Europe and detected across the world. N439K appears to have reduced susceptibility to a small subset of monoclonals targeting the RBD, whilst retaining affinity for ACE2 in vitro. The proportion of viruses with ΔH69/ΔV70 only increased from August 2020 when it co-occurred with the second N439K lineage. As of November 26th, remarkably there were twice as many cumulative sequences with the deletion as compared to the single N439K. Due to their high sampling rates the country with the highest proportion of N439K+ ΔH69/ΔV70 versus N439K alone is England. The low levels of sequencing in most countries indicate N439K’s prevalence could be relatively high3. In Scotland, where early growth of N439K was high (forming N439K lineage i that subsequently went extinct with other lineages after the lockdown3), there is now an inverse relationship with 546 versus 177 sequences for N439K and N439K+ΔH69/ΔV70 respectively (as of November 26th). These differences therefore likely reflect differing epidemic growth characteristics and timings of the introductions the N439K variants with or without the deletion.


    The second significant cluster with ΔH69/ΔV70 and RBD mutants involves Y453F, another RBD mutation that increases binding affinity to ACE2, along with F486L and N501T related to human-mink transmissions in Denmark9 (Figure 4). This sub-lineage, termed ‘Cluster 5’ was part of a wider lineage in which the same deleted region (ΔH69/ΔV70) was observed. In Y453F lineages, the mutant virus demonstrates reduced susceptibility to sera from recovered COVID-19 patients (https://files.ssi.dk/Mink-cluster-5-short-report_AFO2). The ΔH69/ΔV70 was first detected in the Y453F background on August 24th and thus far appears limited to Danish sequences

    A third lineage containing the same out of frame deletion ΔH69/ΔV70 has arisen with another RBD mutation N501Y (Figure 5, supplementary figure 2). Based on its location it might be expected to escape antibodies similar to COV2-24995. In addition, when SARS-CoV-2 was passaged in mice for adaptation purposes, N501Y emerged and increased pathogenicity. Early sequences with N501Y alone were isolated both in Brazil and USA in April 2020. N501Y + ΔH69/ΔV70sequences appear to have been detected first in the UK in September 2020, with the crude cumulative number of N501Y + ΔH69/ΔV70 mutated sequences now exceeding the single mutant (Figure 5). Of particular concern is a sublineage of around 350 sequences (Figure 6) bearing six spike mutations across the RBD (N501Y, A570D) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H) as well as the ΔH69/ΔV70 in England (Figure 7). This cluster has a very long branch (Figure 6).








  # While new mutations occur at a steady rate, they have not, until B.1.1.7, accumulated into a single strain, suggesting that this new variant has acquired them through selection for improved properties. As viruses are transmitted, those that allow for increased virological ‘success’ can be selected for, which changes the properties of the virus over time. This typically leads to more transmission and less virulence and for human infecting coronaviruses the end result of this evolutionary process might look like the other 4 commonly found coronaviruses that cause symptoms that we recognise as the common cold – however, these 4 common cold viruses are highly contagious. The new B.1.1.7 may be on the path towards this but is not there yet, and still appears to have all the human lethality that the original had but with an increased ability to transmit. Hopefully, it does not alter the immune response sufficiently to interfere with the vaccine protection. While the consequences of this new strain are still being worked out, it seems prudent to try to reduce its spread around the UK and the rest of the world.”






  # What evolutionary processes or selective pressures might have given rise to lineage B.1.1.7?

  # Outside of spike, the ORF8 Q27stop mutation truncates the ORF8 protein or renders it inactive and thus allows further downstream mutations to accrue. Early on during the pandemic multiple virus isolates with deletions leading to loss of ORF8 expression were isolated worldwide, including a large cluster in Singapore with a deletion leading to both a truncated Orf7b and ablated ORF8 expression. The Singaporean strain, which had a 382nt deletion, was associated with a milder clinical infection and less post-infection inflammation, however this cluster died out at the end of March after Singapore successfully implemented control measures (Young et al. 2020). Subsequent work has found that the ORF8 deletion has only a very modest effect on virus replication in human primary airway cells compared to viruses without the deletion, leading to a slight replication lag compared to viruses with the deletion (Gamage et al. 2020). As ORF8 is usually 121 amino acids long it is likely the stop codon at position 27 observed in lineage B.1.1.7 results in a loss of function.







  # Are the UK and South Africa variants the same? No. See this thread for more info: Critically, the SA variant does not have the 69/70 deletion we see in the UK variant.

  # -
  #  They both share the same mutation in spike: N501Y (N->Y at position 501). However, the 2 variants have arisen separately.
  #  oth the UK & SA variants also sit on 'long branches'. This means they have more mutations (different in each) than we would expect. Both also have a higher number of mutations in spike.

  # What about the 'UK'* (southeast England - B.1.1.7) and 'Welsh'* variants?

  # They also both have the 501Y mutation, but the Welsh variant does not have the 69/70 deletion while the 'UK' one does. They also differ in many other positions.

  # Here a simple table comparing the two variants with the 501Y Spike mutations in South Africa (501Y.V2) and the U.K. (B.1.1.7).


  # What does it mean when we see a mutation arising independently multiple times?
  #
  # It's hard to say. Mutations arising multiple times can mean they give an advantage (that's why we keep seeing them). But it's not straightforward to show this conclusively.
  #
  # However, we may see modest reductions in vaccine efficacy due to antigenic drift and will likely need a process in the coming years by which we update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses. 17/18
  #
  # Going forward, I suggest:
  # 1. Emerging variants should be assayed against sera from recovered and vaccinated individuals to test for antigenic effects
  # 2. Immunization records should be connected to genomic surveillance to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections

  ########### 12/22 ######

    #    In late December 2020, evidence began to emerge that a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, Variant of
    # Concern 202012/01 (henceforth VOC 202012/01), was prevalent and rapidly outcompeting
    # preexisting variants in at least three regions of England: the South East, London and the East of
    # England (1). This variant seems to have increased in incidence during the last period of national
    # lockdown (November 5th - December 2nd 2020), and continued to increase following the
    # lockdown despite many of the affected areas being in the (then) highest level of restrictions
    # (“Tier 3”). Concern over this variant led the UK government to place parts of these three
    # regions under “Tier 4” restrictions on 20th December, a package of control measures broadly
    # equivalent to those enacted during the nationwide lockdown in England in November. Our
    # current understanding of effective pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control of
    # SARS-CoV-2 does not reflect potential epidemiological and clinical characteristics of VOC
    # 202012/01. Early estimates of the transmissibility and disease severity for this novel variant are
    # crucial for informing rapid policy responses to this potential threat.

    # VOC 202012/01 is defined by 17 mutations (14 non-synonymous mutations and 3 deletions) among which eight are located in the spike protein. At least three mutations have a potential biological significance. Mutation N501Y is one of the key contact residues in the receptor binding domain and has been shown to enhance binding affinity to human ACE2 (2, 3). The function of mutation P681H is unclear, but it is located immediately adjacent to the furin cleavage site in spike, a known region of importance for infection and transmission (4, 5). The deletion of two amino acids at positions 69-70 in spike has arisen in multiple independent circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2, is linked to immune escape in immunocompromised patients and enhances viral infectivity in vitro (6, 7). This deletion is also responsible for certain commercial diagnostic assays failing to detect the spike glycoprotein gene (S gene drop-out), with genomic data confirming these S gene target failures are primarily due to the new variant. Accordingly, molecular evidence is consistent with a potentially altered infectiousness phenotype for this variant

    # Characterising the transmissibility and severity of VOC 202012/01
    #     To understand possible biological mechanisms for the observed dynamics associated with VOC
    # 202012/01, we considered four alternative hypotheses for why the new variant might be
      # spreading more efficiently: increased infectiousness; immune escape; increased susceptibility among children; and shorter generation time.
      # The preprint considers higher infectiousness per contact, immune escape, a change in the susceptibility of children and a shorter generation time
      # https://twitter.com/BillHanage/status/1341857733633581063

      # but given our projections of a rapid rise in future incidence from VOC 202012/01 without additional control measures, there is an urgent need to consider what new approaches may be required to sufficiently reduce the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

      # VACCINE : The rise in transmission from VOC 202012/01 has several potential implications for vaccination. First, it means prompt and efficient vaccine delivery and distribution is even more important to reduce the impact of the epidemic in the near future. Moreover, increased transmission resulting from VOC 202012/01 will raise the herd immunity threshold, meaning the potential future burden of SARS-CoV-2 is larger and it will require higher vaccination coverage to achieve herd immunity. This implies vaccination timelines will also be a crucial determinant of future burden in other countries where similar new variants are present. Second, there is a need to determine whether VOC 202012/01 – or any subsequent emerging lineages – could affect the efficacy of vaccines. Vaccine developers may therefore need to consider experimenting with variant sequences as a precautionary measure, and powering post-licensure studies to detect differences in efficacy between the preexisting and new variants.


      # although VOC 202012/01 was first identified in England, a rapidly spreading variant with similar phenotypic properties has also been detected in South Africa (20), where there has been a marked increase in 13 transmission in late 2020.

  #    An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the Phase 3 trial of the investigational COVID-19 vaccine known as mRNA-1273 reviewed trial data and shared its interim analysis with the trial oversight group on Nov. 15, 2020. This interim review of the data suggests that the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults. The interim analysis comprised 95 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among volunteers. The DSMB reported that the candidate was safe and well-tolerated and noted a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.5%. The findings are statistically significant, meaning they are likely not due to chance. 90 of the cases occurred in the placebo group and 5 occurred in the vaccinated group.

  #     The Moderna vaccine is a new kind of vaccine based on the genetic material that makes up the coronavirus. Snippets of RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) are enclosed in a nano-capsule and injected into someone's arm. The RNA contains instructions to make a protein found of the outer surface of the coronavirus. This protein is what stimulates the immune system to make antibodies against the virus. The idea is that if this harmless protein in the vaccine can generate those antibodies, then if the vaccinated individual is exposed to the virus, their immune system will be able to fight it off.

  #   Our data extend recent preclinical studies of inactivated virus vaccines and DNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.

  #   The potency of a single vaccination with our Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate is supported by our recently reported study in non-human primates where a single dose provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung and near complete protection against viral replication in the nose. In this prior preclinical study, all sham vaccinated control animals had detectable virus in both lung and nose for 7–14 days. In vaccinated non-human primates, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers.
  #
  #   Though correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection have not yet been determined, measurement of serum neutralizing activity has been shown to be a mechanistic correlate of protection for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza14 and respiratory syncytial virus,15 and is generally accepted as a functional biomarker of the in vivo humoral response.16 In rhesus macaques given DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers were correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.17 Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses have been associated with vaccine-induced protection against challenge18 or subsequent rechallenge after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque model.19

      # The lack of apparent protection observed in the United Kingdom and France, where BCG vaccination was administered to older children, suggests that either trained immunity observed when infants are vaccinated is no longer achieved in older children or it may be of shorter duration. There may be a “critical window” early in life where BCG vaccination can result in lifelong enhanced immune surveillance. It is also possible that the BCG strains used, or the administration route, also affect the innate immune response to vaccination

      # The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating in recent history. The bacillus Calmette−Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis also confers broad protection against other infectious diseases, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the severity of COVID-19. This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.

    #
    #  There are circumstances in which a vaccine with an efficacy between 40% and 70% could prevent an epidemic and between 60% and 80% could extinguish an ongoing epidemic, but these would require a potentially unachievable 100% coverage of the population. All of this suggests that a vaccine alone may not allow everything to return to normal immediately (i.e., stop social distancing) unless both vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage are fairly high.
    #
    #   this does not mean that a vaccine with a lower efficacy may not be useful. For example, a vaccine could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system so that it is not overwhelmed (e.g., a vaccine efficacy of 40% could prevent ≥2.8 million patients from requiring a ventilator and ≥89.5 million hospital bed days). In addition, vaccination could be combined with other control measures (e.g., test–trace–isolate, mandatory masking).
    #
    #   A vaccine with a lower efficacy could also be used for targeted vaccination (e.g., response to a local outbreak or to protect certain groups). As this study shows, even if a vaccine does not prevent or extinguish an epidemic, it can still save a considerable number of lives, hospitalizations, and costs.

  # We tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that despite the relatively high degree of structural homology between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 μM), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed to the SARS-CoV RBD. Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.

  # Modified (recombinant) adenovirus vectors, including replication incompetent types, can deliver DNA coding for specific antigens. Recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) and adenovirus type-26 (Ad26) are being used as vectors in candidate COVID-19 vaccines.[37][38] The goal is to express the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1) is being used in a trial of a COVID-19 vaccine.[39] The vaccine is known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Jenner Institute) or AZD1222 (AstraZeneca). Another one is ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S, which was reported as a vaccine preventing mice mutants with human ACE2 (hACE2) receptors to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.[40][41]
  #
  # Possible issues with using Adenovirus as vaccine vectors include: the human body develops immunity to the vector itself, making subsequent booster shots difficult or impossible.[42] In some cases, people have pre-existing immunity to Adenoviruses, making vector delivery ineffective.[43]

  # The concerns are directed in particular to the following pointsDr Yeadon’s (former Pfizer VP) Coronavirus Vaccine Safety Petition:
  # https://dryburgh.com/mike-yeadon-coronavirus-vaccine-safety-concerns-petition/

  # The formation of so-called “non-neutralizing antibodies” can lead to an exaggerated immune reaction, especially when the test person is confronted with the real, “wild” virus after vaccination. This so-called antibody-dependent amplification, ADE, has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats, for example. In the course of these studies all cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus.
  # The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.
  #  The mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). 70% of people develop antibodies against this substance – this means that many people can develop allergic, potentially fatal reactions to the vaccination.
  # The much too short duration of the study does not allow a realistic estimation of the late effects. As in the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination, millions of healthy people would be exposed to an unacceptable risk if an emergency approval were to be granted and the possibility of observing the late effects of the vaccination were to follow. Nevertheless, BioNTech/Pfizer apparently submitted an application for emergency approval on December 1, 2020.


  # In the Step trial, the risk of acquiring HIV was particularly high among men who were uncircumcised and Ad5 seropositive men who reported having unprotected anal sex with a partner who was HIV seropositive or who had unknown serostatus as baseline.
  #
  # The Step study showed an overall increased risk of acquisition (HR 1.4, p< 0.03); however, the group at highest risk was uncircumcised men who both had sex with men (MSM) and had high levels of pre-existing Ad5 antibodies
  #
  #
  # Given our results, it seems prudent to avoid use of Ad5-vectored vaccines in populations of uncircumcised or Ad5-seropositive men until more data become available. In contrast, a population (circumcised, Ad5-seronegative men) in which vaccination did not carry an increased risk of HIV infection was clearly identified.
  #
  # The difference in risk of HIV acquisition prior to unblinding increased with baseline Ad5 titer, a dose-effect relationship that suggests but does not prove a biologic effect of prior Ad5 immunity on susceptibility to HIV infection after vaccination
  #
  # Other exploratory studies have indicated that the vaccine enhances HIV replication in CD4 T cells or that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells could be more susceptible to HIV infection. This finding suggests that although Ad5 vectors have been commonly employed for vaccine development due to their potent immunogenicity, the advantages of Ad5 as a vector may be dampened by the high HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells it induces.

  #   A consensus conference about Ad5 vectors held in 2013 and sponsored by the National Institutes of Health indicated the most probable explanation for these differences related to the potential counterbalancing effects of envelope immune responses in mitigating the effects of the Ad5 vector on HIV-1 acquisition. The conclusion of this consensus conference warned that non-HIV vaccine trials that used similar vectors in areas of high HIV prevalence could lead to an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in the vaccinated population.

#    However, it should be noted that the large-scale spread of COVID-19 is likely to be heterogeneous because many extrinsic factors, such as weather and control measures, may affect the transmission of pathogen. The transmission heterogeneity revealed in the current study was in a local outbreak, which indicates that some intrinsic properties of the pathogen might have contributed to the heterogeneity. This finding is more meaningful for the development of targeted control measures.
#   >
#    The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties and night clubs.
#
#    Multiple lines of evidence at the individual- and population-level strongly indicate the role of SSEs in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and that we should not overlook the heterogeneity in numbers of secondary infections57. Our mental picture should not be that most people transmit to two or three other people, but instead a small number of infections dominate the transmission while most others fail to have secondary infections. The distribution of R0 is over-dispersed with a high probability of extinction on the lower end, and a long tail on the higher end

#
#    It has become increasingly clear that the COVID-19 epidemic is characterized by overdispersion whereby the majority of the transmission is driven by a minority of infected individuals.
#

#    Dispersion parameter, K
#
#    Dispersion parameter, K
# Different pathogens will have different ways in which they spread and statisticians use K, the so-called dispersion parameter, to describe how variable the infection can be. For some diseases, the variation will not be large, as shown below.Simply put, a low K value suggests that a small number of infected people are responsible for large amounts of disease transmission. For the 1918 influenza, the number K is thought to be around 1, and perhaps 40% of infected people might not pass on the virus to anybody else. But for diseases like Sars, Mers and COVID-19 with K as low as 0.1, this proportion rises to 70%. In contrast, large outbreaks will be initiated by only few super-spreaders, as shown below.
#
# Why is K so important?
# There are two reasons why scientists are looking into the role of variability in controlling coronavirus transmission. First, super-spreading events are critical in the late stages of the epidemic when the virus is almost eradicated. Small values of K mean that one infected person can trigger many new cases in a very short time. If this happens, the epidemic can quickly rebound, even if locally eradicated.
#
# Outbreaks in Seoul nightclubs in South Korea, meatpacking plants in the US, and coal mines in Poland show how damaging super-spreading events can be. So governments need to be diligent in identifying the risks associated with the reopening of industries and entertainment. A way to identify and track potential super-spreaders is fundamental to prevent future outbreaks.
#
# But there is also a glimmer of hope. If indeed K is as low as 0.1, 70% of infected individuals fail to pass on the virus.
# -
#    'Endo_et_al_04_09_2020
#
#
# As a result, most cases arriving from outside the country or region might recover without starting a new outbreak. It might, therefore, be easier to eradicate the disease and to maintain the disease-free status than suggested by the average reproductive number, R.
#
# While R is not going to be replaced by K in the daily press briefing, both are needed to understand how COVID-19 spreads.

  # l-Atab et al. developed a reusable hydrophobic mask and proposed that the hydrophobicity of the mask material might contribute to repelling the droplet (El-Atab et al. 2020). However, the role of hydrophobicity in filtration efficiency, IPE, and OPE remains unclear. Future studies may focus on the influence of material properties on the fit of the mask, and how the transmission of real viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, is altered by wearing the masks.


  # ### THERAPEUTIC quotes

  #   'Peacock_et_al_09_30_2020


  # Two studies suggest that the furin cleavage peptide motifs at the S1/S2 CS enables WT SARS318 CoV-2 virus to utilise neuropilin as a cellular attachment/entry factor (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020). However, since 293T cells express neuropilin and lentiviral pseudotypes (PV) lacking the furin CS enter these cells more efficiently than PV containing it, this suggests that neuropilin is not responsible for the entry differences between furin cleavage mutants.
  #
  #
  # It has been reported that TMPRSS2 is enriched in nasal and bronchial tissues(Qi et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020a; Sungnak et al., 2020b), implying that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory droplets might be enhanced for virus bearing an intact versus a deleted S1/S2 boundary

  ### ANIMAL TRANSMISSION HEAD
  # Available evidence suggests that the virus is predominantly transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and close contact, but there are also examples of transmission between humans and animals.

      #   On the basis of these data, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools may be less important in community transmission than initially feared. This would be another manner by which SARS-CoV-2 differs drastically from influenza, for which school-based transmission is well recognized as a significant driver of epidemic disease and forms the basis for most evidence regarding school closures as public health strategy.11 12
      #
      #   Although 2 reports are far from definitive, the researchers provide early reassurance that school-based transmission could be a manageable problem, and school closures may not have to be a foregone conclusion, particularly for elementary school–aged children who appear to be at the lowest risk of infection. Additional support comes from mathematical models, which find that school closures alone may be insufficient to halt epidemic spread13 and have modest overall impacts compared with broader, community-wide physical distancing measures.14

      #   It would be beneficial to compare attack rates across households, worker dormitories and prisons, to better understand which factors influence the risk of transmission between people who share a living space. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the total number of residents in these dormitories and prisons, which prevented us from deriving attack rates and making this comparison.

      #   In addition to these settings with maximum cluster sizes of more than 100 cases per cluster, we identified five further settings with maximum cluster sizes between 50 and 100: sport (65 cases) (Korean Centre for Diease Control & Prevention, 2020), bar (80 cases) (Sim, 2020), wedding (98 cases) (Ministry of Health – New Zealand, 2020), work (97 cases) (Park et al., 2020) and conference (89 cases) (Marcelo & O'brien, 2020).

      #   Most clusters involved fewer than 100 cases, with the exceptions being in healthcare (hospitals and elderly care), large religious gatherings, food processing plants, schools, shopping, and large co-habiting settings (worker dormitories, prisons and ships). Other settings with examples of clusters between 50–100 cases in size were weddings, sport, bar, shopping and work. The majority of our reports are from China and Singapore.

  #   Post-lockdown SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening in nearly ten million residents of Wuhan, China-
  # Previous studies have shown that asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus were infectious3, and might subsequently become symptomatic4. Compared with symptomatic patients, asymptomatic infected persons generally have low quantity of viral loads and a short duration of viral shedding, which decrease the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-25.
  #
  # Existing laboratory virus culture and genetic studies9,10 showed that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weakening over time, and the newly infected persons were more likely to be asymptomatic and with a lower viral load than earlier infected cases.
  #
  #
  # In a recent paper, Chen et al. (2020) investigated the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases among close contacts, and claimed no statistical difference between the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases versus that of symptomatic cases.
  #
  #
  # Additionally, Chen et al. (2020) showed that asymptomatic cases are more likely to produce asymptomatic cases relatively speaking, since the 6 secondary cases from asymptomatic primary cases consist 3 asymptomatic cases (50%). We note that such a phenomenon may as well have occurred in the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020 (Zhao et al., 2020), where a large proportion of asymptomatic cases were confirmed in the last 10 days of the quarantine period. Namely, asymptomatic COVID-19 cases may likely produce asymptomatic offspring.

  ### DiagnosticClaims

  #  How to get an antibody test
  #
  #  A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance that a positive result means you have antibodies from an infection with a different virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses). Note: Other coronaviruses cannot produce a positive result on a viral test for SARS-CoV-2.
  #
  #
  # You could have a current infection or been recently infected.
  # The test may be negative because it typically takes 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. It’s possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently. This means you could still spread the virus.
  # Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people who are infected may not ever develop antibodies.

  # Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people who are infected may not ever develop antibodies.

  # SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a wide range of other body fluids and compartments, but it is most frequently detected in respiratory material and, therefore, respiratory samples remain the sample type of choice for diagnostics.

   # For confirmation of a recent infection, acute and convalescent sera must be tested using a validated (semi)quantitative or quantitative assay.

  #  The first sample should be collected during the acute phase of illness, and the second sample at least 14 days after the initial sera was collected. Maximum antibody levels are expected to occur in the third/fourth week after symptom onset.

  #  Seroconversion or a rise in antibody titres in paired sera will help to confirm whether the infection is recent and/or acute. If the initial sample tests positive, this result could be due to a past infection that is not related to the current illness.
  # Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection, except in instances in which viral testing is delayed. An antibody test may not show if you have a current COVID-19 infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies.

  ### Serology

  ### This is just notes for my ref.
  # paper- Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study.

   #  If my antibody test is positive, am I immune?
   #  # Clouding the interpretation of a positive antibody test is that we do not yet know if antibodies against RBD make people immune. We also don’t know how much of this antibody against RBD is needed to ensure protection.
   #
   # not all of the antibody tests for COVID-19 measure antibodies against RBD. Some tests measure antibodies against parts of the virus that are not needed for cell entry. These antibodies that are not against the RBD will recognize the virus but will not block it from infecting human cells and triggering viral infection. So only antibodies that block the spike protein from connecting to the ACE2 receptor are guaranteed to provide immunity. And only antibody tests that measure the amount of these antibodies can predict immunity.

   # if through serology if you can find anti RBD- provide protective Immunity

   #      Value and Validity of Coronavirus Antibody Testing


  # The duration of the persistence of antibodies generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 is still under study [49, 174].


  # We know that in a test tube antibodies against the virus can neutralize it. That is, they can prevent the virus from entering into a human cell and causing an infection. But not every antibody is equally capable of preventing the virus from causing an infection. The very best antibodies are ones that neutralize the receptor binding domain of the new coronavirus spike protein that attaches to the host cell’s ACE2 receptor. The RBD is on the tip of the spike protein and is the part of the spike that touches ACE2. Antibodies against RBD block the very first step of viral infection, which is when the coronavirus attaches the human cell membrane.

  # While the size of an individual SARS-CoV-2 virus is very small (120 nm or 0.12 microns), the aerosol in which respiratory viruses are contained are larger, albeit still small enough to remain suspended in air for long periods. Aerosol size has major implications for the ability of masks and filters to remove it from the air, how deeply it will penetrate the lungs, and determines the loss rate due to gravitational settling in indoor spaces.
