  ##### Neutralising Antibody
  # (We will have more claims under RBD-specific antibodies and anti-S igm/igg which will be linked with vaccines)
  > Claim
    RBD-specific antibodies have greater potency to neutralize infection with divergent virus strains, suggesting that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can also serve as an important target for the development of potent and specific nAbs.

    One study identified lymphocyte changes in convalescent COVID-19 patients,  B cell changes seen during acute COVID-19 were largely restored in convalescence. T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients displayed persistent changes. Lymphocyte signatures defined 3 convalescent patient groups, one with poorer outcomes.

  # IMMUNITY ROBUTNESS IN EXTREME OLD PPL
  >
    A study on Extreme aged individuals and centenarians who were infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 found that they were ere able to elicit robust IgG and IgA antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The antibodies were able to neutralize the virus. Humoral responses were still detectable after 60 days from initial diagnosis. Recovered participants who are of extreme old age would be protected if re-exposed to the same SARS-CoV-2 viral variant.

  >
    A case study of a solid organ transplant recipient with COVID-19 showed patients with solid organ transplantation, or patients who are otherwise immunosuppressed, who recover from infection with SARS-CoV-2 may not develop sufficient protective immunity and are at risk of reinfection. Mere presence of neutralizing antibodies during primary infection was insufficient to confer protection against reinfection.

  # older people were more likely to test positive again if they had already tested positive.
  claim !Previouslyinfectedoldppl = In a Danish population-level observational study, researchers found that older people were more likely than younger people to test positive again if they had already tested positive. Protection in the population to be 80% or higher in those younger than 65 years, but to be approximately 47% in those aged 65 years and older. Thier data indicates that vaccination of previously infected individuals should be done because natural protection cannot be relied on.
