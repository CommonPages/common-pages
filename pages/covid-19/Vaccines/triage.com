  claim !CautionNSAID = Researchers have warned about using NSAIDs to prevent unpleasant side effects from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, as they have been shown to dampen antibody responses to the virus in mice.

    claim !NSAIDMouse = NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication.

  claim !ExpertRecommendation = Scientists have proposed interventions and provided recommendations for government to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. Recommendations include using media to communicate campaigns which leveraging evidence of Vaccine effectiveness, using behavioral insights to make vaccination more accessible & encourage early adopters communicate about their decision to take vaccine to accelerate the emergence of pro-vaccination norms.

  claim !Microarraypatch = One study demonstrated  SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccination via a microarray patch - they showed the vaccine, dry-coated on the patch is thermostable, and delivery of spike via HD-MAP induced greater cellular and antibody immune responses, with serum able to potently neutralize clinically relevant isolates including those from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. A single dose of HD-MAP-delivered spike are stable, immunogenic, and provided complete protection from a lethal virus challenge.
