There are 4 SARSCoV-2 vaccines that incorporate the 2P design - Moderna, BioNTech/Pfizer, Novavax and J&J.

  claim !Neutralizingactivity = One study reported that mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) elicit potent neutralizing activity against homologous pseudovirus. Cross-neutralization of strains with receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations is poor. Both RBD and non-RBD mutations mediate escape from vaccine-induced humoral immunity. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses.

  claim !Germinalcenters = A study demonstrated a remarkable capacity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines to induce robust germinal centers (GC) reactions for an extended period following vaccination. The induced GC reaction engages pre-existing as well as new B cell clones, which enables generation of high-affinity, broad, and durable humoral immunity.

   # Did you feel that your arm is on "fire" after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine? We looked at the lymph nodes draining the arm after mRNA vaccination in humans and those nodes DID have raging fires .. good kind of fires. We call them germinal centers.

These antibody responses cross-neutralized the B.1.351 variants, but at lower titers.

    Immediately after this press release (22 March 2021), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) notified NIAID, BARDA, and AstraZeneca that it was concerned by information released by AstraZeneca on initial data from its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.

They urged the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible.

  claim !Vaccineefficacy = A study conducted on 2026 HIV-negative adults in South Africa found that two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine had no efficacy against the B.1.351 variant in preventing mild-to-moderate Covid-19.

  claim !Animalchallenge = An animal challenge study (Syrian hamster model), demonstrated the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against clinical disease caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 VOCs. 9.5-fold reduction of virus neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated hamster sera against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. Minimal to no viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and no infectious virus was detected in lungs of vaccinated animals. Histopathological evaluation showed extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 replication in the control animals, but none in the vaccinated animals.

  # CLINICAL TRIAL
  >
    This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its effect on peak nasal viral load as a measure of infection and a proxy of infectiousness, in university students aged 18-26. 37500 participants. Estimated start date: March 22, 2021,  Estimated compeletion date: December 22, 2021
    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04811664



  # J&J
  claim !Phase1J&J = A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S enrolled 25 participants. Antibodies were detected in vaccine recipients by day 8 and were observed in all vaccine recipients by day 57 after a single immunization. T-cell responses were also generated in vaccine recipients.

  # Novavax
  claim !Phase3Novavax = In March of 2021, Novavax, Inc., announced final efficacy of 96.4% against mild, moderate and severe disease caused by the original COVID-19 strain in a pivotal Phase 3 trial in the United Kingdom (U.K.) of NVXâ€‘CoV2373, the companyâ€™s vaccine candidate. The company also announced the complete analysis of its Phase 2b trial taking place in South Africa, with efficacy of 55.4% among the HIV- negative trial participants in a region where the vast majority of strains are B1.351 escape variants. Across both trials, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated 100% protection against severe disease, including all hospitalization and death. Both studies achieved their statistical success criteria.

  claim !VaccineefficacyV1 = Novavax, Inc. announced that in the Phase 3 trial in the United Kingdom (U.K.) of NVXâ€‘CoV2373, the efficacy was 86.3% against the B.1.1.7/501Y.V1 variant circulating in the U.K Phase 3 trial in the United Kingdom (U.K.) of NVXâ€‘CoV2373.

  / Vaccine Efficacy against B.1.351
  claim !VaccineefficacyV2 = Efficacy in HIV-negative participants was 60.1%, and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% in HIV-negative participants. The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS-CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.

  claim !Epidemiologicalconsiderationeffectivedose = A model based study exploring the trade-offs of accelerating immunity vs fostering antigenic drift of the virus  illustrated that ultimately, the long term impacts of one-dose policy strategy, especially in terms of transmission and immune escape, will depend on the duration and strength of one-dose vaccinal immunity.
