  claim !CautionNSAID = Researchers have warned about using NSAIDs to prevent unpleasant side effects from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, as they have been shown to dampen antibody responses to the virus in mice.

    claim !NSAIDMouse = NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication.

  claim !ExpertRecommendation = Scientists have proposed interventions and provided recommendations for government to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. Recommendations include using media to communicate campaigns which leveraging evidence of Vaccine effectiveness, using behavioral insights to make vaccination more accessible & encourage early adopters communicate about their decision to take vaccine to accelerate the emergence of pro-vaccination norms.

  # CLINICAL TRIAL
  >
    This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its effect on peak nasal viral load as a measure of infection and a proxy of infectiousness, in university students aged 18-26. 37500 participants. Estimated start date: March 22, 2021,  Estimated compeletion date: December 22, 2021
