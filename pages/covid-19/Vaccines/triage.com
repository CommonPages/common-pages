    ChAdOx1, the chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine platform that was used in the Oxford trials, has previously been shown to safely induce potent humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that confer robust protection from Rift Valley fever disease in pregnant sheep that were vaccinated in the first trimester, without risks of maternal viraemia or miscarriage.

    PEG are believed to be chemically inert and are thus believed to be safe products. However, there are emerging reports of delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions to PEG-containing substances, suggesting that they have unrecognized allergic potential.

    Some allergists and immunologists believe a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against PEG, putting them at risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.
