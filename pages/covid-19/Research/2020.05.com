  // Early viral clearance and antibody kinetics of COVID-19 among asymptomatic carriers
  doi: https://doi.org/xyz
  ref 'Zhang_et_al_05_02_2020
    head = A total of 56 COVID-19 patients without symptoms at admission and 19 age-matched symptomatic patients were enrolled. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and total antibodies was tested. Young COVID-19 patients seem to be asymptomatic cases with early clearance of SARS-CoV-2

    > Background
      Asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their clinical characteristics, viral kinetics, and antibody responses remain unclear.
    > Methods
      A total of 56 COVID-19 patients without symptoms at admission and 19 age-matched symptomatic patients were enrolled. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was tested using transcriptase quantitative PCR, and the total antibodies (Ab), IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 were tested using Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immuno Assay.
    >  Results
      Among 56 patients without symptoms at admission, 33 cases displayed symptoms and 23 remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. 43.8% of the asymptomatic carriers were children and none of the asymptomatic cases had recognizable changes in C-reactive protein or interleukin-6, except one 64-year-old patient. The initial threshold cycle value of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers was similar to that in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients, but the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers (9.63 days) was shorter than pre-symptomatic patients (13.6 days). There was no obvious differences of the seropositive conversion rate of total Ab, IgG, and IgA among the three groups, though the rates of IgM varied largely. The average peak IgG and IgM COI of asymptomatic cases was 3.5 and 0.8, respectively, which is also lower than those in symptomatic patients with peaked IgG and IgM COI of 4.5 and 2.4 (p <0.05).
    > Conclusion
      Young COVID-19 patients seem to be asymptomatic cases with early clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and low levels of IgM generation but high total Ab, IgG and IgA. Our findings provide empirical information for viral clearance and antibody kinetics of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.

  // Variation in False-Negative Rate of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction–Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure
  doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.7326%2FM20-1495
  ref 'Kucirka_et_al_05_13_2020
    head = Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% on day 1 to 67% on day 4. Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection—particularly early in the course of infection.

    > Background:
      Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are being used to “rule out” infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results.

    > Objective:
      To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection.

    >  Design:
      Literature review and pooled analysis.

    > Setting:
      7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330).

    > Patients:
      A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    > Measurements:
      A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset.

    > Results:
      Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21.

    > Limitation:
      Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based.

    > Conclusion:
      Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection—particularly early in the course of infection—when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

  # Protective Immunity
  // Lack of Reinfection in Rhesus Macaques Infected with SARS-CoV-2
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226
  ref 'Bao_et_al_05_01_2020
    head = Rhesus macaques were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 during an early recovery phase from initial infection. The monkeys rechallenged with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain have failed to produce detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations and histopathological changes. Our results indicated that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection protects from subsequent reinfection.

    > Abstract
      A global pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing spread. It remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of reinfection. Rhesus macaques were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 during an early recovery phase from initial infection characterized by weight loss, interstitial pneumonia and systemic viral dissemination mainly in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The monkeys rechallenged with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain have failed to produce detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations and histopathological changes. A notably enhanced neutralizing antibody response might contribute the protection of rhesus macaques from the reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection protects from subsequent reinfection.

  // Low performance of rapid antigen detection test as frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104455
  ref 'Schohy_et_al_05_21_2020
    head = Higher viral loads are associated with better antigen detection rates. Unfortunately, the overall poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis.

    > Background
      Ensuring accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and for the clinical management of COVID-19. Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment and skilled staff limit the use of these time-consuming molecular techniques. Recently, several easy to perform rapid antigen detection tests were developed and recommended in some countries as the first line of diagnostic.
    >  Objectives
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of the Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip test, a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, in comparison to RT-qPCR.
    > Results
      148 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 106 positive RT-qPCR samples, 32 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 30.2%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR.
    > Conclusions
      Higher viral loads are associated with better antigen detection rates. Unfortunately, the overall poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis.

  // Comparison of seven commercial RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104412
  ref 'Kasteren_et_al_05_08_2020
    head = The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). PCR efficiency was ≥96 % for all assays and all may be used for routine diagnostics.

    > Abstract
      The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed.

      The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene).

      We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity.

      PCR efficiency was ≥96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

      We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.

  // Development and Potential Usefulness of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip Diagnostic Assay in a Pandemic Context
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00225
  ref 'Mertens_et_al_02_20_2020
    head = The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic.

    > Introduction:
      COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, an immunochromatographic (ICT) assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen on nasopharyngeal specimen, has been developed to identify positive COVID-19 patients allowing prompt clinical and quarantine decisions. In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm.
    > Materials and Methods:
      Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics.
    > Results:
      In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT <22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations.
    > Conclusion:
      The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.

  ref 'Porte_et_al_05_31_2020
    head = The RDT evaluated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples mainly obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads, despite the use of a non-validated sample material.

    > Objectives
      In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. This study was performed to evaluate a novel rapid antigen detection test (RDT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory samples.

    > Methods
      The fluorescence immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China) was evaluated using universal transport medium with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from suspected COVID-19 cases. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 real-time (RT)-PCR.

    > Results
      A total of 127 samples were included; 82 were RT-PCR-positive. The median patient age was 38 years, 53.5% were male, and 93.7% were from the first week after symptom onset. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (95% confidence interval 86.5–97.4%) and 100% (95% confidence interval 92.1–100%), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9. Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads.

    > Conclusions
      The RDT evaluated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples mainly obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads, despite the use of a non-validated sample material. The assay has the potential to become an important tool for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in situations with limited access to molecular methods.

    > Abstract
      In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. We compared the performance of four rapid antigen detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. Immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 assays from RapiGEN, Liming bio, Savant, and Bioeasy were evaluated using universal transport medium containing naso-oropharyngeal swabs from suspected Covid-19 cases. The diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. A total of 111 samples were included; 80 were RT-PCR positive. Median patients’ age was 40 years, 55% were female, and 88% presented within the first week after symptom onset. The evaluation of the Liming bio assay was discontinued due to insufficient performance. The overall sensitivity values of RapiGEN, Liming bio, and Bioeasy tests were 62.0% (CI95% 51.0–71.9), 16.7% (CI95% 10.0–26.5), and 85.0% (CI95% 75.6–91.2), respectively, with specificities of 100%. Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads (RapiGEN, 84.9%; Bioeasy, 100%). The study highlighted the significant heterogeneity of test performance among evaluated assays, which might have been influenced by the use of a non-validated sample material. The high sensitivity of some tests demonstrated that rapid antigen detection has the potential to serve as an alternative diagnostic method, especially in patients presenting with high viral loads in early phases of infection. This is particularly important in situations with limited access to RT-PCR or prolonged turnaround time. Further comparative evaluations are necessary to select products with high performance among the growing market of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.

  // Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30196-1
  ref 'To_et_al_05_20_2020
    head = Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.

    > Methods
      We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.

    > Findings
      Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1-7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0·15, 95% CI -0·19 to -0·11; R2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074-0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.

    > Interpretation
      Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

    head = C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a surrogate marker for cytokine storm and is associated with Vit D deficiency, based on retrospective data and indirect evidence we see a possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine storm.

    > Objectives
      To investigate the possible role of Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency via unregulated inflammation in COVID-19 complications and associated mortality.
    > Design
      The time-adjusted case mortality ratio (T-CMR) was estimated as the number of deceased patients on day N divided by the number of confirmed cases on day N-8. The adaptive average of T-CMR (A-CMR) was further calculated as a metric of COVID-19 associated mortality in different countries. A model based on positivity change (PC) and an estimated prevalence of COVID-19 was developed to determine countries with similar screening strategies. Mean concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in elderly individuals in countries with similar screening strategies were compared to investigate the potential impact of Vit D on A-CMR. We analyzed data showing a possible association between high C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentration (CRP greater than or equal to 1 mg/dL) and severe COVID-19. We estimated a link between Vit D status and high CRP in healthy subjects (CRP greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/dL) with an adjustment for age and income to explore the possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine production. Data Sources Daily admission, recovery, and deceased rate data for patients with COVID-19 were collected from Kaggle as of April 20, 2020. Screening data were collected from Our World in Data and official statements from public authorities. The mean concentration of 25(OH)D among the elderly for comparison with A-CMR was collected from previously published studies from different countries. Chronic factor data used in regression analysis was obtained from published articles. The correlation between Vit D and CRP was calculated based on 9,212 subject-level data from NHANES, 2009-2010.
    > Results
      A link between 25(OH)D and A-CMR in the US, France, Iran and the UK (countries with similar screening status) may exist. We observed an inverse correlation (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.84 to -1) between high CRP and 25(OH)D. Age and the family income status also correlated to high CRP and subjects with higher age and lower family income presented more incidences of high CRP. Our analysis determined a possible link between high CRP and Vit D deficiency and calculated an OR of 1.8 with 95%CI (1.2 to 2.6) among the elderly (age greater than or equal to 60 yo) in low-income families and an OR of 1.9 with 95%CI (1.4 to 2.7) among the elderly (age greater than or equal to 60 yo) in high-income families. COVID-19 patient-level data shows a notable OR of 3.4 with 95%CI (2.15 to 5.4) for high CRP in severe COVID-19 patients.
    > Conclusion
      Given that CRP is a surrogate marker for cytokine storm and is associated with Vit D deficiency, based on retrospective data and indirect evidence we see a possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine storm. Further research is needed to account for other factors through direct measurement of Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients.

    head = Utilisation of sustainable raw materials to develop bio-based masks is needed. Electrospun and compression moulded gluten can be used to develop bio-based masks. Gluten masks can be made flame retardant by adding <10 wt% of lanosol.

    > Abstract
      The onset of coronavirus pandemic has sparked a shortage of facemasks in almost all nations. Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 °C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (<10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten. The creation of these masks could simultaneously be effective in reducing the transmittance of infectious diseases and pave the way for environmentally benign sustainable products.

    head = Due to the shortage of masks during the [COVID-19] pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. As an immediate solution to promote "public droplet safety," we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs).

    > Abstract
      The main form of COVID-19 transmission is via "oral-respiratory droplet contamination" (droplet: very small drop of liquid) produced when individuals talk, sneeze, or cough. In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical "droplet precaution" to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of "environmental droplet contamination" (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote "public droplet safety," we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal "community droplet reduction solution" is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 "social distancing." All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a "community droplet reduction solution" (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.

    > Abstract
      The objective of this study was to investigate whether cotton mask worn by respiratory infection person could suppress respiratory droplet levels compared to medical mask. We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. Four 1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of particles with a size range of 20–1000 nm measured by number concentrations (NC0.02–1), temperature and relatively humidity, and cough/sneeze counts per hour were conducted for each volunteer. The paired t-tests were used for within-group comparisons in a bedroom and in a car. The results showed that there was no significant difference in NC0.02–1 or cough/sneeze counts between volunteers with medical masks and cotton masks in a bedroom or a car. We concluded that the cotton mask could be a potential substitute for medical mask for respiratory infection person in microenvironment with air conditioning. Healthy people may daily use cotton mask in the community since cotton mask is washable and reusable.

  // Surgical Mask Partition Reduces the Risk of Noncontact Transmission in a Golden Syrian Hamster Model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa644
  ref 'Chan_et_al_05_30_2020
    head = Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model.

    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium- to large-sized respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission may be possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures. Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19.

    > Methods
      We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naive hamsters into closed system units each comprising 2 different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression.

    > Results
      Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P = .019) of exposed naive hamsters. Unlike the severe manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naive hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues.

    > Conclusions
      SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model. This is the first in vivo experimental evidence to support the possible benefit of surgical mask in prevention of COVID-19 transmission, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.

    > Abstract
      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cloth masks are being used to control the spread of virus, but the efficacy of these loose-fitting masks is not well known. Here, tools and methods typically used to assess tight-fitting respirators were modified to quantify the efficacy of community- and commercially-produced fabric masks as PPE. Two particle counters concurrently sample ambient air and air inside the masks; mask performance is evaluated by mean particle removal efficiency and statistical variability when worn as designed and with a nylon overlayer, to independently assess fit and material. Worn as designed both commercial surgical masks and cloth masks had widely varying effectiveness (53-75% and 28-90% filtration efficiency, respectively). Most surgical-style masks improved with the nylon overlayer, indicating poor fit. This rapid testing method uses widely available hardware, requires only a few calculations from collected data, and provides both a holistic and aspect-wise evaluation of mask performance.

The weight of the available evidence warrants immediate attention to address the significance of aerosols and implications for public health protection.

    head = Respiratory droplet data from four published datasets were analysed to quantify the number and volume of droplets <100μm diameter produced by a typical cough and speaking event. Several scenarios were simulated that mimicked the presence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infectors.

    > Objectives
      While COVID-19 is known to be spread by respiratory droplets (which travel <2m horizontally), much less is known about its transmission via aerosols, which can become airborne and widely distributed throughout room spaces. In order to quantify the risk posed by COVID-19 infectors exhaling respiratory aerosols in enclosed spaces, we undertook a computer modelling study to simulate transmission in an office building.

    >  Methods
      Respiratory droplet data from four published datasets were analysed to quantify the number and volume of droplets <100μm diameter produced by a typical cough and speaking event (i.e. counting from 1 to 100). This was used in a stochastic model to simulate (10000 simulations) the number of respiratory particles, originating from a COVID-19 infector, that would be inhaled in one hour by a susceptible individual practicing socially distancing in a 4 x 4 x 2.5m office space. Several scenarios were simulated that mimicked the presence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infectors.

    >  Results
      On average, each cough and speaking event produced similar numbers of droplets <100μm diameter (median range = 971.9-1013.4). Computer simulations (ventilation rate=2AC/h) revealed that sharing the office space with a symptomatic COVID-19 infector (4 coughs and 10 speaking events per hour) for one hour resulted in the inhalation of 16.9 (25-75th range = 8.1-33.9) aerosolised respiratory droplets, equating to about 280-1190 particles inhaled over a 35-hour working week. Sharing with an asymptomatic infector (10 speaking events per hour) resulted in the about 196-875 particles inhaled over 35 hours.

    > Conclusions
      Given that live SARS-CoV-2 virions are known to be shed in high concentrations from the nasal cavity of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the results suggest that those sharing enclosed spaces with infectors for long periods may be at risk of contracting COVID-19 by the aerosol route, even when practicing social distancing.

    > Findings
      Of 601 samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 samples (10%) from case-cabins from which they left 1-17 days before sampling, but not from non-case-cabins. Except for one sample from an air hood in a corridor, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from samples in common areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from all 14 air samples.

    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by risk of nosocomial transmission; however, the extent of environmental contamination and its potential contribution of environmental contamination to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

    >  Methods
      Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

    > Results
      Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P < .05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and intensive care unit, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P = .238). The top 5 sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%).

    > Conclusions
      Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission. These results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices and enhanced hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.

      Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have long been used worldwide as frontline drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of human malaria. Since the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, humans have been under threat from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), subsequently declared a pandemic. While the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only preventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic against COVID-19. Based on accumulating scientific reports, here we highlight the possible modes of action of CQ/HCQ that could justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of repurposing old drugs, e.g. CQ/HCQ, particularly HCQ, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a good choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, including alteration of the acidic environment inside lysosomes and late endosomes, preventing endocytosis, exosome release and phagolysosomal fusion, and inhibition of the host cytokine storm. One or more diverse mechanisms might work against viral infections and reduce mortality. As there is no cure for COVID-19, clinical testing of HCQ is urgently required to determine its potency against SARS-CoV-2, as this is the currently available treatment option. There remains a need to find other innovative drug candidates as possible candidates to enter clinical evaluation and testing.

    head = HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZI) showed benefits in viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and a reduction in progression rate. However, the use of HCQ was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.

    > Backgrounds
      Since COVID-19 outbreak, various agents have been tested but no proven effective therapies have been identified. This has led to a lot of controversies among associated researches. Hence, in order to address the issue of using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
    > Methods
      A thorough search was carried out to find relevant studies in MEDLINE, medRxiv, PubMed, Cochrane Database, China Academic Journals Full-text Database and Web of Science. Two investigators independently reviewed 274 abstracts and 23 articles. The trials which evaluated HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 were included for this systematic review. Two investigators assessed quality of the studies and data extraction was done by one reviewer and cross checked by the other.
    > Results
      Five trials involving 677 patients were included while conducting the meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZI) showed benefits in viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95% CI 0.19-19.73) and a reduction in progression rate (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58-1.37), but without demonstrating any statistical significance. This systematic review has also suggested a possible synergistic effect of the combination therapy which included HCQ and AZI. However, the use of HCQ was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.
    > Conclusions
      The use of HCQ with or without AZI for treatment of COVID-19 patients, seems to be effective. The combination of HCQ and AZI has shown synergistic effects. However, mortality rate was increased when the treatment was conducted with HCQ.

    head = While no benefit on viral clearance demonstrated by HCQ compared to the control in patients with COVID-19, a significant 2-fold increase in mortality with the HCQ warrants its use.

    > Backgrounds and aims
      The role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19 is not fully known. We studied the efficacy of HCQ compared to the control in COVID-19 subjects on - a. viral clearance measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and, b. death due to all cause.

    > Methods
      PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and MedRxiv database were searched using the specific keywords up to April 30, 2020. Studies that met our objectives were assessed for the risk of bias applying various tools as indicated. Three studies each that reported the outcome of viral clearance by RT-PCR and death due to all cause, were meta-analyzed by applying inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic risk ratio (RR) using a random effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I2 statistic and funnel plots, respectively.

    > Results
      Meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 210) on viral clearance assessed by RT-PCR showed no benefit (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.38; p = 0.74), although with a moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 61.7%, p = 0.07). While meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 474) showed a significant increase in death with HCQ, compared to the control (RR, 2.17; 95% 1.32 to 3.57; p = 0.002), without any heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.43).

    > Conclusions
      No benefit on viral clearance but a significant increase in mortality was observed with HCQ compared to control in patients with COVID-19.

    > Objectives
      To assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus standard-of-care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in adult patients with COVID-19. Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone.

    > Interventions
      HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively).
    > Main outcome measures
      The primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone.
    > Results
      Among 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days (±standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 (±10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events.
    > Conclusions
      The administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients.

  ref 'Mahévas_et_al_05_14_2020
    head = 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine. The results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.

    > Objective:
      To assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pneumonia who require oxygen.

    > Design:
      Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care.

    > Setting:
      Four French tertiary care centres providing care to patients with covid-19 pneumonia between 12 March and 31 March 2020.

    > Participants:
      181 patients aged 18-80 years with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia who required oxygen but not intensive care.

    > Interventions:
      Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group).

    > Main outcome measures:
      The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21). Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

    > Results:
      In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group). Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission. In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1). Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3). Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6). At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment.

    > Conclusions:
      Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies. However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.

    head = Our studies should encourage further efforts in developing either pan-serine protease inhibitors or inhibitor cocktails to target SARS-CoV2 and potentially ward off future pandemics that could develop because of additional mutations in the S-protein priming sequence in coronaviruses.

    > Abstract
      Processing of certain viral proteins and bacterial toxins by host serine proteases is a frequent and critical step in virulence. The coronavirus spike glycoprotein contains three (S1, S2, and S2′) cleavage sites that are processed by human host proteases. The exact nature of these cleavage sites, and their respective processing proteases, can determine whether the virus can cross species and the level of pathogenicity. Recent comparisons of the genomes of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV, with less pathogenic strains (e.g., Bat-RaTG13, the bat homologue of SARS-CoV2) identified possible mutations in the receptor binding domain and in the S1 and S2′ cleavage sites of their spike glycoprotein. However, there remains some confusion on the relative roles of the possible serine proteases involved for priming. Using anthrax toxin as a model system, we show that in vivo inhibition of priming by pan-active serine protease inhibitors can be effective at suppressing toxicity. Hence, our studies should encourage further efforts in developing either pan-serine protease inhibitors or inhibitor cocktails to target SARS-CoV2 and potentially ward off future pandemics that could develop because of additional mutations in the S-protein priming sequence in coronaviruses.

While cleavage preferences of TMPRSS2 and other TMPRs are less defined compared to furin, their common consensus motifs follow the order R↓K > R↓R >> R↓X.

However, furin is also present intracellularly and may contribute to cleaving the S1 site at the viral egress. This could contribute to the delivery of already pre-primed viral particles that could then more readily infect other cells and organs and/or spread more easily from host to host.

Given that hPC1/3 and furin share similar cleavage preferences, it may be advantageous, if not necessary, for any inhibitor to target both human proteases.

    > Abstract
      Molecular mimicry is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to exploit the host cellular machinery. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in the striking mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (ENaC-α). Genetic alteration of ENaC-α causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting that the FURIN site is critical for activation of ENaC. Single cell RNA-seq from 66 studies shows significant overlap between expression of ENaC-α and the viral receptor ACE2 in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular characterization with cleavage signatures of 178 proteases highlights proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-α, a protein critical for the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, whose misregulation is associated with respiratory conditions.

    > Summary
      The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

Thus, the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S is required for cell-cell fusion, and this process can be augmented by adding basic residues to the S1/S2 site.

In contrast, entry into TMPRSS2− Vero cells, which is known to be cathepsin B/L dependent, was not affected by these mutations.

Finally, alterations of the S1/S2 site of SARS-S did not augment entry efficiency. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a multibasic S1/S2 site is essential for SARS-2-S-driven entry into human lung cells while a monobasic site is sufficient for SARS-S.

    head = By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions.

    > Summary
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence of widespread sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.

Our SARS-CoV-2 genome CT-Yale-001 clusters closely with other viruses sequenced from Asia (China), whereas the close genetic relatedness of genomes from Europe and Washington state in the clade that contains CT-Yale-006 makes it difficult to track the origins of this virus. Regardless, neither the CT-Yale-001 nor the CT-Yale-006 COVID-19 cases were travel-associated, which indicates that these patients were part of domestic transmission chains that stemmed from undetected introductions.

Although we did find a dramatic decrease in international importation risk following the restrictions on travel from Europe (March 13), this decrease occurred after our estimates of domestic travel importation risk had already surpassed that of international importation

We do not believe that Connecticut is more closely connected to its neighbors than states in other regions of the country. Therefore, our risk estimates indicate that this interconnectedness will perpetuate the domestic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that domestic spread will likely become the primary source of new infections in the United States.

    head = Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic than to early-to mid epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources.

    > Abstract
      In a side-by-side comparison of evolutionary dynamics between the 2019/2020 SARS-CoV-2 and the 2003 SARS-CoV, we were surprised to find that SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in the late phase of the 2003 epidemic after SARS-CoV had developed several advantageous adaptations for human transmission. Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.

A considerable portion of SARS-CoV-2 cases are asymptomatic or mild, leading to an underestimation of the virus population size.

    > Abstract
      We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein amino acid sequence extracted from 11,542 viral genomic sequences submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database through April 27, 2020. Consistent with prior reports, we found a major S protein mutation, D614 to G614, that was represented in 56% of all the analyzed sequences. All other mutations combined were less than 10%. After parsing the data geographically, we found most of the Chinese patient samples showed D614 (97%). By contrast, most patient samples in many European countries showed G614 (51 to 88%). In the United States, the genotypic distribution in California and Washington was similar to Asian countries, while the distribution in other US states was comparable to Europe. We observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of G614 over time in multiple regions, surpassing D614 when both were present, suggesting G614 S protein virus outcompetes D614 S protein virus. To gain insight into the consequences of the D614G mutation, homology modeling using a multi-template threading mechanism with ab initio structural refinement was performed for a region of the S protein (S591 to N710) spanning the D614G mutation and the S1 furin cleavage site. Molecular models of this region containing D614 or G614 revealed a major difference in secondary structure at the furin domain (RRARS, R682 to S686). The D614 model predicted a random coil structure in the furin domain whereas the G614 model predicted an alpha helix. Critical residues in the cleavage domain of G614 model were found to better align with the PDB structure of a furin inhibitor. Thus, homology modeling studies suggest a potential mechanism whereby the D614G mutation may confer a competitive advantage at the furin binding domain that may contribute to the rise of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 mutant.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 µM) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.

  // A Novel Bat Coronavirus Closely Related to SARS-CoV-2 Contains Natural Insertions at the S1/S2 Cleavage Site of the Spike Protein

    head = We report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified in Rhinolophus malayanus is the closest relative of SARSCoV-2 in the long 1ab replicase gene, although the virus itself has a complex history of recombination. The observation that RmYN02 contains an insertion of multiple amino acids at the S1/S2 cleavage site in the spike protein clearly indicates that events of this kind are a natural and expected component of coronavirus evolution.

    > Summary
      The unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China and beyond has had major public health impacts on a global scale. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomic analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses.

It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions, including RmYN02, ZXC21, and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor.

Indeed, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus showed highly structural homology with SARS-CoV-2.

Such an evolutionary pattern is indicative of a complex combination of recombination and natural selection.

    quote !h = Notably, SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a four-amino-acid insertion at the junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs. This insertion, which represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and is present in all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in RmYN02 is therefore of major importance. Although the inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats) strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely been acquired by recombination. As such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.

The pangolin beta-CoVs formed two well-supported sub-lineages, representing animal seized by anti-smuggling authorities in Guangxi (pangolin-CoV/GX) and Guangdong (pangolin-CoV/GD) provinces. However, whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these viruses, or they acquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife, requires further sampling.

Notably, RaTG13 was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, but feasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can utilize cave environments.

  ref 'Lau_et_al_05_04_2020
    head = We found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants.

    > Abstract
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and more than one million infections since December 2019. The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.

  // Pangolins Lack IFIH1/MDA5, a Cytoplasmic RNA Sensor That Initiates Innate Immune Defense Upon Coronavirus Infection
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00939
  ref 'Fischer_et_al_05_08_2020
    head = Pangolins are another group of mammals with evolutionarily downregulated defense against a subset of viruses, namely those sensed by IFIH1/MDA5 or ZBP1 in other species. The loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of infections by certain RNA viruses, including coronaviruses in pangolins.

    > Abstract
      Zoonotic infections are an imminent threat to human health. Pangolins were recently identified as carriers and intermediate hosts of coronaviruses. Previous research has shown that infection with coronaviruses activates an innate immune response upon sensing of viral RNA by interferon-induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), also known as MDA5. Here, we performed a comparative genomics study of RNA sensor genes in three species of pangolins. DDX58/RIG-I, a sensor of cytoplasmic viral RNA and toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 8, which bind RNA in endosomes, are conserved in pangolins. By contrast, IFIH1 a sensor of intracellular double-stranded RNA, has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins. Likewise, Z-DNA-binding protein (ZBP1), which senses both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, has been lost during the evolution of pangolins. These results suggest that the innate immune response to viruses differs significantly between pangolins and other mammals, including humans. We put forward the hypothesis that loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins.

DDX58 contains in-frame stop codons and frameshift mutations in the tree pangolin (M. tricuspis) but not in the Chinese pangolin (M. pentadactyla), suggesting that the tree pangolin lacks functional DDX58/RIG-I in addition to the two intracellular RNA sensors (IFIH1 and ZBP1) absent in all pangolins.

    # quote !d = We screened the genomes of mammals from diverse phylogenetic lineages for functional copies of ZBP1, IFIH1 and other RNA sensor genes. Mapping the presence or absence of these genes onto the phylogenetic tree suggested that loss of both ZBP1 and IFIH1 occurred in the pangolin lineages soon after divergence from the lineage leading to Carnivora (represented by cat, dog and bear). Other genes implicated in anti-RNA-viral defense are conserved in the selected set of species.

    quote !e = While genetic suppression of IFIH1/MDA5 and ZBP1-dependent pathways had neutral or beneficial effects in the evolution of pangolins, pharmaceutical suppression of IFIH1/MDA5 and ZBP1-dependent signaling may be beneficial for human patients with overreactions to viral nucleic acids.

There is a high sequence identity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2. However, phylogenetic analyses and a special amino acid sequence in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 did not support the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 arising directly from the pangolin-CoV-2020.

    > Abstract
      The outbreak of a novel corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 1.7 million laboratory confirmed cases all over the world. Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 was likely originated from bats, but its intermediate hosts are still largely unknown. In this study, we assembled the complete genome of a coronavirus identified in 3 sick Malayan pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that this pangolin coronavirus (pangolin-CoV-2020) is genetically related to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as a group of bat coronaviruses but do not support the SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from the pangolin-CoV-2020. Our study suggests that pangolins are natural hosts of Betacoronaviruses. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. In addition to conservation of wildlife, minimizing the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to reduce the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.

    > Abstract
      Viral infections during pregnancy can have devastating consequences on pregnancy outcomes, fetal development, and maternal health. In this review, we examine fetal and maternal immune defense mechanisms that mediate resistance against viral infections and discuss the range of syndromes that ensue when such mechanisms fail, from fetal developmental defects to establishment of chronic infection. Further, we highlight the role of maternal immune activation, or uncontrolled inflammation triggered by viral infections during pregnancy, and its potential downstream pathological effects, including tissue damage and fetal demise. Insights into the respective contributions of direct viral toxicity versus fetal and maternal immune responses that underlie the pathogenesis of congenital disease will guide future treatment strategies.

    > Abstract
      The outbreak of COVID-19 started in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world. In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFluTM database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau (τ) using the formula t=τ/2u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019. Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.

Due to the mild symptoms and low mortality, the immune systems of the infected humans may provide a suitable environment for propagation of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is able to infect humans not only through the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but also use the mucous membranes in the eyes which may boost regional circulation and large-scale spread.

Of 22 genomes (17.05% of 129 patients) sequenced before 06 January 2020 in Wuhan, China, 13 haplotypes (22.41% of 58 haplotypes) were recovered, which were H1 and its derived descendant haplotypes, and H3.

This earlier population expansion time was estimated at 28.38 days before 05 January 2020, which was the latest sampling date of the 22 genomes. This earlier expansion date was thus estimated to have occurred on 08 December 2019, when there was only one infected patient officially reported. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might have already circulated widely among humans in Wuhan before December 2019, probably beginning in mid to late November.

The rooted network suggested two potential evolutionary paths of available haplotypes that can be from H13 through H3 to H1 and H38, or from H38 through H3 to H1 and H13. Both scenarios suggested that H3 might be the ancestral haplotype of H1.

Genetically, haplotypes of Group A have links to only Wuhan haplotype H3 (only EPI_ISL_406801). It is possible that H13 was newly derived from H3 and did not spread in Wuhan, or that three repatriated Japanese might be infected by an unknown source of H13 in Wuhan, China or somewhere else, or that no samples have been sequenced yet.

Three haplotypes (H14, H15, and H17) may have evolved locally, indicating that human-to-human transmissions happened when SARS-CoV-2 initially spread to Shenzhen in Guangdong Province. Two samples from Taiwan Province, China, encoded H3 and H24 in Groups B and D, respectively, and three samples from Chongqing encoded H1, H40, and H45 in Groups B and C, respectively. There were two sources imported into these two provinces. Four Zhejiang samples encoded H1 and H24 in Group C, which might be only imported from the source of the H1 haplotype.

Six haplotypes linked to H1, and two each linked to H3 and H1, respectively, indicating the 12 patients were infected by different sources. Human-to-human transmissions may have happened from patients with H53 to H52 haplotypes in Tokyo, Japan. Five Australian samples, encoding six haplotypes in Groups B, C, and D, were from patients of three states. Patients with H3, H25 and H26, and with H55 were in Groups B and C, respectively, and human-to-human transmission might have happened from the patients with H25 to H26, who were in a same tour group in Queensland. The connection between the patients with H56 and H27 is not clear. One possibility is that there was an intermediary spreader with H56, who also transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to other patients in France, the United States, and Taiwan Province of China. 18 European samples, encoding 7 haplotypes, were from patients in 4 countries.

    # quote !aa = The patients in England were reported as a household transmission from H28 to H29. The patients in France may have been infected by three different sources, i.e., H44 was linked to H1, H43 might link to H40 (in Chongqing, Singapore or somewhere else), and H30 might link to an intermediary spreader with H56. Of the 13 genomes from the United States, three were from the same patient in Washington encoding the same haplotype H38, while the other ten samples encoded eight haplotypes, covering all five groups, so the sources of infections are complicated. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the United States from these 11 cases. To clarify the exact origins of these haplotypes outside China, we need more epidemiological investigative efforts and more SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from patients at the early stage of transmissions.

The most common ancestral haplotype was missed because the currently available samples do not include the first identified infected patient and other patients from early December, and because of the relatively high mutation rate of the viral genome. If there are any frozen samples from those patients, it would be worth doing genomic sequencing for phyloepidemiologic study to help to locate the birthplace of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, we expect that the H13 and H38 haplotypes might be found in some samples from infected patients in Wuhan or in other places across the world if more samples are sequenced in future.

This approach has recovered potentially specific directions of human-to-human transmission in the Shenzhen family (H13 → H14), the Queensland tour group (H25 → H26), the England family (H28 → H29), and the Japanese (H53 → H52).

    quote !ae = Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 has not had legitimate recombination. Thus, the haplotype-based phyloepidemiologic analyses provide a powerful way to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the very early stage of transmission when reverse mutations and illegitimate recombination are rare. In our analysis, recombination is rejected but the outgroup bat-RaTG13-CoV is relatively highly diverged from SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, which may affect the phyloepidemiologic analyses.

    # quote !af = Based on the estimated mutation rate of current SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the reverse mutations should be 6×10−3 (0.92×10−3×0.92×10−3 per site per year×29 358 sites×2/12 year), with a neglectable influence on our result. But our observations leave one important question: why are ancestral haplotypes, like H13 and H38, less frequent than H1? It is highly possible that H1 acquired adaptive mutations, such as NS of site 28151, from H3 or H13 (and/or H38), evolved in an independent circulation after they jumped into intermediate hosts or directly transmitted to humans, which should be investigated in future studies if more early genome datasets are available. The exact original sources of H13 and H38 will stay as unsolved mysteries if the early stage samples were not preserved.

      We provide research findings on the physics of aerosol and droplet dispersion relevant to the hypothesized aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets () allows lingering in the air for ) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes , into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. . By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols () over distances  in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, ’exposure time’ to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional ’safety distance’ thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale  aerosols could range from to or even to  depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abd0110
  ref 'Roschewski_et_al_05_06_2020
    head = This prospective study of patients with severe COVID-19 highlights the potential benefit of BTK inhibition and has led to a confirmatory international prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Given the activation of BTK and production of IL-6 that we detected in COVID-19 monocytes, we propose that BTK inhibitors target pathological monocyte/macrophage activation and dampen the cytokine storm, which consequently may improve outcomes in these patients.  More broadly, our findings raise the prospect that the morbidity of other disease states associated with macrophage activation, including severe influenza infections, may similarly depend on BTK function, supporting clinical trial evaluation of BTK inhibitors in these clinical settings as well.

    > Abstract
      Patients with severe COVID-19 have a hyperinflammatory immune response suggestive of macrophage activation. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) regulates macrophage signaling and activation. Acalabrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor, was administered off label to 19 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (11 on supplemental oxygen and 8 on mechanical ventilation), 18 of whom had increasing oxygen requirements at baseline. Over a 10- to 14-day treatment course, initiation of acalabrutinib treatment was associated with improved oxygenation in a majority of patients, often within 1 to 3 days, and had no discernable toxicity. Measures of inflammation—C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6)—normalized quickly in most patients, as did lymphopenia, in correlation with improved oxygenation. At the end of acalabrutinib treatment, 8 of 11 (72.7%) patients in the supplemental oxygen cohort had been discharged on room air, and 4 of 8 (50%) patients in the mechanical ventilation cohort had been successfully extubated, with 2 of 8 (25%) discharged on room air. Ex vivo analysis revealed significantly elevated BTK activity, as evidenced by autophosphorylation, and increased IL-6 production in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19 compared with blood monocytes from healthy volunteers. These results suggest that targeting excessive host inflammation with a BTK inhibitor is a therapeutic strategy in severe COVID-19 and has led to a confirmatory international prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.

We prospectively administered acalabrutinib off-label with therapeutic intent to 19 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, based on the known role of BTK in innate immune cells. All but one patient had increasing oxygen requirements at the time of treatment initiation, and all but four patients were on high-flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation, indicating the severity of the disease in this series.

Although the patients on mechanical ventilation had a more variable clinical response to acalabrutinib, improved oxygenation in half of these patients allowed them to be extubated. Our laboratory studies of ex vivo blood samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 revealed significantly elevated BTK phosphorylation in peripheral blood monocytes compared with healthy volunteers, demonstrating that the target of acalabrutinib is activated in these innate immune cells.

    quote !b = This finding supports our view that the apparent beneficial effect of acalabrutinib in these patients was due to on-target inhibition of BTK. More generally, this study highlights the opportunity to improve outcomes in severe COVID-19 by modulating the host inflammatory response.

    head = Here, we showed that a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is effective in preventing damage to the lungs upon high dose challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Similarly a recent study showed that a triple vaccination regime of a high dose of whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines are an essential countermeasure urgently needed to control the pandemic. Here, we show that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was not Th2 dominated, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine expression profiling. A single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced a humoral and cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated rhesus macaques. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is currently under investigation in a phase I clinical trial. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomised controlled human clinical trials.
      We previously demonstrated that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS, a chimpanzee adeno (ChAd)-vectored vaccine platform encoding the spike protein of MERS-CoV, protected non-human primates (NHPs) against MERS-CoV-induced disease. Here, we designed a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine encoding a codon-optimised full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009724390.1) with a human tPA leader sequence, provisionally named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, similar to the approach for ChAdOx1 MERS5.

    quote !a = Viral loads in BAL fluid and lung tissue of vaccinated animals were significantly reduced, suggesting that vaccination prevents virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. Despite this marked difference in virus replication in the lungs, reduction in viral shedding from the nose was not observed. However, animals were challenged with a high dose of virus via multiple routes, which likely does not reflect a realistic human exposure. Whether a lower challenge dose would result in more efficient protection of the upper respiratory tract remains to be determined.

    head = Corticosteroid use in subjects with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections delayed virus clearing and did not convincingly improve survival, reduce hospitalization duration or ICU admission rate and/or use of mechanical ventilation. There were several adverse effects. Because of a preponderance of observational studies in the dataset and selection and publication biases our conclusions, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, need confirmation in randomized clinical trials.

    > Abstract
      We performed a meta-analysis to determine safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, WanFang Chinese database, and ZhiWang Chinese database using Boolean operators and search terms covering SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, OR MERS-CoV AND corticosteroids to find appropriate studies. Review Manager 5.3 was used to analyze results of meta-analysis. Observational studies were analyzed for quality using the modified Newcastle–Ottawa scale and randomized clinical trials, using the Jadad scale. Subjects were divided into those with severe-only and other (severe and not severe) cohorts based on published criteria. Efficacy endpoints studied included mortality, hospitalization duration, rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and a composite endpoint (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation). We included 11 reports including 10 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial involving 5249 subjects (2003–2020). Two discussed the association of corticosteroids and virus clearing and 10 explored how corticosteroids impacted mortality, hospitalization duration, use of mechanical ventilation, and a composite endpoint. Corticosteroid use was associated with delayed virus clearing with a mean difference (MD) = 3.78 days (95% confidence Interval [CI] = 1.16, 6.41 days; I2 = 0%). There was no significant reduction in deaths with relative Risk Ratio (RR) = 1.07 (90% CI = 0.81; 1.42; I2 = 80%). Hospitalization duration was prolonged and use of mechanical ventilation increased. In conclusion, corticosteroid use in subjects with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections delayed virus clearing and did not convincingly improve survival, reduce hospitalization duration or ICU admission rate and/or use of mechanical ventilation. There were several adverse effects. Because of a preponderance of observational studies in the dataset and selection and publication biases our conclusions, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, need confirmation in a randomized clinical trial. In the interim we suggest caution using corticosteroids in persons with COVID-19.

Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both cytopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 and immunopathologic damage. Strategies that prohibit pulmonary recruitment and overactivation of inflammatory cells by suppressing cytokine storm might improve the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19.

    > BACKGROUND
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic. This study addresses the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19.

    > METHODS
      Sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe and nonsevere groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics. A panel of blood cytokines was quantified over time. Biopsy specimens from 2 deceased cases were obtained for immunopathological, ultrastructural, and in situ hybridization examinations.

    > RESULTS
      Circulating cytokines, including IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Dynamic IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II and type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis. In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions. Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both cytopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 and immunopathologic damage. Strategies that prohibit pulmonary recruitment and overactivation of inflammatory cells by suppressing cytokine storm might improve the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19.

The underlying mechanisms of cytokine storm and lung damage involved the exhaustion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, followed by massive infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into lung tissues, causing the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

    quote !b = Clinically, 3 criteria, the PaO2/FIO2 ratio, SpO2, and RR are often used to define patients with severe COVID-19. In our cohort, because 96% of severe patients had a SpO2 value ≤93% at rest, it seems that SpO2 is the most useful indicator for defining disease severity. Old age and severe symptoms of myalgia, fatigue, and dyspnea were the most common features of severe patients, as described in earlier reports. Lymphopenia is a common feature with drastically reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells. Reduced percentages of monocytes and eosinophils are also common.

    / May, 2020 - JCI Insight
    quote !c = An increase in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio usually indicates increased disease severity and a poor clinical outcome. In our cohort, dynamic tests in severe patients found lymphopenia with a remarkable decrease of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and neutrophilia as well as a sustained increase in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio that reached a peak on 7 day after admission, suggesting that physicians should monitor these dynamic characteristics in severe patients. The dramatic reduction in lymphocytes in severe patients might be caused by both overexuberant immune responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection of T lymphocytes.

    quote !d = Neutrophilia in COVID-19 severity might be ascribed to abnormal elevated IL-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In our study, the substantial neutrophil infiltrate in lung tissues from the 2 deceased cases was assumed to indicate the possible role of neutrophilia in disease severity. In addition, some variables were identified to be associated with COVID-19 severity.

Additionally, increased levels of ferritin and glucose and decreased levels of albumin and Apo-A1 were found to correlate with COVID-19 severity, implying that severe patients were prone to metabolic disorders due to impaired liver function. However, we still lack conclusive evidence to support metabolic dysregulation by SARS-CoV-2 per se.

    quote !f = Most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited substantially elevated serum levels of several cytokines, which can even manifest as cytokine storm (14). Consistently, our results showed that patients with severe COVID-19 had an overexuberant response of a panel of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, compared with nonsevere patients. These inflammatory factors are mainly derived from macrophages and neutrophils, which could be predictors of hypercytokinemia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

    quote !g = We found that the dynamics of serum IL-6 showed a rapid increase, with a peak level on day 5 of hospitalization, on average, whereas serum IL-8 maintained a high level until day 5 of hospitalization in severe patients. The dynamic trends were highly consistent with disease deterioration. Indeed, in this cohort, systemic corticosteroids, which might contribute to the interference of elevated IL-6 and IL-8 levels, were administered to the most severe patients. Based on the pathological findings of massive recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils to lung tissues, we speculated that the infiltrating inflammatory cells triggered or exacerbated inflammation and exudation, even ARDS in targeted lung, resulting in a vicious circle of cytokine release that led to cytokine storm.

    / May, 2020 - JCI Insight
    quote !h = The development of targeted therapeutics against cytokine storm is still a clinical issue. In our study, a panel of cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, IP10, TNF-α, MCP1, and RANTES, was profoundly elevated in severe patients during disease deterioration. Therefore, cytokine neutralization therapy is likely to be an alternative option.

    quote !i =  In this study, we demonstrated type II and type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells with conspicuous cytopathy in lung tissues were infected with SARS-CoV-2 by both TEM and in situ hybridization. Reactive hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes in DAD alveolar spaces in turn might facilitate virus infection and spreading due to high expression of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2. SARS-CoV-2 infection in endothelial cells in small vessels might contribute to vasculitis, even thrombosis, which was assumed to be related to increased blood D-dimer and fibrinogen levels in disease exacerbation. Thus, severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 was considered to result from both direct viral infection and immunopathological injury.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS CoV‐2) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. Coronaviruses enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after virion endocytosis. The spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity. Herein, we show that the transient expression of the SARS CoV‐2 S glycoprotein in Vero cells caused extensive cell fusion (formation of syncytia) in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S glycoprotein. Both S glycoproteins were detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytia formation in lung tissues of patients with COVID‐19. These results suggest that SARS CoV‐2 is able to spread from cell‐to‐cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry revealed that only the FDA‐approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S‐n‐ and S‐o‐mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10‐μM concentration. In‐silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S‐n‐ and S‐o‐mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV‐2 symptoms appear.

      Viral pandemics, such as the one caused by SARS-CoV-2, pose an imminent threat to humanity. Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we offer an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6.

Taken together, these data suggest that, at low MOIs, the virus is not a strong inducer of the IFN-I and -III system, as opposed to conditions where the MOI is high. These dynamics are also likely to contribute to development of COVID-19 during the course of infection

    quote !e = We found, in all of our systems, significant induction of monocyte-associated chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL8. In addition, our data suggest that neutrophils could also contribute to the disease observed in COVID-19 patients, as demonstrated by CXCL2 and CXCL8 induction. This is consistent with data showing elevated circulating neutrophil levels among COVID-19 patients, which may have prognostic value for identifying individuals at risk for developing severe disease. It is also noteworthy that two of the cytokines uniquely elevated in response to SARS-CoV-2 are IL-6 and IL1RA, suggesting that there might be a parallel between COVID-19 and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a complication commonly seen following CAR T-cell treatment.Should this be true, drugs such as tocilizumab and anakinra may prove to be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19. Future studies will be needed to address this formally.

    quote !f = Based on animal models, SARS-CoV-1 has been found to induce a robust cytokine response that generally shows a delay in IFN-I, culminating in improper recruitment of inflammatory monocyte-macrophage populations. This dynamic seems to be in line with what we observed with SARS-CoV-2 because low levels of IFN-I and -III are likely produced in response to infection. Given the moderate viral replication levels observed in vivo, one explanation for the low IFN expression could be that a small subset of cells is refractory to the antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, producing sufficient amounts of IFN-I and/or IFN-III to guide immune cell activation and ISG induction.

    > Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 200,000 deaths worldwide. Several studies have now established that the hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV. Here we describe the potentially pathological roles of macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss ongoing and prospective therapeutic strategies to modulate macrophage activation in patients with COVID-19.

The systemic cytokine profiles observed in patients with severe COVID-19 show similarities to those observed in cytokine release syndromes, such as macrophage activation syndrome, with increased production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-7 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and also of inflammatory chemokines including CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3 and CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), as well as of the soluble form of the α-chain of the IL-2 receptor.

Although it is possible that the reduced levels of circulating T cells in patients may reflect their massive recruitment to inflamed tissues or the use of steroid treatment to mitigate inflammation, some studies have reported significant T cell depletion from the secondary lymphoid organs of patients infected with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

Accordingly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of BALF collected from patients with severe or mild COVID-19 revealed increased proportions of MNPs, with these cells accounting for as much as 80% of total BALF cells in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with only approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of total BALF cells in patients with mild disease or healthy controls.

Inflammatory programmes seen in these macrophages24 were consistent with findings from bulk RNA-seq analysis of BALF23 from patients with severe COVID-19, and notably both studies identified a strong interferon gene signature. In addition, a subset of macrophages has been described in patients with COVID-19 that is enriched in genes associated with tissue repair and promotes fibrosis generation, such as is seen in liver cirrhosis.

However, in contrast to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, low levels of IL-10 and high levels of IL-1β were often detected in SARS-CoV. Of note, while infection of MNPs is abortive in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can replicate in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells4.

Potential mechanisms include high rates of viral replication, which could be responsible for enhanced host cell cytolysis and the strong production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by infected epithelial cells; delayed induction of antiviral interferon responses owing to virus escape mechanisms, such as production of interferon inhibitory proteins, which perpetuates virual damage, leading to excessive accumulation of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs4; or modulation of the ACE2-mediated epithelial protective pathway upon virus binding to its receptors.

Interestingly, however, deletion of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 receptor adaptor MYD88 had no effect on mouse ALI; in fact, a protective role of MYD88 was even reported, although protection was independent of IL-1 receptor engagement by IL-1β43. These experiments were conducted in mice with constitutive MYD88 deficiency and do not rule out a pathological function for MYD88-dependent TLR and IL-1β-mediated signalling in late stages of the disease. However, the temporal contribution of inflammasome-induced IL-1β to viral clearance and/or COVID-19 severity remains to be investigated.

Microthrombi of the lungs, lower limbs, hands, brain, heart, liver and kidneys have been described in patients with COVID-19. Notably, activation of coagulation and intravascular coagulation is a hallmark of organ injury in sepsis, where it is mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !u = The initiation of inflammation-induced coagulation leading to an increased coagulation state is almost always mediated by the expression of the tissue factor (TF; also called CD142 or coagulation factor III) pathway. In addition, major natural anticoagulant pathways, such as antithrombin or TF pathway inhibitor, are almost always impaired during inflammation, contributing further to the propagation of coagulation. In the absence of vascular injury, the initiation of coagulation is completely dependent on the recruitment of TF-expressing inflammatory monocytes by activated endothelial cells.

    quote !v = It is also possible that oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) — which have been detected in the lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV38 — contribute to the process. OxPLs are produced following oxidative stress; they promote the induction of TF expression and inflammatory programmes in monocytes and activate endothelial cells to recruit and bind to monocytes. In experimental ALI, OxPLs trigger macrophage activation through the TLR4–TRIF–TRAF6–NF-κB pathway. Interfering with monocyte and/or endothelial cell activation in response to OxPLs could help prevent thrombotic complications, especially in patients with COVID-19 who have pre-existing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.

Circulating CD14+ monocytes require the chemokine receptor CCR2 to exit the bone marrow and to accumulate in inflamed tissues58,59. CCR2 blockade could potentially help to reduce the accumulation of pathological monocytes in inflamed tissues, although it is likely that redundant mechanisms independent of CCR2 may also contribute to monocyte accumulation in tissues during severe inflammation.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !aa = Type I interferon (IFNαβ) receptors are ubiquitously expressed and type I interferons can drive antiviral effects but also induce the activation of immune cells that could potentially enhance tissue pathology. By contrast, type III interferon (also known as IFNλ) mainly targets epithelial cells as well as a restricted pool of immune cells, and could therefore promote a potent antiviral effect without enhancing pathological tissue inflammation. Inflammatory macrophages from the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a strong interferon signature and it is possible that, while interferon may be protective during the early stages of the disease, persistent IFNγ production could ultimately drive macrophage hyperactivation as is seen in macrophage activation syndrome. Trials exploring IFNγ blockade in patients with COVID-19 who show respiratory distress and hyperinflammation have been initiated (NCT04324021).

    quote !bb = Current models of COVID-19 propose three distinct immune stages that are crucial for the ultimate disease course. In the first stage, early activation of the immune system through the induction of a potent interferon response is important to control the virus. In the second stage, a delayed interferon response may lead to progressive tissue damage. This may ultimately lead to the third stage, a deleterious hyperinflammation characterized by the excessive macrophage activation and coagulation that is seen in patients with severe disease, possibly followed by dysregulation of tissue repair mechanisms and fibrosis.

    head = Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR.

    > Abstract
      COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, resulting in nearly three hundred thousand deaths distributed heterogeneously across countries. Estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) has been elusive due to the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections and lack of testing capacity. We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries' reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR.

There is little to no correlation between these deviations and GDP or age, which are considered proxies of risk for mortality from COVID-19. Instead, deviations likely represent variation in testing and reporting strategies. Additional variation can occur because COVID-19 associated deaths lag diagnosis, so countries early in an epidemic may report a lower than expected CFR.

    quote !e = Given results of this work that indicate the risk of death to be approximately 1% from COVID-19, which is higher than the risk of death in the same 2-3 week interval from common chronic comorbidities, the probability that a SARS-COV-2 positive death could be attributed to COVID-19 is higher than the probability the death could be attributed to other chronic comorbidities. In an estimate of 0.1% probability of mortality in a 2 week window due to existing comorbidities, the probability that death of an infected patient with a pre-existing condition is primarily due to the existing condition is less than 10% (SI 6). In this case, the reported CFR needs to be adjusted to 90% of its value. In light of this, the vast majority of SARS-COV2 positive deaths are due in whole or primarily to COVID-19.

    quote !f = High reported CFR values are a result of under-counting of positive infections rather than overcounting COVID-19 associated deaths.

The methods provided in this work and the supplement are easy to translate to other studies when high quality data and independent samples are available. We hope this approach can be used to give updated estimates of the global IFR, as deaths due to infection often lag diagnosis.

    / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    quote !i = Reported CFR values for some countries in this study are low due to the nascency of viral transmission in the country in April 2020. As more data becomes available for infections and COVID-19 deaths, case fatality rates can be more reliably approximated, which can be translated to a global IFR. Temporal or regional variation in testing strategy affects the relationship between CFR and testing capacity, therefore cumulative data collected at least 1 month after the first recorded COVID-19 death in each country better represents the relationship than point estimates.

    quote !j =  Of note, some countries have yet to report deaths, and more have yet to report the number of tests administered, including China.

    head = This article discusses the use case for individual-level versus population-level serological testing, with a focus on IgG testing applications. We emphasize the dangers of using current serologic tests for individual-level risk assessments but highlight the potential power of deploying population-level serological testing (i.e., serosurveillance or seroepidemiology), even with assays of moderate sensitivity/specificity.

    > Abstract
      Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 has enormous potential to contribute to COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. However, the required performance characteristics of antibody tests will critically depend on the use case (individual level versus population level).

    quote !a = Serology tests with relatively high but imperfect specificity may lead to substantial false-positive results when used in low-incidence settings. For example, in a setting where 5% of the population has been infected, a test with 96% specificity and 90% sensitivity would lead to just 54% of positive results, indicating a true infection (i.e., positive predictive value).

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !b = In addition to the risks of false positives, false negatives may occur in some previously infected persons who fail to produce antibodies specific to the antigens/epitopes in a given assay, or whose antibodies have already quickly waned, or, when used during an on-going epidemic, among those who have not yet mounted a specific antibody response. For these individuals that do not mount a measurable antibody response despite having been infected, obtaining permission to return to work could be onerous. Further considerations that may undermine the individual use case is that even with a true-positive antibody result, we do not know how well that translates to protection or immunity nor whether those positive by an antibody test could still shed virus and infect others.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !c = At the population level, representative cross-sectional serosurveys can provide aggregate “snapshots” of infection history and immunity of a population. Understanding the proportion of the population infected by SARS-CoV-2 cannot be assessed on the basis of PCR-confirmed cases alone because of variations in testing practices, timing of sampling, and the clinical spectrum of disease (e.g., asymptomatic infections). In contrast to case data, seroepidemiological datasets provide a less biased picture of risk of death (infection fatality rate) and the amplitude of transmission in different populations and can highlight disparities in infection rates without typical health-seeking behavior biases.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !d = Understanding age-specific or spatial distribution of susceptibility could guide policymakers about where to intervene and to what degree, by helping to answer questions such as: What IgG seroprevalence in children is acceptable to allow schools to open? Do infection attack rates differ between children and adults? Population-level surveys could also help estimate the probability and timing of future waves of disease, which will critically depend upon duration of immunity, measure the impact of interventions such as physical distancing or vaccination, and, in later stages, confirm the absence of transmission.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !e = Optimal thresholds for sensitivity/specificity can be “tuned” depending on local prevalence and intended use of the assay. For example, when conducting a serosurvey in low-prevalence settings, to achieve better precision of point estimates of disease burden, the assay specificity should be prioritized, typically at the cost of sensitivity. This can be achieved by raising the cutoff value for the assay used, for example, by setting higher optical density readings as the threshold for positivity in an ELISA. Similarly, in a high-prevalence setting, test sensitivity should be prioritized at the cost of specificity. Thus, we recommend the consideration of multiple threshold values (cutoffs) for assays that can be flexibly used in different contexts.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !f = While many SARS-CoV-2 serological assays may have insufficient performance characteristics (sensitivity/specificity) to warrant use at the individual level and the World Health Organization currently recommends restricting antibody testing to research use only, we argue that these imperfect tests may nevertheless provide highly valuable tools to address critical public health questions, such as the safety of relaxing stay-at-home orders or school closures or evaluations of alternative intervention measures. To fully realize the benefits of population-level seroepidemiological studies, a number of fundamental questions must be addressed, relating to test performance, the dynamics of antibody responses in relation to infection, and the link between antibody responses and immunity.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !g = Serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 will only be capable of contributing to actionable public health information if serology measurements flow into efficient data pipelines. Scale-up of serological testing for pandemic response must therefore be accompanied by a governance model at the subnational, national, and international levels and by an operational research agenda that evaluates the utility of assays within specific contexts.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !h = National-level governance will be required to provide oversight for sample collection and processing and linkage to personal data and to coordinate results analysis to the appropriate scale for policy relevance. Much like a national census is translated into infrastructure appropriations, serosurveillance could be used for resource allocations (and future vaccination efforts) to target transmission hotspots.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !i = A host of ethical and privacy issues will need to be addressed; we suggest that serosurveillance platforms should incorporate broad consent, enabling future screening of serum collections for multiple biomarkers of public health concern beyond SARS-CoV-2 alone. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the value of transparency in disease surveillance for all nations. We see a role for international coordination of national seroepidemiology programs to facilitate standardizing methods and dissemination of results among national public health laboratories.

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !j = In summary, seroepidemiological studies and integrated serosurveillance platforms are urgently needed to guide and tailor SARS-CoV-2 response efforts and will continue to be critical for mitigating postpandemic resurgence. Coordinated serosurveillance provides opportunities to combine control efforts for different diseases into one coordinated program; this may be particularly valuable to assess impact of the COVID-19 crisis on routine immunization programs

    / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
    quote !k = Platforms should be designed with a longer term vision beyond COVID-19, to generate capacity for “precision public health” to monitor additional major diseases, and provide insights into how disease occurrence is interrelated with other health risk factors. Last, we stress that investing now in a fundamental and operational research agenda will allow us to rapidly develop serosurveillance as a powerful tool for population-level public health; however, the complexity of using serological assays within low-prevalence settings to inform individual-based risk assessments, i.e., to inform decisions regarding return to work, is dangerously premature

Accuracy is also likely to vary depending on stage of disease and degree of viral multiplication or clearance. Higher sensitivities are reported depending on which gene targets are used, and whether multiple gene tests are used in combination. Reported accuracies are much higher for in vitro studies, which measure performance of primers using coronavirus cell culture in carefully controlled conditions.

    quote !d = The lack of a clear-cut “gold-standard” is a challenge for evaluating covid-19 tests; pragmatically, clinical adjudication may be the best available “gold standard,” based on repeat swabs, history, and contact with patients known to have covid-19, chest radiographs, and computed tomography scans. Inevitably this introduces some incorporation bias, where the test being evaluated forms part of the reference standard, and this would tend to inflate the measured sensitivity of these tests. Disease prevalence can also affect estimates of accuracy: tests developed and evaluated in populations with high prevalence (eg, secondary care) may have lower sensitivity when applied in a lower prevalence setting (eg, primary care).

    quote !e = Sensitivity is the proportion of patients with disease who have a positive test, or the true positive rate. Specificity is the proportion of patients without disease who have a negative test, or true negative rate. These terms describe the operating characteristics of a test and can be used to gauge the credibility of a test result. They can be combined to calculate likelihood ratios, which are dimensionless numbers that indicate the strength of a positive or negative test result

    / May, 2020 - BMJ
    quote !f = For calculating probabilities, a likelihood ratio can be used as a multiplier to convert pre-test odds to post-test odds. Positive likelihood ratios greater than 1 are progressively stronger, with 10 representing a very strong positive test result. Negative likelihood ratios less than 1 are also progressively stronger, with 0.1 representing a very strong negative test result. In the case of the nasopharyngeal swab RNA test for covid-19, the positive likelihood ratio is about 14, which is excellent.6 A positive covid-19 test result should be very compelling. The negative likelihood ratio is 0.3, which is a moderate result, but not nearly as compelling as a positive result because of the moderate sensitivity (about 70%) of the covid-19 test.

    quote !g = Interpretation of a test result depends not only on the characteristics of the test itself but also on the pre-test probability of disease. Clinicians use a heuristic (a learned mental short cut) called anchoring and adjusting to settle on a pre-test probability (called the anchor). They then adjust this probability based on additional information. This heuristic is a useful short cut but comes with the potential for bias. When people fail to estimate the pre-test probability and only respond to a piece of new information, they commit a fallacy called base-rate neglect.

    quote !i = Clinician’s thinking about a patient’s probability should shift, based on either a positive or negative test result for covid-19. First, the clinician should estimate a pre-test probability, using knowledge of local rates of covid-19 infection from national and regional data and patients’ symptoms and signs, likelihood of alternative diagnoses, and history of exposure to covid=19. After choosing a pre-test probability on the x axis, one should then trace up to either the upper curve for a positive test result or the lower curve for a negative test result, then trace over to the y axis to read the estimate for post-test probability.

    / May, 2020 - BMJ
    quote !j = A single negative test result may not be informative if the pre-test probability is high. Pre-test probability is high in someone with typical symptoms of covid-19, an occupational risk of exposure, and working in a high prevalence region, and negative test results can therefore be misleading.

    / May, 2020 - BMJ
    quote !k = A possible alternative diagnosis will reduce the pre-test probability- This patient has an alternative possible diagnosis: community-acquired pneumonia. Given her lack of other risk factors or clinical symptoms, and chest radiography findings we therefore estimate her pre-test probability at about 50%. One negative test reduces this risk to 24%, the patient therefore has an additional independently sampled nasopharyngeal swab RNA test which was negative, giving a post-test probability after two negative tests of less than 10%. She is treated with antibiotics and continues to recover.

    quote !l = Clinicians should ensure that patients are counselled about the limitations of tests. Patients with a single negative test but strongly suggestive symptoms of covid-19 should be advised to self-isolate in keeping with guidelines for suspected covid-19.

    quote !m = Serology tests, which detect immunoglobulins including IgG and IgM, are under development, with the aim of detecting individuals who have had previous infection and therefore theoretically developed immunity. False positive serology tests could cause false reassurance, behaviour change, and disease spread. If suitable accuracy can be established, the benefits of these antibody tests include establishing when healthcare workers are immune, helping to inform decisions about the lifting of lockdowns, and allowing the population to return to work.



  # LINK IT WITH THIS PAPER: Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19, ACE inhibitors are extremely protective on vascular dysfunction. “Most of their benefit in the continuum of cardiovascular illness — be it high blood pressure, be it stroke, be it heart attack, be it arrhythmia, be it heart failure — in any situation the mechanism by which they protect the cardiovascular system starts with their ability to stabilize the endothelial cells. Existing drugs that can help protect against endothelial cell damage- Statins and ACE inhibitors were linked to higher rates of survival. Statins reduce the risk of heart attacks not only by lowering cholesterol or preventing plaque, they also stabilize existing plaque, meaning they’re less likely to rupture if someone is on the drugs.

    head = In this multinational observational study involving patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias) is independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. It is important to note that we were not able to confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital mortality in this clinical context. Our investigation also confirms previous reports of the independent relationship of older age, current smoking, and COPD with death in Covid-19. Our results also suggest that women are proportionately more likely than men to survive the infection. Neither harmful nor beneficial associations were noted for antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, or hypoglycemic therapy.

    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.

    > Methods
      Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.

    > Results
      Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those ≤65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).

    > Conclusions
      Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

    head = We present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients’ ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.

    > Abstract
      The severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) largely depends on a patient’s age. Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients’ ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.

    quote !a = The aging immune system: An abundance of recent data describing the pathology and molecular changes in COVID-19 patients points to both immunosenescence and inflammaging as major drivers of the high mortality rates in older patients. Within immunosenescence, there are defects in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Innate immunosenescence is characterized by ineffective pathogen recognition and macrophage activation, and a reduction in natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, whereas adaptive immunosenescence is characterized by thymic atrophy and accumulation of anergic memory lymphocytes. In both cases, these age-related changes are thought to be due to pathogenic, genetic, and lifestyle factors that affect the cells’ epigenetic status and the diversity of immune cells.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !b = The aging innate immune system: The inability of Alveolar macrophages (AMs) in older individuals to recognize viral particles and convert to a pro-inflammatory state likely accelerates COVID-19 in its early stages, whereas in its advanced stages, AMs are likely to be responsible for the excessive lung damage. A recent study comparing immune cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients showed in severe cases, macrophages were phenotypically more proinflammatory, expressing higher levels of CCR1 and CXCR2 that recruit other innate immune cells, compared to macrophages from moderate COVID-19 cases that expressed more T-cell attracting chemokines. Prolonged monocyte activation is a well-known cause of severe lung injury in rhesus monkeys and in cases of SARS (caused by SARS-CoV-1), higher numbers of pulmonary neutrophils and macrophages correlated with the development of ARDS and greater lung damage.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !c =  A decline in neutrophil activity might also be partly responsible because, during aging, these cells progressively lose their ability to migrate to sites of infection and kill infected cells. NK cells, a major component in innate immunity with potent cytotoxic activity, are an unlikely cause of COVID-19 severity. Their numbers are relatively stable during aging and in a mouse model of SARS, they were not necessary for normal viral clearance. To discern which of these cell types play the most destructive roles, more detailed analyses of COVID-19 patient autopsy tissue will be needed.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !d = Additionally, the production and diversity of mucins, protective glycoproteins found in mucosal barriers throughout the body, also change in aging, although their role in immunity against coronaviruses in humans is understudied.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !e = The aging adaptive immune system: Immunosenescence of the adaptive immune system is also a likely factor that determines whether a patient progresses to severe COVID-19. Situated just above the heart, the thymus – a primary lymphoid organ and the site of T cell development and maturation of early thymic progenitors from the bone marrow – is one of the first tissues to experience aging. By age 65, the thymus is on average ~40% its original size [34], coincident with activation of the inflammasome component NLRP3 and Caspase-1, a pro-apoptotic protease [35, 36]. A build-up of intrathymic adipocytes further reduces thymic cellularity and deteriorates the thymic microenvironment. Thymic atrophy also contributes to a reduction of naïve T cells and an accumulation of memory lymphocytes, resulting in defective immunosurveillance and an exhaustion of B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !f = Other common effects of aging on the adaptive immune system include a decline in the production of fresh naïve T cells, a less expansive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, T cell metabolic dysfunction, and weaker activation of T cells [38, 39]. Clonal populations of CD8+ T cells expand during aging, limiting their diversity, whereas CD4+ T cells retain fairly diverse TCRs [40] and, instead, suffer activation deficits [39].

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !g = Interestingly, one study found that supercentenarians – defined as adults over 110 years old – tend to have an unusual population of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells whose activation doesn’t decline with age and can take on the effector functions usually performed by CD8+ T cells [41]. This T cell behavior may explain why some older people, even some people over 100, are able to survive COVID-19. Measuring the repertoire and frequency of TCRs in patients from a spectrum of ages and disease severity should be performed to determine if a loss of T cell diversity is a reason why SARS-CoV-2 viral loads tend to spike in older people but not the young.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !h = Not only does the repertoire of T cells decline in aging, so do their numbers. Those over 60 years old increasingly have low T cell numbers, a condition known as lymphopenia [42]. Because T cells express very low levels of ACE2, the lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients is unlikely to be caused by direct SARS-CoV-2 infection

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !i = One proposed cause of the T cell paucity is an exhaustion of the immune system driven by repeated exposures to viruses over one’s lifetime [42, 44, 45]. This hypothesis is based on several studies that tracked the morbidity and mortality of people over 60 who had been chronically infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [46, 47]. Cycles of CMV reemergence were associated with vast immune system remodeling, including a pronounced exhaustion of CD8+ T cells that was more predictive of all-cause mortality than chronological age.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !j = Other studies indicate that T cell depletion is due to the cumulative exposure to many different pathogens and lifestyle factors, not CMV alone [46, 48]. At the chromosomal level, a major cause of immune exhaustion is telomere shortening in viral-specific memory CD8+ T cells, which induces cellular senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest and hyper-inflammation that prevents expansion upon re-infection [49]. The fact that in the most severe COVID-19 cases bronchoalveolar CD8+ T cells appear to have reduced expansion capability [25] and peripheral blood T cells express high levels of the immune-exhaustion marker PD-1 [42] make this theory plausible.

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !k = B cells – adaptive immune cells which produce antibodies in response to coronavirus antigens [21] – are also less diverse and less responsive in aging [50, 51]. While total B cells numbers do not decrease in aging, memory B cells accumulate and naïve B cells are depleted, which may lead to loss of diversity of the B cell repertoire, although this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in humans [51].

    quote !l = Changes in IgG glycosylation patterns, however, have been shown to strongly associate with age and inflammation, and predict age-associated disease development [52]. In particular, IgG N-glycans appear to be the most predictive of biological aging, however B-cell intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of glycosylation in aging require further study.

    quote !m = Due to a lack of sun exposure and decreased production of vitamin D, about half of all older people have a deficiency in this vitamin [53], which reduces the efficacy of both adaptive and innate immune responses and increases the risk of infection [54]. Vitamin D levels in older people are correlated with preserved features of immunity such as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after stimulus. A recent meta-analysis of 25 randomized, placebo-controlled trials concluded that vitamin D supplementation prevented about 20% of acute respiratory infections [59]. As such, some health professionals have recommended vitamin D supplementation for older people in general and especially for aged-care residents and critically ill patients as a strategy for improving chances of COVID-19 survival.

    quote !n = Increased inflammation and cytokine storms in the aged: The cytokine profiles of late-stage COVID-19 patients are similar to patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, a type of cytokine storm that can be triggered by systemic viral infection, including increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, C-reactive protein (CRP), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP1-α) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α

    quote !o = Even more predictive of death than serum cytokine profiles is an increase in the fibrin degradation product D-dimer, released from blood clots in the microvasculature, and a prognostic for DIC [9]. As such, D-dimer is now widely regarded as a key indicator of the severity of late-stage COVID-19. D-dimer levels naturally increase with age, most likely reflecting a higher basal level of vascular inflammation [65], which could predispose patients to severe COVID-19. It would, therefore, be informative to know if pre-cytokine storm levels of D-dimer levels could predict who is likely to develop a cytokine storm

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !p = In cytokine storms, high levels of IL-6 cause vascular endothelial cells to secrete fibrin, which causes DIC. In the lung, this may underlie the hypoxemia seen in patients with seemingly functional lungs. If left untreated, clots leach additional clotting factors from the bloodstream, increasing the risk of bleeding (coagulopathy) and multi-organ failure. Drugs such as tocilizumab (Actemra), which block IL-6 receptor activity, are currently being used in patients in advanced stages

    quote !q = One in two fatal cases of COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm, 82% of whom are over the age of 60 [67]. Though there may be many simultaneous triggers of the storm, abundant evidence indicates that inflammaging is a major driver, exacerbated by obesity, poor diets and oral health, microbial dysbiosis, and sedentary lifestyles

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !r = A central player that could help explain the predisposition to cytokine storms is NLRP3, the major protein component of the inflammasome. During aging, there is a steady increase in the abundance and activity of NLRP3 in immune cells, including AMs of the lung which, upon chronic stimulation, contribute to pulmonary fibrosis.n older individuals, NLRP3 may be poised for hyperactivation by SARS-CoV-2 antigens. NLRP3 activity is under the direct control of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a member of the NAD+-dependent sirtuin family of deacetylases (SIRT1-7) [75]. During aging, NAD+ levels decline, reducing the activity of the sirtuins [76]. Old mice, especially those deficient in SIRT2, have decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance [77]. This decline, exacerbated by COVID-19, might promote hyperactivation of NLRP3 and the trigger cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !s = Maintaining NAD+ levels may therefore alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, a possibility supported by recent data showing that SARS-CoV-2 proteins hyperactivate poly-ADP-ribose polymerases PARP9, -10, -12, and -14 and deplete cellular NAD+ [78]. Additionally, NAD+ precursors lower inflammation in human subjects

    / May, 2020 - Aging
    quote !t = Mechanisms of infection in other coronaviruses support the hypothesis that NLRP3 activation is a trigger of cytokine storms in the aged. The SARS-CoV-1 ORF3a protein, for example, is a potent activator of pro-IL-1β gene transcription and protein maturation, the two main signals required for activation of NLRP3 [81]. In macrophages, SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 in cytosolic dot-like structures [82], suggesting another two-step model, in which inflammaging and the NLRP3 basal overactivation is the first step and SARS-CoV-2 antigen-mediated hyperactivation is the second step that triggers a cytokine storm.

    quote !u = Indeed, in older adults, the upregulation of two inflammasome-related gene sets correlate with increased risk of hypertension, metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress and mortality [84]. Individuals over the age of 85 that expressed lower levels of these inflammasome modules were less likely to die within seven years [84]. Taking together, the known effects of coronavirus proteins on NAD+, NLRP3, and the two stages of inflammasome activation, these data provide a plausible explanation as to why co-morbidities positively correlate with cytokine storms and fatality in COVID-19 patients.

    quote !v = After age and hematological cancers, obesity is the next major risk factor for COVID-19 fatality, similar to type 2 diabetes [85]. Obesity is well known to increase the activity of NLRP3 and stimulate low grade inflammation in mice, including higher levels of serum chemokines, and lower neutralizing antibodies and effector memory T cells during a viral infection [86]. Accordingly, this may help explain why obesity is associated with lower survival in COVID-19, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections, and why obesity-related human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes, predispose patients to cytokine storms (Table 1) [87–89]. In addition, by causing the endothelium of the microvasculature to become leaky, obesity and type 2 diabetes, may increase the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect surrounding pericytes that appear to express ACE2 at levels far greater than surrounding cells [12].

    quote !w = Biological clocks: Over the past decade, a variety of biological clocks have been developed to predict human health and longevity more accurately than chronological age, including those based on DNA methylation patterns [134–136], inflammaging [137], gene expression patterns [138], frailty [139, 140], serum proteins [141], and IgG glycosylation [142–144]. Given that these clocks provide a quantitative measure of the rate of aging of an individual and their overall resilience, biological clocks may be useful for identifying at-risk populations and for predicting, within those populations, who will most likely progress to severe COVID-19.

    quote !x = Glycosylation clocks: Changes in glycosylation during aging may also predispose older individuals to severe COVID-19 [148]. Glycosylation is the enzymatic process by which carbohydrates called glycans, such as sialic acid, mannose and fucose, are covalently attached to proteins or lipids, typically on the cell surface or in the bloodstream. An individuals repertoire of glycans – a notable example being the type of N-glycans attached to immunoglobulins  – changes with age and environmental factors, such as smoking and poor diet. The type of glycans attached to IgGs affects their pro- and anti-inflammatory properties.

    quote !y = Decreased galactosylation of IgGs is associated with central adiposity  and inflammaging in the context of diabetes. Biological clocks based on IgG glycosylation are able to predict chronological age within 10 years, and can be improved by inclusion of clinical parameters. Thus, changes to the glycome with age could serve both as an indicator of biological age and could potentially predict COVID-19 severity.

  ref 'Li_et_al_05_29_2020
    head = We firstly showed that COVID‐19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest risk of all‐cause mortality compared with COVID‐19 patients with known diabetes, hyperglycemia and normal glucose. Patients with COVID‐19 need to be under surveillance for blood glucose screening.

    > Context
      No studies evaluated the prospective association between hyperglycemia assessed by laboratory measurements and the risk of mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19).

    > Objective
      We aimed to evaluate the association between different degrees of hyperglycemia and the risk of all‐cause mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.

    > Design
      A retrospective study.

    > Setting
      Union Hospital in Wuhan, China.

    > Participants
      453 patients were admitted to the hospital with laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐Cov‐2 infection from January 22, 2020 to March 17, 2020.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Patients were classified into four categories: normal glucose, hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7–6.4%), newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%), and known diabetes. The major outcomes included in‐hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

    > Results
      Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest percentage to be admitted to the ICU (11.7%) and require IMV (11.7%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1%; 9.2%) and patients with hyperglycemia (6.2%; 4.7%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5%; 2.3%), respectively. The multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios of mortality among COVID‐19 patients with normal glucose, hyperglycemia, newly diagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes were 1.00, 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–16.6), 9.42 (95% CI 2.18–40.7), and 4.63 (95% CI 1.02–21.0), respectively.

    > Conclusion
      We firstly showed that COVID‐19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest risk of all‐cause mortality compared with COVID‐19 patients with known diabetes, hyperglycemia and normal glucose. Patients with COVID‐19 need to be under surveillance for blood glucose screening.

    head = We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is likely derived from a clade of viruses originating in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). The geographic location of this origin appears to be Yunnan province.

    > Abstract
      Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.

    quote !a = Our phylogenetic analysis shows a high diversity of CoVs from bats sampled in China, with most bat genera included in this study (10/16) infected by both α- and β-CoVs. In our phylogenetic analysis that includes all known bat-CoVs from China, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is likely derived from a clade of viruses originating in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.)

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !b = The geographic location of this origin appears to be Yunnan province. However, it is important to note that: 1) our study collected and analyzed samples solely from China; 2) many sampling sites were close to the borders of Myanmar and Lao PDR; and 3) most of the bats sampled in Yunnan also occur in these countries, including R. affinis and R. malayanus, the species harboring the CoVs with highest RdRp sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. For these reasons, we cannot rule out an origin for the clade of viruses that are progenitors of SARS-CoV-2 that is outside China, and within Myanmar, Lao PDR, Vietnam or another Southeast Asian country.

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !c = Additionally, our analysis shows that the virus RmYN02 from R. malayanus, which is characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein, belongs to the same clade as both RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, providing further support for the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats in the region.

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !d = Finally, while our analysis shows that the RdRp sequences of coronaviruses from the Malayan pangolin are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, analysis of full genomes of these viruses suggest that these terrestrial mammals are less likely to be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 than Rhinolophus spp. bats.

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !e = This analysis also demonstrates that a significant amount of cross-species transmission has occurred among bat hosts over evolutionary time. Our Bayesian phylogeographic inference and analysis of host switching showed varying levels of viral connectivity among bat hosts and allowed us to identify significant host transitions that appear to have occurred during bat-CoV evolution in China.

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !f = The ancient likely origin of the Rhinolophidae in Asia and China in particular may explain the central role they played in the evolution and diversification of bat-CoVs in this region, including SARSr-CoVs, MERS-cluster CoVs, and SADSr-CoVs, which contain important human and livestock pathogens. Horseshoe bats are known to share roosts with genera from all other bat families in this study, which may also favor CoV crossspecies transmission from and to rhinolophids34 280 . A global meta-analysis showing higher rates of viral sharing among co-roosting cave bats supports this finding.

    quote !g = Vespertilionid and miniopterid bats (largely within the Myotis and Miniopterus genera) also appear to have been involved in several significant host switches during α-CoV evolution. However, no significant transition from vespertilionid bats was identified for β-CoVs and these bats exhibit a divergent β-CoV diversity compared to other bat families. Vespertilionid and miniopterid bats are characterized by strong basal phylogenetic clustering but high recent CoV diversification rates, indicating a more rapid evolutionary radiation of CoVs in these bat hosts. At the genus level, similar findings were observed for the genera Myotis, Pipistrellus and Miniopterus.

    quote !i = We revealed a significant effect of host phylogeny on β-CoV evolution while it had a minimal effect on α-CoV diversity. Contrary to the α-CoV phylogeny, the basal phylogenetic structure of β-CoVs mirrored the phylogeny of their bat hosts, with a clear distinction b/w the Yangochiroptera, encompassing the Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae, and the Yinpterochiroptera, which includes the megabat family Pteropodidae and the microbat families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae, as evidenced in recent bat phylogenies. These findings suggest a profound co-macroevolutionary process between β-CoVs & their bat hosts, even if host switches also occurred throughout their evolution as our study showed. The phylogenetic structure of α-CoVs, with numerous & closely related lineages identified in the Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae, contrasts with the β-CoV macroevolutionary pattern and suggests α-CoVs have undergone an adaptive radiation in these two Yangochiroptera families.

    quote !i1 = Our BSSVS procedure and Markov jump estimates revealed higher connectivity, both qualitatively and quantitatively, among bat families and genera in the α-CoV cross303 species transmission history. Larger numbers of highly significant host transitions and higher rates oswitching events along these pathways were of inferred for α- than β-CoVs, especially at the host family level. These findings suggest that α-CoVs are able to switch hosts more frequently and between more distantly related taxa, and that phylogenetic distance among hosts represents a higher constraint on host switches for β- than α-CoVs. This is supported by more frequent dispersal events in the evolution of α- than β-CoVs in China.

    quote !j = We also found that some bat genera were infected by a single CoV genus: Miniopterus (Miniopteridae) and Murina (Vespertilionidae) carried only α-CoVs, while Cynopterus, Eonycteris, Megaerops (Pteropodidae) and Pipistrellus (Vespertilionidae) hosted only β-CoVs. This was found despite using the same conserved pan-CoV PCR assays for all specimens screened and it can’t be explained by differences in sampling effort for these genera: for example, >250 α-CoV sequences but no β-CoV were discovered in Miniopterus bats in China during our recent fieldwork. These migratory bats, which seem to have played a key role in the evolution of α-CoVs, share roosts with several other bat genera hosting β-CoVs in China , suggesting high likelihood of being exposed to β-CoVs. Biological or ecological properties of miniopterid bats may explain this observation and clearly warrant further investigation.

    quote !k = Coronaviruses use a large diversity of receptors, and their entry into host cells is mediated by the spike protein with an ectodomain consisting of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membranefusion subunit S2. However, despite differences in the core structure of their S1 receptor binding domains (RBD), several α- and β-CoV species are able to recognize and bind to the same host receptors. Other factors such as mutation rate, recombination potential, or replication rate might also be involved in differences in host switching potential between α- and β-CoVs. A better understanding of receptor usage and other biological characteristics of these bat-CoVs may help predict their cross species transmission and zoonotic potential.

    quote !l = Our Bayesian ancestral reconstructions revealed the importance of South western and Southern China as centers of diversification for both α- and β-CoVs. These two regions are hotspots of CoV phylogenetic diversity, harboring evolutionarily old and phylogenetically diverse lineages of α- and β-CoVs. South western China acted as a refugium during Quaternary glaciation for numerous plant and animal species including several bat species, such as Rhinolophus affinis65, Rhinolophus sinicus66, Myotis davidii, and Cynopterus sphinx68. The stable and long-term persistence of bats and other mammals throughout the Quaternary may explain the deep macroevolutionary diversity of bat-CoVs in these regions. Several highly significant and ancient CoV dispersal routes from these two regions have been identified in this study. Other viruses, such as the Avian Influenza A viruses H5N6, H7N9 and H5N1, also likely originated in South western and Southern Chinese regions.

    quote !m = Our findings suggest that bat host diversity is not the main driver of CoV diversity in China and that other ecological or biogeographic factors may influence this diversity. Overall, there were no significant correlations between CoV phylogenetic diversity and bat species diversity (total or sampled) for each province or biogeographic region, apart from a weak correlation between β-CoV phylogenetic diversity and the number of bat species sampled at the province level. Yet, we observed higher than expected phylogenetic diversity in several southern provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Hunan). These results and main conclusions are consistent and robust even when we account for geographic biases in sampling effort by analyzing random subsets of the data.

    quote !n = In this study, we identified the host taxa and geographic regions that together define hotspots of CoV phylogenetic diversity and centers of diversification in China. These findings may provide a strategy for targeted discovery of bat-borne CoVs of zoonotic or livestock infection potential, and for early detection of bat-CoV outbreaks in livestock and people, as proposed elsewhere . Our results suggest that future sampling and viral discovery should target two hotspots of CoV diversification in Southern and South western China in particular, as well as neighboring countries where similar bat species live. These regions are characterized by a subtropical to tropical climate; dense, growing and rapidly urbanizing populations of people; a high degree of poultry and livestock production; and other factors which may promote cross-species transmission and disease emergence.

    quote !o = Additionally, faster rates of evolution in the tropics have been described for other RNA viruses which could favor cross-species transmission of RNA viruses in these regions. Both SARS-CoV and SADS-CoV emerged in this region, and several bat SARSr-CoVs with high zoonotic potential have recently been reported from there, although the dynamics of their circulation in wild bat populations remain poorly understood. Importantly, the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2, a SARS-related virus, was found in a Rhinolophus sp. bat in this region, although it is important to note that our survey was limited to China, and that the bat hosts of this virus also occur in nearby Myanmar and Lao PDR.

Our finding that Rhinolophus spp. are most likely to be involved in host switching events makes them a key target for future longitudinal surveillance programs, but surveillance targeted the genera Hipposideros and Aselliscus may also be fruitful as they share numerous β-CoVs with Rhinolophus bats.

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !q = We have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADSCoV in pigs in Guangdong province. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population. Future work discovering and characterizing the biological properties of bat α-CoVs may therefore be of potential value for public and livestock health.

The Rhinolophidae and the Vespertilionidae for α-CoVs and th Hipposideridae for β-CoVs received the highest numbers of switching events.

    head = The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3%. County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms.

    > Abstract
      Knowing the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections is essential for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic. The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available. Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies.

We see the same patterns in the United States, with observed rates being much higher during the initial part of the pandemic.

To the extent that COVID-19 is more infectious than flu and does not have any protection from a vaccine or treatment, the number of infections, and hence the number of deaths, would be higher.

We hope that simulations to understand and forecast the impact of such shortages can be improved using our estimates of IFR-S as the baseline.

    head =  Cytokine patterns are predictive of COVID-19 survival and mortality, independently of demographics, comorbidities, but also of standard clinical biomarkers of diseases severity, including laboratory and clinical factors. IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Patients with high IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.

    > Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.

    quote !u = Early cytokine measurements are reliable predictors of outcome and therefore raise the critical importance of using serum cytokine levels for treatment decisions. The predictive value of these cytokines may help to inform therapeutic interventions to determine which individuals are likely to develop respiratory failure, end organ damage, and death. Cytokine levels can serve to evaluate appropriateness for pharmacotherapy with available or experimental agents and to select optimal trial designs to disrupt the underlying inflammatory milieu. A prediction model built on cytokine levels early in disease may serve to inform health care allocation and prioritization of individuals at highest risk.



  # Variant population, cancer patients, mortality
  // COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer on chemotherapy or other anticancer treatments: a prospective cohort study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31173-9
  ref 'Lee_et_al_05_28_2020
    head = Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

    > Background
      Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer.

    > Methods
      In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission.

    > Findings
      From March 18, to April 26, 2020, we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52%) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28%) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 9·42 [95% CI 6·56–10·02]; p<0·0001), being male (1·67 [1·19–2·34]; p=0·003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (1·95 [1·36–2·80]; p<0·001) and cardiovascular disease (2·32 [1·47–3·64]). 281 (35%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (1·18 [0·81–1·72]; p=0·380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks.

    > Interpretation
      Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

  // Cumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New York
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.25.20113050
  ref 'Rosenberg_et_al_05_29_2020
    head = Over 2 million adult NYS residents were infected through the end of March. Our findings estimate the extent of transmission of and community experience with SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the NYC metropolitan region. Despite large numbers of persons acquiring SARS-CoV-2, this represents only 14.0% of adult residents, suggesting that, even in this COVID-19 epicenter, the epidemic is substantially below the ~70% US herd immunity threshold.

    > Importance
      New York State (NYS) is an epicenter of the United States' COVID-19 epidemic. Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies, but US data are lacking, in part because societal closure complicates study conduct.

    > Objective
      To estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and percent of infections diagnosed in New York State, overall and by region, age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Design: Statewide cross-sectional seroprevalence study, conducted April 19-28, 2020.

    > Design
      Grocery stores (n=99) located in 26 counties throughout NYS, which were essential businesses that remained open during a period of societal closure and attract a heterogenous clientele.

    > Setting
      Convenience sample of patrons >=18 years and residing in New York State, recruited consecutively upon entering stores and via an in-store flyer.

    > Participants
      Convenience sample of patrons >=18 years and residing in New York State, recruited consecutively upon entering stores and via an in-store flyer.

    > Exposures
      Region (New York City, Westchester/Rockland, Long Island, Rest of New York State), age, sex, race and ethnicity.

    > Main Outcomes
      Primary outcome: cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on dry-blood spot (DBS) SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity; secondary outcome: percent of infections diagnosed.

    > Results
      Among 15,101 adults with suitable DBS specimens, 1,887 (12.5%) were reactive using a validated SARS-CoV-2 IgG microsphere immunoassay (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 99.75%). Following post-stratification weighting on region, sex, age, and race and ethnicity and adjustment for assay characteristics, estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%, 95% CI: 27.2-31.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2% 95% CI, 18.1-22.3%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%, 95% CI: 9.4-15.4%) adults than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, 95% CI: 7.4-8.7%, p<.0001). Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5%-24.0). Dividing diagnoses reported to NYS by estimated infection-experienced adults, an estimated 8.9% (95% CI: 8.4-9.3%) of infections were diagnosed, with those ≥55 years most likely to be diagnosed (11.3%, 95% CI: 10.4-12.2%).

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      Over 2 million adults were infected through late March 2020, with substantial variations by subpopulations. As this remains below herd immunity thresholds, monitoring, testing, and contact tracing remain essential public health strategies.

  ref 'Chandrashekar_et_al_05_20_2020
    head = SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques induced humoral and cellular immune responses and provided protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced protective immunity against re-exposure in nonhuman primates.

    > Abstract
      An understanding of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for vaccine and public health strategies aimed at ending the global COVID-19 pandemic. A key unanswered question is whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in protective immunity against re-exposure. We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that macaques had high viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, humoral and cellular immune responses, and pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. Following initial viral clearance, animals were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 and showed 5 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa compared with primary infection. Anamnestic immune responses following rechallenge suggested that protection was mediated by immunologic control. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced protective immunity against re-exposure in nonhuman primates.

    quote !a = We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that recapitulates many aspects of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, including high levels of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and clear pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, RNAscope, and CyCIF imaging demonstrated multifocal clusters of virus infected cells in areas of acute inflammation, with evidence for virus infection of alveolar pneumocytes and ciliated bronchial epithelial cells. These data suggest the utility of rhesus macaques as a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection for testing vaccines and therapeutics and for studying immunopathogenesis, and our findings complement and extend recently published data in cynomolgus macaques.

Consistent with these data, plaque assays in BAL and NS samples following rechallenge showed no recoverable virus and were lower than following primary infection (P = 0.009 and 0.002, respectively, two-sided Mann-Whitney tests). Moreover, little or no clinical disease was observed in the animals following rechallenge.

We demonstrate vaccine protection with substantial >3.1 and >3.7 log10 reductions in median viral loads in BAL and NS, respectively, in S immunized animals compared with sham controls.

    > Abstract
      The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has made the development of a vaccine a top biomedical priority. In this study, we developed a series of DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and evaluated them in 35 rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. Following vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in >3.1 and >3.7 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, as compared with sham controls. Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates.

  // Repeated seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a population-based sample from Geneva, Switzerland
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088898
  ref 'Stringhini_et_al_05_06_2020
    head = Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

    > Background
      Assessing the burden of COVID-19 based on medically-attended case counts is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions and the wide spectrum of disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys provide one avenue for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic, overcoming many of these limitations.

    > Methods
      Taking advantage of a pool of adult participants from population-representative surveys conducted in Geneva,  Switzerland, we implemented a study consisting of 8 weekly serosurveys among these participants and their household members older than 5 years. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population.

    > Results
      In the first three weeks, we enrolled 1335 participants coming from 633 households, with 16% <20 years of age and 53.6% female, a distribution similar to that of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343). This increased to 6.1% (95% CI 2.6-9.33, n=416) in the second, and to 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third week. We found that 5-19 year-olds (6.0%, 95% CI 2.3-10.2%) had similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5%, 95%CI 4.99-11.7), while significantly lower seroprevalence was observed among those 50 and older (3.7%, 95% CI 0.99-6.0, p=0.0008).

    > Interpretation
      Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

While the sample size of older adults was small, the lower seroprevalence estimates in this group suggest that targeted efforts to reduce social mixing of elderly people with others may have succeeded. However, it remains possible that, because of an age-related compromised ability to generate adaptive immune responses, the elderly develop a lower IgG response fter infection, something that needs further investigation.

Further, we show that three weeks after the peak of confirmed cases, only 1 in 10 people has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, even in one of the more heavily affected areas in Europe. Thus, assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies measured in this study is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity.

    head = Viral species-specific responses identified in patients suggest that these RBDs are immunologically distinct. If so, interventions must target each viral species differently to achieve maximum efficacy. Our findings somewhat answer why many previously isolated SARS-CoV antibodies fail to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite detectable binding with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

    > Abstract
      The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a global health emergency in urgent need of interventions1–3. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the target cells depends on binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the ACE2 cell receptor. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We identified antibodies with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity that correlates with their competitive capacity with ACE2 for RBD binding. Surprisingly, neither the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBDs, although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric Spike proteins was found. Crystal structure analysis of RBD-bound antibody revealed steric hindrance that inhibits viral engagement with ACE2 and thereby blocks viral entry. These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are viral species-specific inhibitors. The antibodies identified here may be candidates for the development of SARS-CoV-2 clinical interventions.

    > Abstract
      Understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is important for vaccine development, interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis, and calibration of pandemic control measures. Using HLA class I and II predicted peptide ‘‘megapools,’’ circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified in 70% and 100% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively. CD4+ T cell responses to spike, the main target of most vaccine efforts, were robust and correlated with the magnitude of the antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titers. The M, spike, and N proteins each accounted for 11%–27% of the total CD4+ response, with additional responses commonly targeting nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a, and ORF8, among others. For CD8+ T cells, spike and M were recognized, with at least eight SARS-CoV-2 ORFs targeted. Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in 40%–60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting crossreactive T cell recognition between circulating ‘‘common cold’’ coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      The coronavirus family member, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causal agent for the pandemic viral pneumonia disease, COVID-19. At this time, no vaccine is available to control further dissemination of the disease. We have previously engineered a synthetic DNA vaccine targeting the MERS coronavirus Spike (S) protein, the major surface antigen of coronaviruses, which is currently in clinical study. Here we build on this prior experience to generate a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The engineered construct, INO-4800, results in robust expression of the S protein in vitro. Following immunization of mice and guinea pigs with INO-4800 we measure antigen-specific T cell responses, functional antibodies which neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and biodistribution of SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies to the lungs. This preliminary dataset identifies INO-4800 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting further translational study.

The DNA plasmid manufacture process allows for scalable manufacture of drug product, which has the potential to circumvent the complexities of conventional vaccine production in eggs or cell culture.

    > Abstract
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21–5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 33% to below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.

    head = This study has identified three indicators (LDH, hs-CRP and lymphocytes), together with a clinical route, for COVID-19 prognostic prediction. We have developed an XGBoost machine learning-based model that can predict the mortality rates of patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy, enabling detection, early intervention and potentially a reduction of mortality in patients with COVID-19.

    > Abstract
      The sudden increase in COVID-19 cases is putting high pressure on healthcare services worldwide. At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.

    quote !c = The increase of hs-CRP, an important marker for poor prognosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome, reflects a persistent state of inflammation.

    quote !d = Finally, our results also suggest that lymphocytes may serve as a potential therapeutic target. This hypothesis is supported by the results of clinical studies. Lymphopenia is a common feature in patients with COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality. Injured alveolar epithelial cells could induce the infiltration of lymphocytes, leading to persistent lymphopenia, as was seen in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV (they share similar alveolar penetrating and antigen presenting cell (APC) impairing pathways). A biopsy study has provided strong evidence of substantially reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated20. Also, Jing and colleagues have reported that the lymphopenia is mainly related to the decrease in CD4 and CD8 T cells21. It is thus likely that lymphocytes play distinct roles in COVID-19, which deserves further investigation.

The structural characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of Nsp1 may aid structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to 40S and 80S ribosomes, resulting in shutdown of capped mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and of native human Nsp1-ribosome complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C-terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection. Thus, the structural characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of Nsp1 may aid structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2.

Similarities between the exaggerated immune response associated with COVID-19 or sepsis in general and the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) reported in patients with CAR T-cell therapy led to the use of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 therapy to attenuate hyperimmune responses associated with COVID.

    > Abstract
      Anti-inflammatory therapies such as IL-6 inhibition have been proposed for COVID-19 in a vacuum of evidence-based treatment. However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary infection. To determine whether IL-6 inhibition is associated with an increased occurrence of secondary infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of patients during an 8-week span and compared the incidence of secondary infection in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. The study was approved by the IRB. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. The study was conducted in a cohorted COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary care university medical center. Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to the adult COVID-19 intensive care unit with COVID-19 were randomly selected. We reviewed the occurrence and nature of secondary infections and clinical outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Measures were formulated prior to the study. For autopsy findings, we were interested in the lung pathology. 60 patients were selected of which 28 had received tocilizumab while 32 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (64.3% vs. 31.3%, p=0.010) and fungal (7.1% vs. 0%, p=0.096) infections. 7 cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases, tocilizumab had previously been given. All 3 patients demonstrated evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.

    > Abstract
      There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure development is contingent on the availability of robust, scalable, and readily deployable surrogate viral assays to screen antiviral humoral responses, and define correlates of immune protection, and to down-select candidate antivirals. Here, we describe a highly infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S as its sole entry glycoprotein that closely resembles the authentic agent in its entry-related properties. We show that the neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera can be assessed in high-throughput fluorescent reporter assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and that neutralization of the rVSV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spike-specific antibodies in these antisera is highly correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the development of spike-specific vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral entry and its inhibition.

    head = We characterized the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using an in vitro model of the air-lung epithelial barrier. We found that pHAE cultures are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, but mount a weak innate antiviral response, that is notably lacking type I and III IFN production, signaling, and induction of ISGs.

    > Abstract
      The newly emerged human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness. The innate immune response is critical for protection against Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNFα, CXCL8. We also identified NF-κB and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.

    > Abstract
      The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in active form, mimicking the replicating enzyme. The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template-product duplex. The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the second turn of RNA. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged ‘sliding poles’. These sliding poles can account for the known processivity of the RdRp that is required for replicating the long coronavirus genome3. Our results enable a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

      COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. Immune dysregulation has been implicated, but immune responses remain poorly understood. We analyzed 71 COVID-19 patients compared to recovered and healthy subjects using high dimensional cytometry. Integrated analysis of ∼200 immune and >30 clinical features revealed activation of T cell and B cell subsets, but only in some patients. A subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses could reach >30% of circulating B cells. However, another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable to uninfected subjects. Stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to trajectories of disease severity change. These analyses identified three “immunotypes” associated with poor clinical trajectories versus improving health. These immunotypes may have implications for therapeutics and vaccines.

    > Abstract
      Vaccines for 17 viral pathogens have been licensed for use in humans. Previously, two critical biological parameters of the pathogen and the host–pathogen interaction—incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity—were proposed to account for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and to be useful in estimating the “certainty of success” of developing an effective vaccine for viral pathogens for which a vaccine currently does not exist. In considering the “certainty of success” in development of human coronavirus vaccines, particularly SARS-CoV-2, a third, related critical parameter is proposed—infectious inoculum intensity, at an individual-level, and force of infection, at a population-level. Reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) is predicted to lengthen the incubation period, which in turn is predicted to reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus. Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the “certainty of success” of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself.

    > Background
      The degree to which children and young people are infected by and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus is unclear. Clinical series and testing cohorts based upon screening of symptomatic cases provide biased estimates of susceptibility in children. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour.

    > Methods
      We undertook a rapid systematic review of contact-tracing studies and population-screening studies to address the question What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults? We searched PubMed and medRxiv on 16 May 2020 and identified 6327 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references (2) and professional contacts (4). We assessed quality, summarized findings and undertook a random effects meta-analysis of contact-tracing studies.

    > Results
      18 studies met inclusion criteria; 9 contact-tracing, 8 population-screening and 1 systematic-review. Meta-analysis of contact tracing studies showed that the pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults for all contact tracing studies was 0.44 (0.29, 0.69) with substantial heterogeneity (63%). Findings from a systematic review of household clusters of COVID-19 found 3/31 (10%) were due to a child index case and a population-based school contact tracing study found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and not suitable for meta-analysis. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and an Italian municipal study showed markedly lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence amongst children and young people, however studies from Stockholm, England and municipalities in Switzerland and Germany showed showed no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children.

    > Conclusions
      There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 56% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.

    > Background
      Progressive respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19.

      We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro–computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression.

    > Results
      In patients who died from Covid-19–associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth — predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis — was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).

    > Conclusion
      In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection. The universality and clinical implications of our observations require further research to define. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)

      The progression of COVID-19 worldwide can be tracked by identifying mutations within the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that occur as a function of time. Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L–1 air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable (‘live’), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample. The complete SAR-CoV-2 genomic sequence was nevertheless determined by Sanger sequencing and most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously described in Georgia, USA. Results of this study illustrate the feasibility of tracking progression of the COVID-19 pandemic using environmental aerosol samples instead of human specimens. Collection of a positive sample from a distance more than 2 m away from the nearest patient traffic implies the virus was in an aerosol.

    > Abstract
      During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.

Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).

    > Findings
      96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.

    > Interpretation
      We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

    head = In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death.

    > Background
      Hydroxychloroquine has been widely administered to patients with Covid-19 without robust evidence supporting its use.

    > Methods
      We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score.

    > Results
      Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.

    > Conclusions
      In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)

    > Objectives: To understand SARS-Co-V-2 infection and transmission in UK nursing homes in order to develop preventive strategies for protecting the frail elderly residents. Design: An outbreak investigation.
    > Setting:
      4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Participants: 394 residents and 70 staff in nursing homes.
    > Interventions:
      Two point-prevalence surveys one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality, and mortality attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in residents and staff.
    > Results:
      Overall, 26% (95% confidence interval 22 to 31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70 to 336). Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35 to 46) of residents, of whom 43% (95% CI 34 to 52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11 to 24) had atypical symptoms, as well as 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

  # Immmunephenotype - Immune Response

  ref 'Mudd_et_al_05_15_2020
    head =  We have demonstrated that the immunophenotype of COVID-19 and influenza patients vary widely. Two forms of COVID-19 immune dysregulation were observed: a cytokine storm phenotype in a small proportion of patients and a far more common phenotype characterized by targeted immunosuppression.

    > Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high incidence of acute respiratory failure. The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.

    > Abstract
      An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–3, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)4 spread globally. Countermeasures are needed to treat and prevent further dissemination of the virus. In this study, we report the isolation of 2 specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from a convalescent COVID-19 patient. CA1 and CB6 demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, CB6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus monkeys at both prophylactic and treatment settings. Further structural studies revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct interface-residue competition. Our results suggest CB6 deserves further clinical translation.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 causing a global pandemic, with the United Kingdom (UK) one of the hardest hit countries. Rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 evolves relatively slowly, but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny. To understand these discrepancies, we used veSEQ3, a targeted RNA-seq approach, to quantify minor allele frequencies in 413 clinical samples from two UK locations. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity, which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure. These results were reproducible in data from other sequencing locations around the UK, where we find evidence of mixed infection by major circulating lineages with patterns that cannot readily be explained by artefacts in the data. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 diversity is transmissible, and propose that geographic patterns are generated by co-circulation of distinct viral populations. Co-transmission of mixed populations could open opportunities for resolving clusters of transmission and understanding pathogenesis.

    > Background
      Information about incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of HIV-infected individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is scarce. We characterised individuals with COVID-19 among a cohort of HIV-infected adults in Madrid.

    > Methods
      In this observational prospective study, we included all consecutive HIV-infected individuals (aged ≥18 years) who had suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as of April 30, 2020, at the Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain). We compared the characteristics of HIV-infected individuals with COVID-19 with a sample of HIV-infected individuals assessed before the COVID-19 pandemic, and described the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19.

    > Findings
      51 HIV-infected individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 (incidence 1·8%, 95% CI 1·3–2·3). Mean age of patients was 53·3 years (SD 9·5); eight (16%) were women, and 43 (84%) men. 35 (69%) cases of co-infection had laboratory confirmed COVID-19, and 28 (55%) required hospital admission. Age and CD4 cell counts in 51 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were similar to those in 1288 HIV-infected individuals without; however, 32 (63%) with COVID-19 had at least one comorbidity (mostly hypertension and diabetes) compared with 495 (38%) without COVID-19 (p=0·00059). 37 (73%) patients had received tenofovir before COVID-19 diagnosis compared with 487 (38%) of those without COVID-19 (p=0·0036); 11 (22%) in the COVID-19 group had previous protease inhibitor use (mostly darunavir) compared with 175 (14%; p=0·578). Clinical, analytical, and radiological presentation of COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals was similar to that described in the general population. Six (12%) individuals were critically ill, two of whom had CD4 counts of less than 200 cells per µL, and two (4%) died. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR remained positive after a median of 40 days from symptoms onset in six (32%) individuals, four of whom had severe disease or low nadir CD4 cell counts.

Although testing capacity has been limited in many areas of the world, HDSS provide a pre-existing structure in resource-limited settings that is purpose-built for surveillance, with both expertise and infrastructure for conducting population-based surveys

    > Abstract
      A coordinated system of disease surveillance will be critical to effectively control the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute’s Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response.
      The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care – conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures. In this protocol we report the details of our cohort design, questionnaires, data and reporting structures, and standard operating procedures in hopes that our project can inform similar efforts elsewhere.

    > Abstract
      Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to significant mental health stresses, potentially with modifiable risk factors. To determine the presence of and magnitude of associations between baseline associations and anxiety and depression in the US general population, we performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race- stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) were male. Baseline demographic data were similar between those that were (n=663, 66.2%) and were not (n=339, 33.8%) under a shelter in place/ stay at home order, with the exception of sex and geographic location. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.49, 0.87]) and living in a larger home (OR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting anxiety criteria.

Income, media consumption, and religiosity were not associated with mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression are common in the US general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are associated with potentially modifiable factors.

    > Abstract
      New York City (NYC) has emerged as one of the epicenters of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To identify the early transmission events underlying the rapid spread of the virus in the NYC metropolitan area, we sequenced the virus causing COVID-19 in patients seeking care at the Mount Sinai Health System. Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States. Moreover, we find evidence for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different neighborhoods of the city.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa549
  ref 'Rosenberg_et_al_05_08_2020
    head = In this report, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 testing in NYS through March 31 and describe the demographics, risk-factors, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital outcomes for the first 229 COVID-19 cases, from epidemiological investigations and hospital record-linkage. Using address-linked testing data we assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among household contacts of these cases.

    > Background
      The United States’ COVID-19 epidemic has grown extensively since February 2020, with substantial associated hospitalizations and mortality; New York State (NYS) has emerged as the national epicenter. We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations.

    > Methods
      Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case’s households enabled estimation of household prevalence.

    > Results
      During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case’s households found prevalent infection among 57%; excluding first-reported cases 38%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among those <5 years to 68% among those ≥65 years (p<.0001).

    > Conclusions
      New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.

We demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP.

    > Abstract
      Memory T cells induced by previous infections can influence the course of new viral infections. Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to “common cold” human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.
      Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb9153
  ref 'Li_et_al_05_19_2020
    head = SARS-CoV-2 has a nearly identical RBM (receptor binding motif) to the one found in the pangolin CoVs from Guangdong. Thus, it is plausible that RaTG13-like bat-CoV viruses may have obtained the RBM sequence binding to human ACE2 through recombination with Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like viruses. We hypothesize that this, and/or other ancestral recombination events between viruses infecting bats and pangolins, may have played a key role in the evolution of the strain that lead to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into humans.

    > Abstract
      COVID-19 has become a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis, discovering new drugs, and developing a vaccine. We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike and other genes among bat, pangolin, and human coronaviruses, suggesting similar evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2’s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2’s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species, together with frequent recombination among coronaviruses, suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.

    head = SARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct < 24 and STT (symptom onset to test) < 8 days. Infectivity of patients with Ct >24 and duration of symptoms >8 days may be low. For every 1-unit increase in Ct, the odds ratio for infectivity decreased by 32%.

    > Background
      RT-PCR has become the primary method to diagnose viral diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions. Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture.

    > Methods
      In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines.

    > Results
      Ninety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells. Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth. Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511). There was no growth in samples with a Ct > 24 or STT > 8 days. Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds ratio for positive viral culture of 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.84, p<0.001) for every one unit increase in Ct. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Ct vs. positive culture was OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97, p<0.001), with 97% specificity obtained at a Ct of >24.

    > Conclusions
      SARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct < 24 and STT < 8 days. Infectivity of patients with Ct >24 and duration of symptoms >8 days may be low. This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions. Further studies of larger size are needed.

We consider and synthesize the relevant literature.

    > Abstract
      The science around the use of masks by the general public to impede COVID-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. Policymakers need guidance on how masks should be used by the general population to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here,we develop an analytical framework to examine an overlooked aspect of mask usage: masks as source-control targeting egress from the wearer with benefits at the population-level, rather than as PPE used for ingress control for health-care workers with focus on individual outcomes. We consider and synthesize the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: 1) transmission characteristics of COVID-19, 2) filtering characteristics and efficacy of masks, 3) estimated population impacts of widespread community mask use, and 4) sociological considerations for policies concerning mask-wearing. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is likely via respiratory droplets, and is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: first, limit contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures, and second, reduce the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Given the current shortages of medical masks we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control for now, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.

    head = Most comorbidities we studied were associated with increased risk, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease including asthma, obesity, history of haematological malignancy or recent other cancer, kidney, liver, neurological and autoimmune conditions. People from Asian and black groups had a substantially higher risk of death from COVID-19, only partially attributable to co-morbidity, deprivation or other risk factors.

    > Background
      Establishing who is at risk from a novel rapidly arising cause of death, and why, requires a new approach to epidemiological research with very large datasets and timely data. Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary.

    > Data sources
      Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform.

    > Population
      17,425,445 adults.

    > Time period
      1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020.

    > Primary outcome
      Death in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19.

    > Methods
      Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings.

    > Results
      There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82).

    > Conclusions
      We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients' records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

  ref 'Dingens_et_al_2020
    head = We used serological assays to retrospectively identify SARS-CoV-2 infections in children early in the Seattle outbreak. Although our study used sera collected from children seeking medical care and therefore does not represent an unbiased population survey, it nonetheless represents the first large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serological survey of children. In particular, seropositivity increased markedly from March to April of 2020, and most seropositive children had never tested positive for virus. However, the overall frequency of seropositivity was low (»1%) even in April, suggesting that while infections of children are often missed by viral testing perhaps due to the lack of symptoms, only a small fraction of children in Seattle had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of April 2020.

    > Abstract
      Children are strikingly underrepresented in COVID-19 case counts. In the United States, children represent 22% of the population but only 1.7% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. One possibility is that symptom-based viral testing is less likely to identify infected children, since they often experience milder disease than adults. To better assess the frequency of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, we serologically screened 1,775 residual samples from Seattle Children's Hospital collected from 1,076 children seeking medical care during March and April of 2020. Only one child was seropositive in March, but nine were seropositive in April for a period seroprevalence of >1%. Most seropositive children (8/10) were not suspected of having had COVID-19. The sera of most seropositive children had neutralizing activity, including one that neutralized at a dilution >1:18,000. Therefore, among children seeking medical care, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased markedly during the early Seattle outbreak despite few positive viral tests.

    > Abstract
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 5,000,000 cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with significant fatality rate. Due to the urgency of this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary safety and efficacy studies. Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S) protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.

    quote !a = Transmission by aerosols of the small droplets studied here can only be prevented by use of high-performance face masks; a conventional surgical mask only stops 30% of the small aerosol droplets studied here for inhaled breath; for exhaled breath the efficacy is much better

    # / May, 2020 - The Lancet
    # quote !b = We found two distinct types of drops, large droplets (100–1000 μm in diameter) and small droplets (1–10 μm), with the small droplets being much more prevalent. During speech, only the small droplets were found. Although large droplets have been specifically related to coughs,4 here we observe that both sizes of droplet are produced by coughing.

    / May, 2020 - The Lancet
    quote !c = Large droplets were observed to fall onto the ground rapidly. We found that although the speed of the drops ranged 2–7 m/s at the start of the cough, the visible large drops (typically 500 μm in diameter) do not travel far before their trajectory bends down due to gravity to rapidly fall onto the ground within 1 s.

    / May, 2020 - The Lancet
    quote !d = These small droplets are of specific interest because they have been associated with aerosol transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. We also investigated droplets coming from the nasal cavity, and found that with normal breathing no droplets are detected above the background noise level. From a sneeze, we found mostly very large drops, originating from both the buccal and nasal cavities, that are not persistent.

    / May, 2020 - The Lancet
    quote !e = In the best ventilated room, after 30 s the number of droplets had halved, whereas with no ventilation this took about 5 min, in agreement with the air drag calculation that shows that 5 μm drops from the average cough or speech height take 9 min to reach the ground. In a poorly ventilated room, the number of droplets was halved in 1·4 min.

    / May, 2020 - The Lancet
    quote !f = Our findings confirm that improving ventilation of public spaces will dilute and clear out potentially infectious aerosols. To suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we believe health-care authorities should consider the recommendation to avoid poorly ventilated public spaces as much as possible. The implications are also important for hospital settings where aerosolisation by coughing and medical treatments and close contact with COVID-19 patients is very common.

    quote !a = Xiao et al. report that SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR results can remain positive up to five weeks after onset of symptoms. The authors studied RT-qPCR results from 56 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Prolonged positive test results were associated with older age and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Additionally, there were four patients with two consecutive negative test results who later tested positive again. A limitation is that the test reports did not report out Ct values, which would have provided valuable information about the amount of viral RNA in the samples, important particularly later in the course of infection.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !b = When testing is available, decisions to lift isolation rely heavily on negative PCR tests to define a patient as no longer infectious. However, if a positive PCR test is intended to mean infectivity, then this approach may not be optimal. Closer examination of what the test results mean clinically, particularly when results are from RNA quantities near the lower limit of detection of the assay, could help guide clinical and public health strategies.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !c = The Ct value is inversely related to the viral load and every ~3.3 increase in the Ct value reflects a 10-fold reduction in starting material. Many qPCR assays involve a Ct cutoff of 40 to consider the test positive, allowing detection of very few starting RNA molecules.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !d = High sensitivity for viral RNA can be helpful for initial diagnosis. However, reporting as a binary positive or negative result removes useful information that could inform clinical decision making.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !e = Following complete resolution of symptoms, people can have prolonged positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR test results, potentially for weeks, as Xiao et al report. At these late time points,the Ct value is often very high, representing presence of very low copies of viral RNA. In these cases, where viral RNA copies in the sample may be fewer than 100, results are reported to the clinician simply as positive. This leaves the clinician with little choice but to interpret the results no differently than for a sample from someone who is floridly positive and where RNA copies routinely reach 100 million or more.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !f = A positive RT-qPCR result may not necessarily mean the person is still infectious or that they still have any meaningful disease. First, the RNA could be from nonviable or killed virus. Live virus is often isolable only during the first week of symptoms but not after day 8, even with positive RT-qPCR tests. Second, there may need to be a minimum amount of viable virus for onward transmission.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !g = For infection control purposes, the utility of the assay is greatest when identifying people who are floridly positive and at risk of further transmission. Particularly when testing in the absence of symptoms for COVID-19, we believe that reporting the Ct value or range could help to better inform clinical decisions.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !h = We propose that for inpatients whose symptoms have fully resolved and two tests over 24 hours apart are either negative or close to the Ct cutoff (i.e. Ct >34), they likely do not have meaningful or transmissible disease, and thus do not need to be retested. This would conserve valuable testing capacity, reagents, and PPE.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !i = Furthermore, the clinician could take the Ct results in context and determine when the patient can discontinue isolation. This could shorten duration of isolation and for healthcare workers and other essential workers would provide a more evidence-based, testing-informed pathway for more rapid return to work. Taking the Ct value into account may also help justify symptom-based strategies recommended by the CDC including time-since-illness-onset and time-since-symptom-resolution based approaches (i.e.lifting of isolation after ten days following resolution of symptoms.)

    # / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    # quote !j = Lastly, there may be implications for public health screening, enabling contact tracers to focus on persons most likely to be infectious. This will become increasingly important as asymptomatic screening expands.

    # / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    # quote !k = The Ct value could be high as a result of early disease and the Ct value would have to be considered in clinical context. A person with a high Ct value tested early in the disease course might be or become infectious and this would present as a significant decrease in Ct value 24 hours following the first test.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !l = A patient with resolved symptoms and two Ct values both close to the cutoff is likely recovering and no longer infectious.

    # / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    # quote !m = By accounting for the Ct value in context, RT-qPCR results can be used in a way that is personalized, highly sensitive, and also more specific. To implement this, the actual Ct values could be reported along with reference ranges or converted to viral load and or categorized as high, medium, or low.

    # / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    # quote !o = Repeat testing over 24 hours is not always feasible and is always resource heavy when testing is limited. Time since symptom onset or time since symptom resolution based approaches may be as or more useful in many situations. As more detailed data emerge and provide increased certainty about the length of infectivity, there may be discussion about shifting entirely to these time-based criteria.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !p = As long as resource limitations in testing and PPE exist, we believe that time-since symptom resolution and test-based strategies should continue to coexist and complement one another. Healthcare workers, who may have easier access to testing and who may be most crucial to get back to work quicker might benefit by test-based clearance, particularly if the Ct value is considered.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    quote !q = It should be recognized that certain populations may tend to remain infectious for longer showed that older patients were more likely to have prolonged positive results and presumably longer infectivity. Severe disease is also a risk factor for longer viral shedding.

  ref 'ONeill_et_al_2020
    head = Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been reported to decrease susceptibility to respiratory tract infections, an effect proposed to be mediated by the general long-term boosting of innate immune mechanisms, also termed trained immunity. This paper proposes that induction of trained immunity by BCG could provide protection against COVID-19, but this hypothesis needs to be tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.

    quote !a = Soon after its introduction in Europe in the 1920s, epidemiological studies reported that BCG vaccination strongly reduced infant mortality, and this could not be explained by a reduction in tuberculosis alone. Later on, similar studies in other locations, including randomized controlled trials, showed an up to 50% reduction of mortality induced by BCG in young infants. This reduction in childhood mortality by BCG appeared to be due to the protection against unrelated infectious agents and especially respiratory tract infections and neonatal sepsis. Although the authors did not discriminate between bacterial and viral infections in these studies, it is well known that viral pathogens are the main cause of respiratory tract infections in children.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !b = This hypothesis was strengthened by a study in Guinea-Bissau showing that BCG reduced the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus infection. A similar protective effect of BCG on respiratory tract infections was found in older individuals in Indonesia, and a clinical trial performed in Japan demonstrated protection against pneumonia in tuberculin-negative older individuals. Last, a recent study in adolescents in South Africa also reported a 70% reduction of respiratory tract infections by BCG vaccination

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !c = Spencer et al. showed that BCG reduced viral titres of influenza A virus in mice, an effect dependent on macrophages. BCG vaccination also protected from herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) in a controlled infection model with newborn mice, while subcutaneous administration of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of the mycobacterial cell wall, protected against vaccinia virus and HSV2 infections in mice. This effect was mediated by peritoneal macrophages, suggesting strong effects of BCG on the innate immune component of host defence. In line with this, a recent murine study showed that intravenous BCG delivery led to increased cytokine production by both splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages upon ex vivo restimulation with various unrelated pathogens.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !d = BCG vaccination of healthy human volunteers results in enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6, when monocytes from these individuals are stimulated ex vivo with unrelated pathogens. Interestingly, these effects are accompanied by transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of the myeloid cells in the BCG-vaccinated individuals. The epigenetic changes are manifested as chemical modifications (methylation and acetylation) of the histone, resulting in enhanced chromatin accessibility, easier transcription of genes important for antimicrobial responses and improved cell function. In addition, metabolic reprogramming leads to selective accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites that regulate this process, owing to their function as cofactors for several classes of enzymes that mediate the epigenetic changes.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !e = It has been hypothesized that induction of trained immunity is at least partly the mechanism through which BCG vaccination induces its beneficial effects. The idea here is that BCG leads to epigenetically trained populations of monocytes and/or natural killer cells, which most likely reside in the bone marrow. Upon challenge with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; which could be from bacteria or viruses) these innate immune cells then show an enhanced response, promoting host defence. This might explain why a vaccine for tuberculosis leads to protection against multiple pathogens.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !f = In a recent study in healthy human volunteers, it has been shown that BCG vaccination reduces viraemia in response to the yellow fever vaccine (which is a live attenuated vaccine). This response is associated with epigenetic changes in monocytes that correlate with improved antiviral responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that the induction of trained immunity by BCG vaccination results in significant protection against multiple viral infection

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !g = On the basis of these data, it has been hypothesized that BCG vaccination might be a potent preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or may reduce COVID-19 disease severity. Ecological studies have suggested that countries and regions that mandate BCG vaccination for the population have a lower number of infections and a reduced mortality from COVID-19. While these data could indeed suggest a protective effect of BCG vaccination, such studies cannot provide definitive proof of causality, owing to several inherent biases.These include differences in, one, demographic and genetic structure of the populations in different locations; two, differences in the non-pharmaceutical interventions being adopted in different locations (such as quarantine or social distancing); three, differences in diagnosing and reporting COVID-19 cases; and, four, differences in the positions on the epidemic curve of each location.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !h = Notwithstanding these issues, the link to BCG and COVID-19 from these studies is intriguing. It is not known whether older people would maintain a pool of trained monocytes many years after BCG vaccination. A possible explanation is that children who have been vaccinated with BCG are less susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and so there is less spread of the virus to older populations, although this would need to be demonstrated.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !i = Because of these important limitations, randomized controlled trials are needed to provide the highest quality proof for the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may protect against COVID-19. It is reasonable to propose that these are first initiated in populations at high risk of infection or with a high risk of mortality, such as hospital staff working in close contact with patients with COVID-19 or older individuals.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !j = Trials assessing the efficacy of BCG vaccination in these categories of individuals are currently being performed in the Netherlands, Australia and Greece, while other trials are being planned in the United States, UK, Denmark, France, Uruguay, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !k = One important aspect relates to the boosting of the innate immune response by BCG. Might this be deleterious, considering the fact that an exaggerated cytokine response has been associated with complications in patients with COVID-19? We would argue that in healthy individuals vaccinated with BCG, in which innate antimicrobial mechanisms would be boosted by trained immunity, this is most likely to lead to inhibited viral replication, decreased viral loads and subsequently less inflammation and symptoms. This hypothesis is supported by the decrease in viraemia seen following yellow fever vaccination of individuals who were previously vaccinated with BCG.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !l = By contrast, an initial defective antiviral response in some individuals at high risk (for example, older individuals) can result in high viral loads, stimulation of an inefficient systemic inflammation and severe disease. Breaking the loop of systemic inflammation could have beneficial effects in these patients.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    quote !m = The use of approaches to induce trained immunity for protection against COVID-19 may not be restricted to BCG: indeed, there is speculation that oral polio vaccine might protect against non-related viral infections, and the new recombinant BCG-based vaccine VPM1002 may have similar effects and is also being considered for clinical trials.

    quote !a = A 50-year-old, previously healthy man presents to the emergency department with 2 days of worsening dyspnea. He had fever, cough, and fatigue during the week before presentation. He appears acutely ill. The body temperature is 39.5°C (103°F), heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 130/60 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation is 87% while the patient is breathing ambient air. The white-cell count is 7300 per microliter with lymphopenia. Chest radiography shows patchy bilateral opacities in the lung parenchyma.

    quote !b = The most common initial symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgias, and diarrhea. Severe illness usually begins approximately 1 week after the onset of symptoms. Dyspnea is the most common symptom of severe disease and is often accompanied by hypoxemia. A striking feature of Covid-19 is the rapid progression of respiratory failure soon after the onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !c = Patients with severe Covid-19 commonly meet the criteria for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is defined as the acute onset of bilateral infiltrates, severe hypoxemia, and lung edema that is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. The majority of patients with severe Covid-19 have lymphopenia, and some have disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system.

    quote !d = Severe Covid-19 may also lead to acute cardiac, kidney, and liver injury, in addition to cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and shock. These organ failures may be associated with a cytokine release syndrome characterized by high fevers, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and elevation of other inflammatory markers.

    quote !f = People with chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are more likely to become critically ill from Covid-19. The incidence of critical illness is also higher among men than among women and higher among persons older than 65 years of age than among younger persons. However, healthy persons of any age can become critically ill with Covid-19. A hallmark of the Covid-19 pandemic is the sudden appearance of an unprecedented number of critically ill patients in a small geographic area.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !g = BASICS OF RESPIRATORY CARE: Patients should be monitored carefully by direct observation and pulse oximetry. Oxygen should be supplemented by the use of a nasal cannula or Venturi mask to keep the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin between 90 and 96%. Deciding whether or not to intubate is a critical aspect of caring for seriously ill patients with Covid-19. Clinicians must weigh the risks of premature intubation against the risk of sudden respiratory arrest with a chaotic emergency intubation, which exposes staff to a greater risk of infection. Signs of excessive effort in breathing, hypoxemia that is refractory to oxygen supplementation, and encephalopathy herald impending respiratory arrest and the need for urgent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is no single number or algorithm that determines the need for intubation, and clinicians must consider a variety of factors.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !h = If the patient does not undergo intubation but remains hypoxemic, a high-flow nasal cannula can improve oxygenation and may prevent intubation in selected patients.18,19 The use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation should probably be restricted to patients with Covid-19 who have respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or obstructive sleep apnea rather than ARDS. However, some experts discourage the use of high-flow nasal cannulae and noninvasive ventilation because these treatments may inappropriately delay recognition of the need for endotracheal intubation and expose clinicians to infectious aerosols.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !i = Having awake patients turn to the prone position while they breathe high concentrations of supplemental oxygen may improve gas exchange in patients with severe Covid-19. This approach is supported by a case series describing its use in nonintubated patients with ARDS unrelated to Covid-19. However, whether prone positioning can prevent intubation in patients with severe Covid-19 is unclear. Because it is difficult to provide rescue ventilation to patients who are prone, this position should be avoided in patients whose condition is rapidly deteriorating.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !j = ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION: If possible, intubation should be performed after preoxygenation and rapid-sequence induction of sedation and neuromuscular blockade. An antiviral filter should be placed in line with the airway circuit at all times. Video laryngoscopy may allow the operator to have a good view of the airway from a greater distance. However, operators should choose the technique that is most likely to be successful on the first attempt. Continuous-wave capnography is the best method to confirm tracheal intubation. Patients with Covid-19 often become hypotensive soon after intubation owing to positive-pressure ventilation and systemic vasodilation from sedatives. Therefore, intravenous fluids and vasopressors should be immediately available at the time of intubation, and careful hemodynamic monitoring is essential.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !k = VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT: To prevent alveolar overdistention, clinicians should limit both the tidal volume delivered by the ventilator and the maximum pressure in the alveoli at the end of inspiration. To do this, clinicians should set the ventilator to deliver a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight; this approach is termed “lung-protective ventilation.” A tidal volume up to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight is allowed if the patient becomes distressed and attempts to take larger tidal volumes.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !l = A few times each day, clinicians should initiate a half-second end-inspiratory pause, which allows the pressure in the airway circuit to equilibrate between the patient and the ventilator. The pressure in the airway circuit at the end of the pause — “the plateau pressure” — approximates the alveolar pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure). To prevent alveolar overdistention, the plateau pressure should not exceed 30 cm of water. A higher plateau pressure without the development of ventilator-induced lung injury may be possible in patients with central obesity or noncompliant chest walls.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !m = For patients with Covid-19–related ARDS, setting sufficient positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator may prevent alveolar collapse and facilitate the recruitment of unstable lung regions. As a result, PEEP can improve respiratory-system compliance and allow for a reduction in the Fio2. However, PEEP can reduce venous return to the heart and cause hemodynamic instability. Moreover, excessive PEEP can lead to alveolar overdistention and reduce respiratory-system compliance. No particular method of determining the appropriate level of PEEP has been shown to be superior to other methods.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !n = Sedatives and analgesics should be targeted to prevent pain, distress, and dyspnea. They can also be used to blunt the patient’s respiratory drive, which improves patient synchrony with mechanical ventilation. Sedation is especially important in febrile patients with high metabolic rates who are treated with lung-protective ventilation. Neuromuscular blocking agents can be used in deeply sedated patients who continue to use their accessory muscles of ventilation and have refractory hypoxemia. These agents can reduce the work of breathing, which reduces oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Moreover, sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents may help reduce the risk of lung injury that may occur when patients generate strong spontaneous respiratory efforts.

    quote !o = REFRACTORY HYPOXEMIA: Clinicians should consider prone positioning during mechanical ventilation in patients with refractory hypoxemia (Pao2:Fio2 of <150 mm Hg during respiration and Fio2 of 0.6 despite appropriate PEEP). In randomized trials involving intubated patients with ARDS (not associated with Covid-19), placing the patient in the prone position for 16 hours per day has improved oxygenation and reduced mortality.18,29 However, prone positioning of patients requires a team of at least three trained clinicians, all of whom require full PPE.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !p = Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., inhaled nitric oxide) can also improve oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure, although they do not improve survival in ARDS not associated with Covid-19. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential rescue strategy in patients with refractory respiratory failure. However, ECMO may not be effective owing to the cytokine storm and hypercoagulability of Covid-19, and its use will probably be limited as the pandemic strains resources.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !q = SUPPORTIVE CARE: Patients with Covid-19 often present with volume depletion and receive isotonic-fluid resuscitation. Volume repletion helps maintain blood pressure and cardiac output during intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. After the first few days of mechanical ventilation, the goal should be to avoid hypervolemia. Fever and tachypnea in patients with severe Covid-19 often increase insensible water loss, and careful attention must be paid to water balance.

    quote !s = In case series, approximately 5% of patients with severe Covid-19 have received renal-replacement therapy; the pathophysiology of the renal failure is currently unclear but is probably multifactorial.

    quote !t = Abnormalities of the clotting cascade, such as thrombocytopenia and elevation of d-dimer levels, are common in patients with severe Covid-19 and are associated with increased mortality. Prophylactic low-dose heparin should be used to reduce the risk of venous thrombosis. However, in one series of critically ill patients with Covid-19, one third had clinically significant venous or arterial thrombosis despite thromboprophylaxis. Life-threatening thrombosis has also occurred despite full-dose anticoagulation with heparins. The benefits and risks of more intense anticoagulation or of using direct thrombin inhibitors in patients with severe Covid-19 are unknown.

    quote !u = Patients hospitalized with severe Covid-19 are often treated empirically with antibiotics. However, bacterial coinfection is rare when patients first present to the hospital. Antibiotics can be discontinued after a short course if signs of bacterial coinfection, such as leukocytosis and focal pulmonary infiltrates, are absent. Although Covid-19 itself can cause prolonged fever, clinicians should be vigilant for nosocomial infections.

    > Abstract
      Full genome sequences are increasingly used to track the geographic spread and transmission dynamics of viral pathogens. Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. A phylogenetic analysis including thousands of globally sampled sequences allowed us to infer multiple independent introductions into Israel, followed by local transmission. Returning travelers from the U.S. contributed dramatically more to viral spread relative to their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around ~2.0-2.6, dropping by two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. A comparison between reported and model-estimated case numbers indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 1-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings underscore the ability of this virus to efficiently transmit between and within countries, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing its spread.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1092-0
  ref 'Adam_et_al_2020
    head = We identified 4–7 Superspreading events (SSEs) across 51 clusters and observed that 19% (15–24%) of cases were responsible for 80% of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission, while 69% (65–71%) of cases did not transmit to anyone.

    > Abstract
      Superspreading events (SSEs) have characterized previous epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections1,2,3,4,5,6. For SARS-CoV-2, the degree to which SSEs are involved in transmission remains unclear, but there is growing evidence that SSEs might be a typical feature of COVID-197,8. Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection. We identified 4–7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n = 309 cases) and estimated that 19% (95% confidence interval, 15–24%) of cases seeded 80% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P = 0.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P = 0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95% CI, 1.9–107.2). Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

  // Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain COVID-19 in China
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2293-x
  ref 'Lai_et_al_2020b
    head = Our results highlight that countries should consider proactively planning NPIs and relevant resources for containment and mitigation, and to the likely effectiveness of different NPIs at different stages of an outbreak. Reducing contact and increasing social distance, together with improved personal hygiene can protect vulnerable populations and mitigate COVID-19 spread at the community level, and these interventions should be promoted throughout the outbreak to avoid resurgence.


    > Abstract
      On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic1. The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings3. Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data4,5, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.

    quote !c = However, the apparent effectiveness of different interventions varied. The lockdown of Wuhan might not have prevented the seeding of the virus from the city, as the travel ban was put in place at the latter stages of pre-CNY population movement out of the city. Nevertheless, if inter-city travel restrictions were not implemented, cities and provinces outside of Wuhan would have received more cases from Wuhan, and the affected geographic range would have expanded to the remote western areas of China.

    quote !d = Generally, the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to quickly and substantially prevent more infections than contact reduction and social distancing across the country (5-fold versus 2.6-fold). However, without the intervention of contact reductions, in the longer term, the epidemics would increase exponentially across regions. Therefore, combined NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment, with about a one-week interval from NPIs to epidemic peak.

The geographical range of affected areas would also shrink from 308 cities to 192, 130, and 61 cities, respectively. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later than they were, cases may have shown a 3-fold (IQR 2 - 4), 7-fold (5 - 10), or 18-fold (11 - 26) increase, respectively.

    quote !f = If population contact resumed to the normal levels seen in previous years, the lifting of travel restrictions since February 17 might cause case numbers to rise again  Accordingly, our simulations suggest that maintaining social distancing at even a limited degree (e.g. 25% contact reduction on average) through late April would help ensure control of COVID-19 in epicentres like Wuhan.

    quote !g = Our findings show that combined NPIs substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China. Earlier implementation of NPIs could have significantly reduced the magnitude and geographical range of the outbreak, but equally, a delayed response would have lead to a larger outbreak.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    quote !h = Our results suggest three key points. First, they support and validate the idea that population movement and close contact has a major role in the spread of COVID-19 within and beyond China. As the lockdown of Wuhan happened at the latter stages of the pre-CNY movement, travel restrictions did not halt the seeding of the virus from Wuhan, but did prevent cases being exported from Wuhan to a wider area.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    quote !i = Secondly, the importance and effects of the three types of NPIs differed. Compared to travel restrictions, improved detection and isolation of cases as well as the social distancing likely had a greater impact on the containment of outbreak. The social distancing intervention reduced contact with people who travelled from the epicentre of the outbreak. This is likely to have been especially helpful in curbing the spread of an emerging pathogen to the wider community, and reduced the spread risk from asymptomatic or mild infections.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    quote !j = Third, given travel and work resuming in China, the country should consider at least the partial continuation of NPIs to ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak is sustainably controlled for the first wave of this outbreak. For example, early case identification and isolation should be maintained, which may also help to prevent and delay the arrival of a second wave, considering the increasing numbers of cases imported from other countries and the presence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections found in China.

    # / May, 2020 - Nature
    # quote !k = The analyses presented here represent the most comprehensive study yet in which the effect of NPIs on COVID-19 transmission has been quantitatively assessed. The model framework accounts for daily interactions of populations, interventions between and within cities, as well as the inherent statistical uncertainty associated with a paucity of epidemiological parameters, before and after the implementation of interventions. The network-based SEIR model is methodologically robust and built on the basic SEIR models previously used to predict COVID-19 transmission in its early stages. Considering delays in case reporting, our approach can be used for rapid, ongoing estimation of the effectiveness of various NPIs in different countries for outbreakcontrol decision-making.

  // Convalescent plasma treatment of severe COVID-19: A matched control study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20102236
  ref 'Liu_et_al_2020i
    head =    This initial assessment offers evidence in support of convalescent plasma transfusion as an effective intervention in COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation. Preliminary data suggest a potential mortality benefit, but greater numbers are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Interestingly, these data suggest that the survival effect of convalescent plasma may begin to manifest more than 1 week after transfusion. If this observation is borne out in subsequent studies, it could indicate that convalescent plasma prevents longer-term complications, such as acute lung injury or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; however, this speculation awaits confirmation in a larger patient cohort.

    > Background
      Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing mass morbidity and mortality. Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls.

    > Methods
      Plasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti43 spike antibody titer of ³1:320 dilution. Matched control patients were retrospectively identified within the electronic health record database. Supplemental oxygen requirements and survival were compared between plasma recipients and controls.

    > Results
      Convalescent plasma recipients were more likely than control patients to remain the same or have improvements in their supplemental oxygen requirements by post-transfusion day 14, with an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). Plasma recipients also demonstrated improved survival, compared to control patients(log-rank test: p=0.039). In a covariates-adjusted Cox model, convalescent plasma transfusion improved survival for non-intubated patients (hazard ratio 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05 ~0.72); p=0.015), but not for intubated patients (1.24 (0.33~4.67); p=0.752).

    > Conclusions
      Convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.

      We report a time course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge during the Spring COVID-19 outbreak in a northeastern U.S. metropolitan area. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all environmental samples and, when adjusted for the time lag, the virus RNA concentrations were highly correlated with the COVID-19 epidemiological curve (R2=0.99) and local hospital admissions (R2=0.99). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were a seven-day leading indicator ahead of compiled COVID-19 testing data and led local hospital admissions data by three days. Decisions to implement or relax public health measures and restrictions require timely information on outbreak dynamics in a community.

The strong correlation between the virus RNA and COVID-19 case data provides an approach to independently evaluate the local SARS-CoV-2 testing rate and to estimate the number of new cases.

    quote !k = While the results here demonstrate the potential utility of such an approach, we note that these relationships could be treatment plant specific, as primary sludge process trains are not uniform, and that compiled COVID-19 testing is prompted by symptoms, thus underestimating the true number of cases

    quote !l = Our study could have substantial policy implications. Jurisdictions can use primary sludge SARS-CoV-2 concentrations to preempt community outbreak dynamics or provide an additional basis for easing restrictions, especially when there are limitations in clinical testing. Raw wastewater and sludge-based surveillance is particularly useful for low and middle-income countries where clinical testing capacity is limited.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764
  ref 'Beigel_et_al_2020
    head = Preliminary results of this trial suggest that a 10-day course of remdesivir was superior to placebo in the treatment of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

    > Background
      Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), none have yet been shown to be efficacious.

    > Methods
      We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.

    > Results
      A total of 1063 patients underwent randomization. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group. Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04). Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).

    > Conclusions
      Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

  // High SARS-CoV-2 Attack Rate Following Exposure at a Choir Practice — Skagit County, Washington, March 2020
  doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6919e6
  ref 'Hamner_et_al_2020
    head = Following a 2.5-hour choir practice attended by 61 persons, including a symptomatic index patient, 32 confirmed and 20 probable secondary COVID-19 cases occurred; three patients were hospitalized, and two died. Transmission was likely facilitated by close proximity (within 6 feet) during practice and augmented by the act of singing.

    > Abstract
      On March 17, 2020, a member of a Skagit County, Washington, choir informed Skagit County Public Health (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill. Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir’s member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2–5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.

  // Excess mortality from Covid-19. Weekly excess death rates by age and sex for Sweden.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096909
  ref 'Modig_et_al_2020
    head = Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women.

    > Objectives
      Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden.

    > Design
      We make use of Swedish register data about total weekly deaths, total population at risk, and estimate age- and sex-specific weekly death rates for 2020 and the 5 previous years. The data is provided by Statistics Sweden.

    > Results
      From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women.

    > Conclusion
      The Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a clear and consistent effect on total mortality in Sweden, with male death rates being comparably more affected. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on mortality and life expectancy will depend on the progression of the pandemic, the extent that some of the deaths would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic, only somewhat later, the consequences for other health conditions, as well as the health care sector at large.

    quote !h = We cannot draw any conclusions about whether the mortality difference truly stem from different chances of surviving Covid-19, or a difference in the risk of getting affected, neither can we explain the mechanisms to the observed sex differences Even if the number of confirmed cases is similar for men and women in Sweden, and in other countries, it is still confirmed cases and not all cases. However, based on the confirmed cases it clearly seems as if men have higher fatality. This together with our finding that excess mortality follows the same age-pattern for men and women but with higher levels for men at all ages may suggest biological explanations.

    > Abstract
      We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections. ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075911
  ref 'Bhattacharyya_et_al_2020
    head = SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.

    > Abstract
      COVID-19 pandemic is a major human tragedy. Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other preexisting subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.

    quote !a = The A2a subtype is characterized by the D614G mutation near the S1-S2 junction on the Spike protein. D614G mutation introduces an additional cleavage site in the S protein that is specific for elastase, a serine protease, generally produced by the neutrophils. Sequential digestion at multiple sites on the S1-S2 junction of S protein is necessary for SARS-CoV-2, to enter into the host cell.

    quote !b = The cascade of cleavage is also dependent on the availability of host protease in the vicinity. Multiple digestions at the S1-S2 junction region produce “decoy” fragments which reduces host immune response by binding and inactivating antiviral antibodies giving the virion an advantage to overcome the first line of host defence. It has been shown that for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are indispensable, while endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) are not.

The SRCR domain interacts with external pathogens and helps in positioning of the protease head towards the substrate.

    / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !g =  The SARS-CoV-2 A2a subtype specific D614G mutation is in a region of the S protein that is highly conserved across the coronavirus family. We predict that the V160M mutation in the host and D614G mutation in the A2a subtype will result in reduced interaction of the SRCR domain of TMPRSS2 and the S protein of the coronavirus leading to a reduction in viral entry in the host cell. High prevalence of the V160M mutation in populations of East Asia is a likely reason for the reduced spread of A2a subtype in East Asia.

  // The disease-induced herd immunity level for Covid-19 is substantially lower than the classical herd immunity level

  ref 'Britton_et_al_2020
    head = Disease-induced herd immunity level (hD=43%) may be substantially lower then the classical herd immunity level (hC=1-1/2.5=60%) assuming R0 = 2.5. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

    > Abstract
      Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level hC is defined as hC=1-1/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level hD, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than hC. As an illustration we show that if R0=2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is hD=43% rather than hC=1-1/2.5=60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

Note that also the yellow curve, having overall fraction infected well below the classical herd immunity level hC = 60% is protected by herd immunity since no second wave appears. This clearly illustrates that the disease-induced herd immunity level hC is well below 60% – it is 43%

    # quote !g = There are of course other more efficient exit-strategies than to lift all restrictions simultaneously. In fact, most countries are currently employing a gradual lifting of preventive measures. Such slower lifting of preventive measures will avoid seeing the type of overshoot illustrated by the purple curve, which results in a greater fraction infected than the yellow curve, even though the latter has milder restrictions. The effect of such gradual lifting of restrictions will result in the final fraction infected reaching close to the disease-induced herd immunity level

    # / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    # quote !h = The current model took age cohorts and social activity levels into account. However, more complex and realistic models have many other types of heterogeneities: for instance increased spreading within households (of different sizes) or within schools and workplaces; and spatial aspects with rural areas having lower contact rates than metropolitan regions. It seems reasonable to assume that most such additional heterogeneities will have the effect of lowering the disease-induced immunity level hDS even further, in that high spreading environments (metropolitan regions, large households, big workplaces, ...) will have a higher fraction infected thus resulting in immunity being concentrated even more on highly active individuals. Some complex models do not categorize individuals into different activity levels, or the related feature in an underlying social network with varying numberof acquaintances.

  // Individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 lowers the herd immunity threshold
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081893
  ref 'Gomes_et_al_2020
    head = Models that curtail individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection overestimate epidemic sizes and herd immunity thresholds. This paper demonstrates that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure (connectivity) accelerates the acquisition of immunity in populations. More susceptible and more connected individuals have a higher propensity to be infected and thus are likely to become immune earlier. Our model shows that as the coefficient of variation increases from 0 to 4, the herd immunity threshold declines from over 60% to less than 10%.


    > Abstract
      As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the incidence of new cases to decline. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

    quote !a = Individual variation in risk of acquiring infection is under selection by the force of infection, whether individual differences are due to biological susceptibility, physical exposure, or a combination of the two traits. Selection results in the removal of the most at-risk individuals from the susceptible pool as they become infected and eventually recover (some die). This selective acquisition of infection and immunity results simultaneously in decelerated epidemic growth and accelerated induction of immunity in the population.

    / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    quote !b = In idealised scenarios of vaccines delivered at random and individuals mixing at random, herd immunity thresholds are given by a simple formula (1 − 1⁄R0) which, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, suggests that 60-70% of the population should be immunised to halt spread considering estimates of R0 between 2.5 and 3. A crucial caveat in exporting these calculations to immunization by natural infection, is that natural infection does not occur at random.

    / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    quote !c = Individuals who are more susceptible or more exposed are more prone to be infected and become immune earlier, which lowers the threshold.

    # / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    # quote !e = Heterogeneity in the transmission of respiratory infections has traditionally focused on variation in exposure summarised into age-structured contact matrices. Besides overlooking differences in susceptibility given exposure, the aggregation of individuals into age groups curtails coefficients of variation with important downstream implications. Popular models based on contact matrices use a coefficient of variation around 0.9 and perform similarly to our scenarios for CV = 1. Supported by existing estimates across infectious diseases, we argue that CV is generally higher and prognostics more optimistic than currently assumed. However plausible, this needs to be confirmed for the current COVID-19 pandemic and, given its relevance to policy decisions, it should be set as a priority

    # quote !f = Variation in infectiousness was critical to attribute the scarce and explosive outbreaks to superspreaders when the SARS-CoV-1 emerged in 2002, but infectiousness does not respond to selection as susceptibility or exposure do. Models with or without individual variation in infectiousness perform equivalently when implemented deterministically and only differ due to stochasticity in an entirely different phenomenon to that presented in this paper. Among the estimates of individual variation plotted in Figure 3, those corresponding to SARS-CoV viruses have been described as variation in individual infectiousness, but the way authors describe superspreaders is suggestive that higher infectiousness stems from higher connectivity with other individuals, who may be susceptible displayed in Figure 2, with CV = 3 for exposure to infection.

    quote !g = Interventions themselves have potential to manipulate individual variation. Current social distancing measures may be argued to either increase or decrease variation in exposure, depending on the compliance of highly-susceptible or highly-connected individuals in relation to the average. A deep understanding of these patterns is crucial not only to develop more accurate predictive models, but also to refine control strategies and to interpret data resulting from ongoing serological surveys

    # / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    # quote !i = On the one hand, if CV is very low, the most stringent control measures would need to be continued for suppression of the epidemic. The other side of that coin is a scenario where keeping only the mildest control measures (protecting the elderly to reduce mortality rates) is optimal. It would therefore be imperative to conduct longitudinal serological studies in representative samples of the population, as control measures are relaxed. Given a percent positivity in an initial survey, the speed at which that figure increases after control measures are eased would reveal what the most likely value of CV is, and simultaneously advise which control measures should be enforced.

This is highlighted by the presence of high levels of SARS-CoV-2 and the invasion of intervillous macrophages (intervillositis) within the placenta. These findings suggest that Covid-19 may have contributed to placental inflammation that ultimately resulted in early-onset preeclampsia and worsening maternal disease.

    > Abstract
      Background: The effects of Covid-19 in pregnancy remain relatively unknown. We present a case of second trimester pregnancy with symptomatic Covid-19 complicated by severe preeclampsia and placental abruption. Methods: We analyzed placenta for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular and immunohistochemical assays and by and electron microscopy, and we measured the maternal antibody response in blood to this infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. Conclusion: This case demonstrates, for the first time, SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.
