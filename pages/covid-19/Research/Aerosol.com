  // Effect of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation on Viral Aerosols
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1021/es070056u
  ref 'Walker_et_al_06_21_2007
    head = We characterized the UV disinfection of viral aerosols using the bacteriophage MS2, adenovirus, and coronavirus.

    > Abstract
      Ultraviolet (UV) germicidal air disinfection is an engineering method used to control the airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in high-risk settings. Despite the recent emergence of respiratory viral pathogens such as SARS and avian influenza viruses, UV disinfection of pathogenic viral aerosols has not been examined. Hence, we characterized the UV disinfection of viral aerosols using the bacteriophage MS2, adenovirus, and coronavirus. Our objectives were to characterize the effect of nebulization and air sampling on the survival of important viral pathogens, quantitatively characterize and estimate the UV susceptibility of pathogenic viral aerosols, and evaluate the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the susceptibility of viral aerosols, to 254 nm UV−C. The viruses were aerosolized into an experimental chamber using a six-jet Collison nebulizer, exposed to 254 nm UV, and sampled using an AGI-30 liquid impinger. Both the MS2 and adenovirus aerosols were very resistant to UV air disinfection, with a reduction of less than 1 logarithm in viable viral aerosols at a UV dose of 2608 μW s/cm2. The susceptibility of coronavirus aerosols was 7−10 times that of the MS2 and adenovirus aerosols. Unlike bacterial aerosols, there was no significant protective effect of high RH on UV susceptibility of the tested viral aerosols. We confirmed that the UV disinfection rate differs greatly between viral aerosols and viruses suspended in liquid.

  // Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Fecal Viral Shedding in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.11335
  ref 'Parasa_et_al_06_11_2020
    head = Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies.

    > Importance
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and can involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including symptoms like diarrhea and shedding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in feces.

    > Objective
      To provide a pooled estimate of GI symptoms, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and fecal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 among patients with COVID-19.

    > Data Sources
      An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020. Search terms included “COVID-19,” “SARS-Cov-2,” and/or “novel coronavirus.”

    > Study Selection
      Eligible studies were those including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported GI symptoms.

    > Data Extraction and Synthesis
      Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled estimates (%) were reported with 95% CIs with level of heterogeneity (I2).

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Study and patient characteristics with pooled detection rates for diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in feces tests were analyzed.

    > Results
      Of 1484 records reviewed, 23 published and 6 preprint studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women) with COVID-19. The pooled rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-12.2%) of patients reporting diarrhea and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) of patients reporting nausea or vomiting. The pooled rate for aspartate aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 20% (95% CI, 15.3%-25.6%) of patients, and the pooled rate for alanine aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 14.6% (95% CI, 12.8%-16.6%) of patients. Fecal tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in feces in 40.5% (95% CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients. There was high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 94%), but no statistically significant publication bias noted.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      These findings suggest that that 12% of patients with COVID-19 will manifest GI symptoms; however, SAR-CoV-2 shedding was observed in 40.5% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the need to better understand what measures are needed to prevent further spread of this highly contagious pathogen.

      The authors reviewed representative medical and dental literature for studies and reports that documented the spread of disease through an airborne route. They also reviewed the dental literature for representative studies of contamination from various dental procedures and methods of reducing airborne contamination from those procedures.

    > Results
      The airborne spread of measles, tuberculosis and SARS is well-documented in the medical literature. The dental literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria and blood. These aerosols represent a potential route for disease transmission. The literature also documents that airborne contamination can be minimized easily and inexpensively by layering several infection control steps into the routine precautions used during all dental procedures.

    > Clinical Implications
      In addition to the routine use of standard barriers such as masks and gloves, the universal use of pre-procedural rinses and high-volume evacuation is recommended.

  // Efficacy of Face Shields Against Cough Aerosol Droplets from a Cough Simulator
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2013.877591
  ref 'Lindsley_et_al_06_27_2014
    head = We used a coughing patient simulator and a breathing worker simulator to investigate the exposure of health care workers to cough aerosol droplets, and to examine the efficacy of face shields in reducing this exposure.

    > Abstract
      Health care workers are exposed to potentially infectious airborne particles while providing routine care to coughing patients. However, much is not understood about the behavior of these aerosols and the risks they pose. We used a coughing patient simulator and a breathing worker simulator to investigate the exposure of health care workers to cough aerosol droplets, and to examine the efficacy of face shields in reducing this exposure. Our results showed that 0.9% of the initial burst of aerosol from a cough can be inhaled by a worker 46 cm (18 inches) from the patient. During testing of an influenza-laden cough aerosol with a volume median diameter (VMD) of 8.5 μm, wearing a face shield reduced the inhalational exposure of the worker by 96% in the period immediately after a cough. The face shield also reduced the surface contamination of a respirator by 97%. When a smaller cough aerosol was used (VMD = 3.4 μm), the face shield was less effective, blocking only 68% of the cough and 76% of the surface contamination. In the period from 1 to 30 minutes after a cough, during which the aerosol had dispersed throughout the room and larger particles had settled, the face shield reduced aerosol inhalation by only 23%. Increasing the distance between the patient and worker to 183 cm (72 inches) reduced the exposure to influenza that occurred immediately after a cough by 92%. Our results show that health care workers can inhale infectious airborne particles while treating a coughing patient. Face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to large infectious aerosol particles, but smaller particles can remain airborne longer and flow around the face shield more easily to be inhaled. Thus, face shields provide a useful adjunct to respiratory protection for workers caring for patients with respiratory infections. However, they cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection when it is needed.

  // Effectiveness of surgical masks against influenza bioaerosols
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2013.02.007
    ref 'Booth_et_al_03_28_2013
    head = A dummy test head attached to a breathing simulator was used to test the performance of surgical masks against a viral challenge.

    > Background
      Most surgical masks are not certified for use as respiratory protective devices (RPDs). In the event of an influenza pandemic, logistical and practical implications such as storage and fit testing will restrict the use of RPDs to certain high-risk procedures that are likely to generate large amounts of infectious bioaerosols. Studies have shown that in such circumstances increased numbers of surgical masks are worn, but the protection afforded to the wearer by a surgical mask against infectious aerosols is not well understood.

    > Aim
      To develop and apply a method for assessing the protection afforded by surgical masks against a bioaerosol challenge.

    > Methods
      A dummy test head attached to a breathing simulator was used to test the performance of surgical masks against a viral challenge. Several designs of surgical masks commonly used in the UK healthcare sector were evaluated by measuring levels of inert particles and live aerosolised influenza virus in the air, from in front of and behind each mask.

    >  Findings
      Live influenza virus was measurable from the air behind all surgical masks tested. The data indicate that a surgical mask will reduce exposure to aerosolised infectious influenza virus; reductions ranged from 1.1- to 55-fold (average 6-fold), depending on the design of the mask.

    > Conclusion
      We describe a workable method to evaluate the protective efficacy of surgical masks and RPDs against a relevant aerosolised biological challenge. The results demonstrated limitations of surgical masks in this context, although they are to some extent protective.

    head = The author provides a viewpoint that aerosol transmission of viruses must be acknowledged as a key factor leading to the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is silently spreading in aerosols exhaled by highly contagious infected individuals with no symptoms. Owing to their smaller size, aerosols may lead to higher severity of COVID-19 because virus-containing aerosols penetrate more deeply into the lungs. It is essential that control measures be introduced to reduce aerosol transmission.

    quote !a = Respiratory infections occur through the transmission of virus-containing droplets (>5 to 10 µm) and aerosols (≤5 µm) exhaled from infected individuals during breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing. Traditional respiratory disease control measures are designed to reduce transmission by droplets produced in the sneezes and coughs of infected individuals. However, a large proportion of the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to be occurring through airborne transmission of aerosols produced by asymptomatic individuals during breathing and speaking. Aerosols can accumulate, remain infectious in indoor air for hours, and be easily inhaled deep into the lungs.

    quote !b = Smaller droplets and aerosols will evaporate faster than they can settle, are buoyant, and thus can be affected by air currents, which can transport them over longer distances.

  // Exhaled CO2 as COVID-19 infection risk proxy for different indoor environments and activities
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.20191676
  ref 'Peng_et_al_09_10_2020
    head = In this study, we derive the analytical expressions of the probability of indoor COVID-19 infection through room-level aerosol transmission only (i.e., assuming social distance is kept so that close proximity aerosol and droplet pathways are eliminated; fomite transmission is not included), human-exhaled CO2 concentration, and subsequently a few CO2-based quantities as infection risk proxies. Based on available data, we apply these expressions to common indoor settings.

    > Abstract
      CO2 is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people and can be used as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations indoors. Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. Contrary to some earlier recommendations setting a single indoor CO2 threshold, we show that the CO2 level corresponding to a given infection risk varies by over 2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with our infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring.

We use units of “air changes per hour” (ACH, in units of h-1) to express this rate. If a certain room has a ventilation rate with outdoor air of 1 h-1, that means that in 1 hour, 63% of the indoor air has been replaced by outdoor air. In 2 hours, that’s 86%, and in 3 hours 95%. If the ventilation rate is 6 h-1, then in 1 hour 97% of the air is replaced by outdoor air. Clearly the ventilation rate is very important to determine how long virus-laden aerosols may stay around in a given space.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !b = Determining a realistic ventilation rate for a space can be difficult. Even for some commercial buildings that have building proctors and maintenance personnel, people trying to use the estimator for those buildings are telling us that such personnel does not have information on the appropriate ventilation rates, and does not know how to obtain that information.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !c = In research, we measure the ventilation rate using a “tracer release” experiment. We release a puff of an inert, non-sticky gas that we can measure with high time resolution. For interested researchers, this paper is one of the most advanced applications of this method. We then see measure that tracer decays, and the rate of decay is the ventilation rate. CO2 is a useful tracer, as are various volatile organic compounds. CO2 has a big advantage in that humans are a ubiquitous, free source of it.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !d = The research CO2 analyzers that I have used to do this can do this cost several thousand dollars, which is prohibitive for most situations. However, I have bought and tested a $159 CO2 monitor (US, see this link for Europe), recommended by our European colleagues at REHVA, and it seems to work well. There are many other monitors that can probably do the same thing. Look for NDIR technology. I chose this one because it does have a display, traffic light feature, and Bluetooth connectivity, in addition to the endorsement from REHVA.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !e = How to estimate the ventilation rate in practice: Leave the CO2 monitor outside for at least 5 minutes to record the background concentration; Stay in the location of interest (with the CO2 monitor there) for a while, so that CO2 builds up (see Appendix 3 for ideas if that is not enough CO2 for the experiment, like for a large room or with very good ventilation). Then leave quickly, and let the analyzer record CO2 for several hours; Best to leave a fan(s) on the whole time, to mix the air in the space. This leads to a smoother decay, and makes the data easier to interpret, and it should not affect the ventilation rate. Data without a fan will look more “blobby” than the data I show here.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !f = Caveats of the ventilation rate determined in this way: This method will only quantify the ventilation rate with outdoor air. In many spaces, air is recirculated and filtered, and many virus-containing aerosols will be removed by the filter. But CO2 will be unaffected by the filters.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !g = Second, the air change rate is not constant, and can change in time. For example if you have the windows open, it will vary a lot with changes in outdoor winds. It can also change indoors depending on the dynamics of the HVAC system and other factors. Even if the windows are closed and there is no HVAC system, wind and other factors will affect the exchange rate as they can drive infiltration. For this reason, and if this is a space where you are going to spend a lot of time, it is a good idea to repeat this experiment a few times, and see that you are getting consistent results

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !h = Third, in large buildings where air can flow between spaces, either through corridors, or through the HVAC system, this can be more difficult. Experts call this interzonal transport. E.g. people on a different room may breathe CO2, that is then reach the room of interest, confusing the measurement.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !i = The first test of the quality of a gas analyzer is to see whether it responds quickly to changes in concentration. If it responds too slowly, then that would limit the measurement of fast ventilation rates. We do this by leaving the monitor in a location with high CO2, and then by quickly moving it outside.

    / August, 2020 - Medium
    quote !j = Dr. Demetrios Pagonis in my research group performed a quick experiment comparing the Aranet sensor with a research grade LI-COR sensor. The results are below. The LI-COR sensor provides data every 1 s, while the Aranet does so every 1 min. Overall I would call the results very good, for an affordable sensor like this one. Some deviations are clearly due to time response, since the Aranet does not have a sample flow and has to rely on the CO2 diffusing into the sensor volume. There is also a positive offset in this particular sensor which I have not managed to remove yet (maybe I don’t quite understand the manual on how to do this), but that is not a concern for the time response calculations. And it can be subtracted in your head, after measuring the air outdoors.

    quote !a = Natural ventilation significantly depends on the temperature difference between the indoor and the ambient air and the current wind situation. As a result, a sufficient natural ventilation cannot be guaranteed at all times.Mechanical ventilation systems can ensure a continuous air exchange throughout the year

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !b = Secure ventilation of spaces with outdoor air. Check whether the ventilation systems in classrooms, either natural or mechanical, are functioning well: Check whether windows and grids can be opened. Clean ventilations’ grids so that the air supply is not obstructed. Have mechanical ventilation systems checked for their functioning by your maintenance company.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !c = Install a CO2 monitor with traffic light indication at least in the classrooms in which ventilation depends on opening windows and/or grids. This visualizes the need for extra ventilation by opening windows. Make sure that the CO2 monitor is placed at a visible position in the classroom, away from fresh air inlets (e.g. open windows). In times of the pandemic, we suggest to temporarily change the default settings of the traffic light indicator (orange light up to 800 ppm and red light up to 1000 ppm) in order to promote as much ventilation as possible.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !d = Check operating hours of mechanical ventilation systems. Switch ventilation to nominal speed at least 2 hours before the school starts and switch to lower speed 2 hours after occupancy.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !e = Keep toilet ventilation 24/7 in operation. This also ensures a minimum of ventilation in the entire building during night-time.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !f = Switch air handling units with central recirculation to 100% outdoor air.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !g = Adjust the setpoints of CO2 controlled ventilation systems (if present). With these systems, the amount of air exchange is automatically reduced with lower occupancy to save energy. In order to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases full ventilation is needed, even if only part of the students is present. Ask your maintenance company if there is CO2 controlled ventilation present in your building. Generally, they are also the ones to adjust setpoints.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !h = Give teachers instructions on how to use the ventilation facilities: Open windows and ventilations’ grids as much as possible during school hours.Opening windows just underneath the ceiling reduces the draught risk. In rooms with mechanical air supply and exhaust this is usually not necessary, but extra ventilation is positive and does not disrupt the ventilation system.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !i = Ensure regular airing with windows during breaks (also in mechanically ventilated buildings). Make sure that ventilation facilities are not obstructed or blocked by curtains or furniture.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !j = Keep an eye on any installed CO2 monitors (ask pupils to assist). Be aware that more aerosols are released during activities such as singing or sport. Use local cooling systems, like fan coils or split units, as you usually do. Though, make sure that there is always supply of fresh outdoor air by mechanical ventilation systems or operable windows.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !k = Some installers and maintenance companies are now offering to replace filters, but this is NOT necessary to reduce infection risks. Only replace filters when necessary or already planned.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !l = In addition, one talks about cooling and humidification of air. Adjusting the setpoints of the climate system to lower values is NOT necessary and useless in schools. The same goes for placing humidifiers because there is NO evidence that this is effective. Focus on things that really matter, such as proper ventilation.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !m = In the long-term it obviously makes sense to structurally improve the ventilation, since poor indoor air quality leads to, among others, headache, fatigue and reduced learning performance.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !n = Points of attention for the sanitary facilities (taps, toilets, sewers): Flush all toilets, water taps and showers before the school reopens. If water taps haven’t been used for several weeks, the water that is still in the pipes may be of poor quality.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !o = Check if water taps in all toilets are in operating condition (with soap dispensers and paper towels) or provide other facilities to disinfect hands after using the toilet. Replace frequently used water taps with taps with a sensor, so that they can be used without touching them.

    / Guidance for Schools
    quote !p = Make sure that floor drains do not run dry to avoid an open connection to the sewer. Fill the drains regularly with water. Add some oil to prevent the water seal from evaporating quickly.

  // SARS-Cov-2RNA found on particulate matter of Bergamo in Northern Italy: First evidence
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109754
  ref 'Setti_et_al_2020
    head = We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period.

    > Background
      The burden of COVID-19 was extremely severe in Northern Italy, an area characterized by high concentrations of particulate matter (PM), which is known to negatively affect human health. Consistently with evidence already available for other viruses, we initially hypothesized the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 presence on PM, and we performed a first experiment specifically aimed at confirming or excluding this research hyphotesys.

    > Methods
      We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period. Filters were properly stored and underwent RNA extraction and amplification according to WHO protocols in two parallel blind analyses performed by two different authorized laboratories. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (E, N, and RdRP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on particulate matter.

    > Results
      The first test showed positive results for gene E in 15 out of 16 samples, simultaneously displaying positivity also for RdRP gene in 4 samples. The second blind test got 5 additional positive results for at least one of the three marker genes. Overall, we tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 20 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers. Control tests to exclude false positivities were successfully accomplished.

    > Conclusion
      This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on PM, thus suggesting a possible use as indicator of epidemic recurrence.

    > Abstract
      Although it is well established that cigarette smoking is associated with morbidity and mortality in several respiratory infections, data from recent studies suggest that active smokers are underrepresented among patients with COVID-19. This has led to claims that a ‘smoker’s paradox’ may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker’s paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells). On the other hand, smoking may worsen susceptibility and prognosis in COVID-19, in a manner similar to other respiratory infections. The claims of a protective effect must be viewed with extreme caution by both the general population as well as clinicians. Further investigations into the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it.

  // The dispersion of spherical droplets in source–sink flows and their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic

  ref 'Cummins_et_al_08_04_2020
    head = We have presented a simplified mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of spherical droplets in the presence of a source–sink pair flow field.

    > Abstract
      In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of spherical droplets in the presence of a source–sink pair flow field. The dynamics of the droplets is governed by the Maxey–Riley equation with the Basset–Boussinesq history term neglected. We find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct behaviors for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further than a specific distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum traveled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviors categorized by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with a minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few μm to a few hundred μm. The result that such droplets have a very short range could have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet dispersion.

  // Mechanistic insights into the effect of humidity on airborne influenza virus survival, transmission and incidence

  ref 'Marr_et_al_01_16_2019
    head = In this perspective article, we re-evaluate studies of influenza virus survival in aerosols, transmission in animal models and influenza incidence to show that the combination of temperature and RH is equally valid as AH as a predictor.

    > Abstract
      Influenza incidence and seasonality, along with virus survival and transmission, appear to depend at least partly on humidity, and recent studies have suggested that absolute humidity (AH) is more important than relative humidity (RH) in modulating observed patterns. In this perspective article, we re-evaluate studies of influenza virus survival in aerosols, transmission in animal models and influenza incidence to show that the combination of temperature and RH is equally valid as AH as a predictor. Collinearity must be considered, as higher levels of AH are only possible at higher temperatures, where it is well established that virus decay is more rapid. In studies of incidence that employ meteorological data, outdoor AH may be serving as a proxy for indoor RH in temperate regions during the wintertime heating season. Finally, we present a mechanistic explanation based on droplet evaporation and its impact on droplet physics and chemistry for why RH is more likely than AH to modulate virus survival and transmission.

    > Abstract
      Currently available evidence supports that the predominant route of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets and/or contact routes. The report by the World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China supports person-to-person droplet and fomite transmission during close unprotected contact with the vast majority of the investigated infection clusters occurring within families, with a household secondary attack rate varying between 3 and 10%, a finding that is not consistent with airborne transmission. The reproduction number (R0) for the SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be between 2.2–2.7, compatible with other respiratory viruses associated with a droplet/contact mode of transmission and very different than an airborne virus like measles with a R0 widely cited to be between 12 and 18. Based on the scientific evidence accumulated to date, our view is that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by the airborne route  to  any significant extent and the use of particulate respirators offers no advantage over medical masks as a component of personal protective equipment for the routine care of patients with COVID-19 in the health care setting. Moreover, prolonged use of particulate respirators may result in unintended harms. In conjunction with appropriate hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) used by health care workers caring for patients with COVID-19 must be used with attention to detail and precision of execution to prevent lapses in adherence and active failures in the donning and doffing of the PPE.

(Among rodent animal models, only guinea pigs could cough and sneeze, making them ideal for studying how respiratory diseases spread.) The guinea pigs were exposed to the infected air over a four-year period. A second group of 150 guinea pigs acted as controls: their air ducts were irradiated with UV-C lamps to kill TB bacilli.

This mode of transmission could infect far more people and was more difficult to trace than direct person-to-person contact.

    head = This review briefly highlights current topics in studies of measles virus host invasion and pathogenesis.

    > Abstract
      Measles virus is a highly contagious negative strand RNA virus that is transmitted via the respiratory route and causes systemic disease in previously unexposed humans and non-human primates. Measles is characterised by fever and skin rash and usually associated with cough, coryza and conjunctivitis. A hallmark of measles is the transient immune suppression, leading to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. At the same time, the disease is paradoxically associated with induction of a robust virus-specific immune response, resulting in lifelong immunity to measles. Identification of CD150 and nectin-4 as cellular receptors for measles virus has led to new perspectives on tropism and pathogenesis. In vivo studies in non-human primates have shown that the virus initially infects CD150+ lymphocytes and dendritic cells, both in circulation and in lymphoid tissues, followed by virus transmission to nectin-4 expressing epithelial cells. The abilities of the virus to cause systemic infection, to transmit to numerous new hosts via droplets or aerosols and to suppress the host immune response for several months or even years after infection make measles a remarkable disease.

    quote !b = The virions remain in the mucus as cell-free particles, and are moved to the upper respiratory tract (URT) by the mucocilliary escalator and discharged into the environment by coughing. MV can be transmitted by large respiratory droplets (by direct contact) or in small aerosols transported through the air over long distances.

    quote !c = The virus must remain infectious until it reaches a new host. Large droplets may increase the stability of cell-bound MV particles or cell debris that are expelled from the body, allowing the virus to survive long enough until it comes into contact with the eyes, nose or mouth of a susceptible person. Alternatively, cell-free virions transmitted airborne as small aerosols through a turbulent airflow may survive in air for at least one hour, as demonstrated during the outbreaks of measles in a paediatric practice in 1981 and at an International Special Olympics Games in 1995. One of the factors that influence survival of MV in the air is relative humidity: in aerosols, the virus is most stable below 40% or above 80% [74].

    quote !d = The last vital transmission property concerns the infectious dose of the virus. In NHPs, a single 50% tissue culture infectious dose was shown to be sufficient to establish a productive infection associated with systemic dissemination. However, measles patients shed large amounts of virus, resulting in transmission of numerous infectious units. The combination of large inoculum and low infectious dose may increase the chance of rapid deposition of virus particles in the respiratory tract of the next host, especially in a crowded and poorly ventilated environment.

In specific cases individual patients have been reported to more than 200 new patients, often referred to as “superspreading” events.

    > Abstract
      In February 1981, a measles outbreak occurred in a pediatric practice in DeKalb County, GA. The source case, a 12-year-old boy vaccinated against measles at 111/2 months of age, was in the office for one hour on the second day of rash, primarily in a single examining room. On examination, he was noted to be coughing vigorously. Seven secondary cases of measles occurred due to exposure in the office. Four children had transient contact with the source patient as he entered or exited through the waiting room; only one of the four had face-to-face contact within 1 m of the source patient. The three other children who contracted measles were never in the same room with the source patient; one of the three arrived at the office one hour after the source patient had left. The risk of measles for unvaccinated infants (attack rate 80%, 4/5) was 10.8 times the risk for vaccinated children (attack rate 7%, 2/27) (P = .022, Fisher exact test, two-tailed). Airflow studies demonstrated that droplet nuclei generated in the examining room used by the source patient were dispersed throughout the entire office suite. Airborne spread of measles from a vigorously coughing child was the most likely mode of transmission. The outbreak supports the fact that measles virus when it becomes airborne can survive at least one hour. The rarity of reports of similar outbreaks suggests that airborne spread is unusual. Modern office design with tight insulation and a substantial proportion of recirculated ventilation may predispose to airborne transmission.

    # quote !a = This pattern of superspreading could explain the puzzling lag in Italy between the arrival of the virus and the rise of the epidemic. And geneticists have found a similar lag in other countries: The first viruses to crop up in a given region don’t give rise to the epidemics that come weeks later.

  // COVID-19 Is Transmitted Through Aerosols. We Have Enough Evidence, Now It Is Time to Act
  doi: https://time.com/5883081/covid-19-transmitted-aerosols/
  ref 'Jimenez_et_al_08_25_2020
    head = Contrary to public health messaging, I, together with many other scientists, believe that a substantial share of COVID-19 cases are the result of transmission through aerosols. The evidence in favor of aerosols is stronger than that for any other pathway, and officials need to be more aggressive in expressing this reality if we want to get the pandemic under control.

    / August, 2020 - Time
    quote !a = The unwillingness to acknowledge the likelihood that aerosols are a major means of COVID-19 transmission can be traced to the legacy of Dr. Charles Chapin, an American public health researcher. Trying to bury once and for all the theory of miasmas, ghostly clouds of disease, he argued in his seminal 1910 book The Sources and Modes of Infection that aerosol transmission was nearly impossible. “It will be a great relief to most persons to be freed from the specter of infected air, a specter that has pursued the race since the time of Hippocrates,” Chapin wrote. The impact of his book was fortuitous in a way: it came at a time when enough evidence about the transmission of different infectious diseases had accumulated since the discovery of germs by Pasteur in the 1860s, but before we had the technology to measure aerosols. Chapin’s notions became the paradigm of infectious disease transmission, which has dominated until now.

    / August, 2020 - Time
    quote !b = Given this deeply held disbelief of aerosol transmission, just a few diseases, including measles and chickenpox, have been accepted as being transmitted through aerosols—and only because these are so transmissible that the evidence could not be ignored by the medical community. Some less-contagious respiratory diseases, like influenza, were described as due to droplet and fomite transmission, even when they clearly had an aerosol component. That stance has, over the years, created an unfounded perception in health care that any disease that is transmitted through aerosols has to be extremely contagious.

    / August, 2020 - Time
    quote !c = We know from detailed, rigorous studies that when individuals talk in close proximity, aerosols dominate transmission and droplets are nearly negligible. we are finding that outbreaks often occur when people gather in crowded, insufficiently ventilated indoor spaces, such as singing at karaoke parties, cheering at clubs, having conversations in bars, and exercising in gyms. Superspreading events, where one person infects many, occur almost exclusively in indoor locations and are driving the pandemic. These observations are easily explained by aerosols, and are very difficult or impossible to explain by droplets or fomites.

  // Many Americans with COVID-19 don't know how they got infected, survey suggests
  doi: https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-patients-dont-know-how-they-got-infected.html
  ref 'Rettner_et_al_06_30_2020
    head = The study researchers, from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found that more than half of U.S. patients with COVID-19 in a recent survey couldn't identify another person with the disease whom they had close contact with before getting sick. The study is based on telephone interviews with 350 adults in nine states who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 31 and May 10, and were interviewed between April 15 and May 24.

    quote !a = The findings suggest that many people may be getting infected through transmission in their communities and not from a familiar person in their lives, the CDC said. This "underscores the need for isolation of infected persons, contact tracing and testing … and prevention measures, including social distancing and use of cloth face coverings," while community transmission is ongoing, the authors said.

    / June, 2020 - Live Science
    quote !b = Overall, 46% reported that in the two weeks prior to their positive COVID-19 test they had close contact (being within 6 feet) with someone who had COVID-19; but 54% were not aware of having close contact with someone with COVID-19. When patients did report a COVID-19 contact, it was usually a family member or coworker.

    / June, 2020 - Live Science
    quote !c = The study also found that patients who were hospitalized were more likely to be older, have underlying conditions and have an income less than $25,000 a year, and were less likely to be white, than those who were not hospitalized.

    quote !a = In Favor of Aerosols: Indoors >> outdoors, Superspreading events (restaurant, choir, bus etc.) Supersp. very similar to known aerosol diseases, Very high R0 (~20) of superspreading. Poor ventilation helps transmission. Similar viruses transmitted via aerosols (SARS-CoV-1, influenza, MERS). Virus stays infective in aerosols. Infectious virus detected 2-5 m from patients. Importance of close proximity (higher aerosol dose).Consistency of close proximity & room. Importance of singing / shouting. Demonstrated w/ ferrets 1 & hamsters. Other pathogens most concentrated in fine aerosols. Aerosols from AGPs infective1, no reason why lower dose for longer time, no mask, would not infect as demonstrated for TB. Supermicron aerosols well filtered by well-fitted surgical masks.

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !b = Against Aerosols: Nothing we have found, only misconceptions

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !c = In Favor of Fomites: Virus stays infective on surfaces. Similar viruses transmit this way. Intensive hand-washing program in UK reduced trans. 16% 1 (so plays role, but not dominant).Demonstrated for hamsters (but inefficient).

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !d = Against Fomites: Against importance Lipid-enveloped viruses don’t survive long on human hands. CDC: possible, not major way. WHO: no specific evidence. Importance of close proximity encounters is not consistent w/ fomites dominant, pattern of transmission would be more random. Hamsters: “mainly by aerosols, rather than fomites”

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !e = In Favor of Large Droplets: Large droplets have larger volume than aerosols.

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !f = Against Large Droplets: Against significant contribution - Never directly demonstrated for any disease. Droplets need to be ~300 μm to be efficient at reaching others, but very few of that size when talking. Very low efficiency of delivery to susceptible (eyes, nostrils, mouth are small targets).

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !g = Against Large Droplets: Against dominance - Cannot explain outdoors << indoor. Cannot explain superspreading ev. Cannot explain impact of ventilation. Importance of a/pre-symptomatic transmission (no cough, low droplets)

    / Misconceptions about large droplets & aerosols
    quote !h = Transmission in close proximity demonstrates large droplet transmission, and disproves aerosols. The opposite is true: large droplet transmission is unlikely when talking, and aerosol transmission in maximized in close proximity situations. This concerns the physics of motion of aerosols and droplets through the air, is published, and is understood best by aerosol scientists. And since aerosol have not been considered important for disease transmission, most ID and epi researchers are not experts on aerosols (e.g. persistent 5 um error).

    / Misconceptions about large droplets & aerosols
    quote !i = A low R0 or lack of documented long-range transmission prove that this is not an airborne disease like measles: COVID-19 is indeed not like measles. Measles is a high-contagiousness aerosol-driven disease. COVID-19 is likely a lower-contagiousness aerosol driven disease. It infects best at close proximity, also at the room scale if we “help it along” (indoors, low ventilation, long time, no masks). And it has trouble infecting at long range.

    / Misconceptions about large droplets & aerosols
    quote !j = There is no basis for the R0 assumption (A low R0 or lack of documented long-range transmission prove that this is not an airborne disease like measles).This is an artifact of history, which is being confused with a law of nature! Extreme resistance to aerosol transmission, due to adoption of the paradigm of Chapin (1910) deprived us of widely-accepted examples of less-contagious aerosol transmitted diseases, that do exist. Only the most contagious ones (measles, and chickenpox) could be demonstrated, after being described as droplet/fomites for decades. If you “dial down” the contagiousness of measles, R0 will decrease. There is no reason for nature to only generate diseases that are either supercontagious through aerosols, or not contagious at all. Intermediate cases are possible, and likely include SARS, MERS, and influenza.

    / Misconceptions about large droplets & aerosols
    quote !k = That “droplet PPE” seems to work in hospitals disproves aerosols: Droplet PPE should be renamed as “droplet and lower-contagiousness / larger particle size aerosol PPE.” The particle sizes where SARS-CoV-2 most likely is (> 1 um) are reasonably well-filtered by surgical masks. And very sick people in ICUs etc. are not very contagious, outside of aerosol-generating procedures.1 Plus typically there is good ventilation in hospitals.

    / Misconceptions about large droplets & aerosols
    quote !l = Lack of long range transmission disproves aerosols: Lack of long range transmission is actually expected for a less contagious virus such as SARS-CoV-2. There is no reason in Nature why every virus that can infect through aerosols needs to be extremely contagious.1

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !m = Mask fit is critical: Pay attention to mask fit: avoid gaps, tight around the nose. Keep mask on when speaking x5-30 times more aerosols than just breathing.

    / October, 2020 -
    quote !n = Reasons why the mitigation measures work:No close proximity: much reduced aerosols (talking), also less droplets (cough). Avoid indoors: no room-level aerosols, less close proximity aerosols (wind, UV), less fomites (UV). Avoid crowded + long duration: reduced close proximity + room-level aerosols, reduced fomites and droplets. Avoid low ventilation: reduced room-level and long range aerosols. No masks: reduced close proximity, room-level, long-range, fomites, and droplets. Talking / shouting / singing: reduced close proximity, room-level, long range, droplets (also less generation of fomites).
