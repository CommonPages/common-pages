    > Abstract
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with evidence of antibody escape highlight the importance of addressing whether the total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recognition is also affected. Here, we compare SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C lineages in COVID-19 convalescents and in recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. The total reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is similar in terms of magnitude and frequency of response, with decreases in the 10 to 22% range observed in some assay/VOC combinations. A total of 7% and 3% of previously identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes, respectively, are impacted by mutations in the various VOCs. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 variants analyzed herein do not majorly disrupt the total SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity; however, the decreases observed highlight the importance for active monitoring of T cell reactivity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

  // Estimating the death toll of the Covid-19 pandemic in India
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.21257965
  ref 'Guilmoto_et_al_07_02_2021
    head = We present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes.

    > Abstract
      The absence of reliable registration of Covid-19 deaths in India has prevented the proper assessment and monitoring of coronavirus pandemic. India’s relatively young age structure tends to conceal the severity of Covid-19 mortality, which is concentrated in older age groups. In this paper, we present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes. We show that we can model the age gradient of Covid-19 mortality in India and use this modeling for estimating the level of Covid-19 mortality in the country. Our findings point to a death toll of about 2.2 million persons by late May 2021. Once India’s age structure is taken into account, these figures correspond to one of the most severe cases of Covid-19 mortality in the world.

    > Background
      India has recorded after February a second outbreak of coronavirus that has affected the entire country. The accuracy of official statistics of Covid-19 mortality has been called in question and the real number of Covid-19 deaths is thought to be several times higher than reported. In this paper, we assembled four independent population samples to model and estimate the level of Covid-19 mortality in India.


    > Methods
      We first used a first population sample with age and sex of Covid-19 victims to develop a Gompertz model of Covid-19 mortality in India. We applied and adjusted this mortality model on two other national population samples after factoring in the demographic characteristics of these samples. We finally derive from one of these samples the most reasonable estimate of Covid-19 mortality level in India and confirm this result with the use of a fourth population sample.

    > Findings
      Our findings point to a death toll of about 2.2 million persons by late May 2021. This is the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in the world. Once standardized for its age and sex structure, India’s Covid-19 mortality rate is above that of Brazil or the USA.

    > Interpretation
      Our analysis shows that existing population samples allow for an alternative estimation of deaths due to Covid19 in India. The results confirm that only one out 7 Covid-19 deaths appear to be registered in India. The estimates point to a very Covid-19 mortality rate, which is even higher after age and sex standardization. The magnitude of the pandemic in India requires immediate attention and calls for a strong response based on a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the scale-up of vaccination to make them accessible to all, with an improved surveillance system to monitor the progression of the pandemic.

    head =  We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that can be manufactured at high yields in embryonated eggs. Here we provide evidence that the NDV vector expressing an optimized spike antigen (NDV-HXP-S), upgraded from our previous construct, is a versatile vaccine that can be used live or inactivated to induce strong antibody responses and to also cross-neutralize variants of concern.

    > Abstract
      Rapid development of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and expedited authorization for use and approval has been proven beneficial to mitigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread and given hope in this desperate situation. It is believed that sufficient supplies and equitable allocations of vaccines are necessary to limit the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of additional variants of concern. We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that can be manufactured at high yields in embryonated eggs. Here we provide evidence that the NDV vector expressing an optimized spike antigen (NDV-HXP-S), upgraded from our previous construct, is a versatile vaccine that can be used live or inactivated to induce strong antibody responses and to also cross-neutralize variants of concern. The immunity conferred by NDV-HXP-S effectively counteracts SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamsters. It is noteworthy that vaccine lots produced by existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufacturers in Vietnam, Thailand and Brazil exhibited excellent immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters, demonstrating that NDV-HXP-S vaccines can be quickly produced at large-scale to meet global demands.

  // Nucleocapsid Vaccine Elicits Spike-Independent SARS-CoV-2 Protective Immunity

  ref 'Matchett_et_al_06_30_2021
    head = We show that vaccination with a human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein can establish protective immunity, defined by reduced weight loss and viral load, in both Syrian hamsters and K18-hACE2 mice.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Neutralizing Abs target the receptor binding domain of the spike (S) protein, a focus of successful vaccine efforts. Concerns have arisen that S-specific vaccine immunity may fail to neutralize emerging variants. We show that vaccination with a human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein can establish protective immunity, defined by reduced weight loss and viral load, in both Syrian hamsters and K18-hACE2 mice. Challenge of vaccinated mice was associated with rapid N-specific T cell recall responses in the respiratory mucosa. This study supports the rationale for including additional viral Ags in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, even if they are not a target of neutralizing Abs, to broaden epitope coverage and immune effector mechanisms.

    > Abstract
      Although nobody doubts the existence of long COVID in children, it is still unclear to what extent children are affected. The Ciao Corona study is a longitudinal cohort investigating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and clustering of cases among around 2500 children from 55 randomly selected primary and secondary schools in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland. Between June 2020 and April 2021, we completed three testing phases where we collected venous blood for serological analysis (ABCORA 2.0 test) and asked about symptoms with online questionnaires. We compared children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in October/November 2020 with those who tested negative. Children who were seronegative in October/November 2020 and seroconverted or were not retested by March/April 2021 were excluded from the analysis (n=256). In March-May 2021 we assessed the presence of symptoms occurring since October 2020, lasting for at least 4 weeks, and persisting for either >4 weeks or >12 weeks. Overall, 1355 of 2503 children with a serology result in October/November 2020 and follow up questionnaire in March/April 2021 were included. Among seropositive and seronegative 6-to 16-year-old children and adolescents, 9% versus 10% reported at least one symptom beyond 4 weeks, and 4% versus 2% at least one symptom beyond 12 weeks. None of the seropositive children reported hospitalization after October 2020. Seropositive children, all with a history of pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, did not report long COVID more frequently than seronegative children. This study suggests a very low prevalence of long COVID in a randomly selected population-based cohort of children followed over 6 months after serological testing.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve and recently emerging variants with substitutions in the Spike protein have led to growing concerns over increased transmissibility and decreased vaccine coverage due to immune evasion. Here, sera from recipients of a single dose of our Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine were tested for neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. All tested variants demonstrated susceptibility to Ad26.COV2.S-induced serum neutralization albeit mainly reduced as compared to the B.1 strain. Most pronounced reduction was observed for the B.1.351 (Beta; 3.6-fold) and P.1 (Gamma; 3.4-fold) variants that contain similar mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) while only a 1.6-fold reduction was observed for the widely spreading B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.

    head = We show that Ad26.COV2.S elicits humoral and cellular immune responses that cross-react with the B.1.351 variant and protects against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques.

    > Abstract
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that partially evade neutralizing antibodies poses a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines1,2. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine expresses a stabilized Spike protein from the WA1/2020 strain and has recently demonstrated protective efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in humans in multiple geographic regions, including in South Africa where 95% of sequenced viruses in COVID-19 cases were the B.1.351 variant3. Here we show that Ad26.COV2.S elicits humoral and cellular immune responses that cross-react with the B.1.351 variant and protects against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Ad26.COV2.S induced lower binding and neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 as compared with WA1/2020 but elicited CD8 and CD4 T cell responses that were comparable against WA1/2020, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P.1, and CAL.20C variants. B.1.351 infection of sham control rhesus macaques resulted in higher levels of virus replication in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs than did WA1/2020 infection. Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against both WA1/2020 and B.1.351, although we observed higher levels of virus in vaccinated animals following B.1.351 challenge. These data demonstrate that Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Our findings have important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

  // Effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, and Anakinra for critically ill patients with COVID-19 The REMAP-CAP COVID-19 Immune Modulation Therapy Domain Randomized Clinical Trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.21259133
  ref 'Derde_et_al_06_22_2021
    head = We evaluated four immunomodulatory agents in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult participants with COVID-19 were randomized to receive tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakinra, or standard care (control). In addition, a small group (n=21) of participants were randomized to interferon-β1a.

    > Background
      The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab improves outcomes in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effectiveness of other immune modulating agents is unclear.

    > Methods
      We evaluated four immunomodulatory agents in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult participants with COVID-19 were randomized to receive tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakinra, or standard care (control). In addition, a small group (n=21) of participants were randomized to interferon-β1a. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial used a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers for superiority, equivalence or futility.

    > Results
      Statistical triggers for equivalence between tocilizumab and sarilumab; and for inferiority of anakinra to the other active interventions were met at a planned adaptive analysis. Of the 2274 critically ill participants enrolled, 972 were assigned to tocilizumab, 485 to sarilumab, 378 to anakinra and 418 to control. Median organ support-free days were 7 (interquartile range [IQR] –1, 16), 9 (IQR –1, 17), 0 (IQR – 1, 15) and 0 (IQR –1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakinra and control, respectively. Median adjusted odds ratios were 1.46 (95%CrI 1.13, 1.87), 1.50 (95%CrI 1.13, 2.00), and 0.99 (95%CrI 0.74, 1.35) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra, yielding 99.8%, 99.8% and 46.6% posterior probabilities of superiority, respectively, compared to control. Median adjusted odds ratios for hospital survival were 1.42 (95%CrI 1.05,1.93), 1.51 (95%CrI 1.06, 2.20) and 0.97 (95%CrI 0.66, 1.40) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra respectively, compared to control, yielding 98.8%, 98.8% and 43.6% posterior probabilities of superiority, respectively, compared to control. All treatments appeared safe.

    > Conclusions
      In patients with severe COVID-19 receiving organ support, tocilizumab and sarilumab are similarly effective at improving survival and reducing duration of organ support. Anakinra is not effective in this population. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02735707)

  // Rapid displacement of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 by B.1.617.2 and P.1 in the United States
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.20.21259195

    head = We analyzed PCR testing results and viral sequencing results of samples collected across the United States,

    >  Abstract
      The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.617.2 displaced B.1.1.7 as the dominant variant in England and other countries. This study aimed to determine whether B.1.617.2 was also displacing B.1.1.7 in the United States. We analyzed PCR testing results and viral sequencing results of samples collected across the United States, and showed that B.1.1.7 was rapidly being displaced and is no longer responsible for the majority of new cases. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases that are B.1.1.7 dropped from 70% in April 2021 to 42% in just 6 weeks. Our analysis showed rapid growth of variants B.1.617.2 and P.1 as the primary drivers for this displacement. Currently, the growth rate of B.1.617.2 was higher than P.1 in the US (0.61 vs. 0.22), which is consistent with reports from other countries. Lastly, we showed that B.1.617.2 was growing faster in counties with a lower vaccination rate.

  // Epidemiology, clinical profile, management, and outcome of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis in 2826 patients in India – Collaborative OPAI-IJO Study on Mucormycosis in COVID-19 (COSMIC), Report 1
  doi: https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.IJO_1565_21
  ref 'Sen_et_al_06_30_2021
    head = This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19-associated ROCM managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India from January 1, 2020 to May 26, 2021.

    > Purpose
      COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) has reached epidemic proportion during India’s second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, with several risk factors being implicated in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to determine the patient demographics, risk factors including comorbidities, and medications used to treat COVID-19, presenting symptoms and signs, and the outcome of management.

    > Methods
      This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19-associated ROCM managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India from January 1, 2020 to May 26, 2021.

    > Results
      Of the 2826 patients, the states of Gujarat (22%) and Maharashtra (21%) reported the highest number of ROCM. The mean age of patients was 51.9 years with a male preponderance (71%). While 57% of the patients needed oxygen support for COVID-19 infection, 87% of the patients were treated with corticosteroids, (21% for > 10 days). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 78% of all patients. Most of the cases showed onset of symptoms of ROCM between day 10 and day 15 from the diagnosis of COVID-19, 56% developed within 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while 44% had delayed onset beyond 14 days. Orbit was involved in 72% of patients, with stage 3c forming the bulk (27%). Overall treatment included intravenous amphotericin B in 73%, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)/paranasal sinus (PNS) debridement in 56%, orbital exenteration in 15%, and both FESS/PNS debridement and orbital exenteration in 17%. Intraorbital injection of amphotericin B was administered in 22%. At final follow-up, mortality was 14%. Disease stage >3b had poorer prognosis. Paranasal sinus debridement and orbital exenteration reduced the mortality rate from 52% to 39% in patients with stage 4 disease with intracranial extension (p < 0.05).

    > Conclusion
      Corticosteroids and DM are the most important predisposing factors in the development of COVID-19-associated ROCM. COVID-19 patients must be followed up beyond recovery. Awareness of red flag symptoms and signs, high index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment with amphotericin B, aggressive surgical debridement of the PNS, and orbital exenteration, where indicated, are essential for successful outcome.

  // Assessing the Association Between Social Gatherings and COVID-19 Risk Using Birthdays
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2915
  ref 'Whaley_et_al_06_21_2021
    head = This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences.

    > Importance
      Many policies designed to stop the spread of COVID-19 address formal gatherings, such as workplaces and dining locations. Informal social gatherings are a potentially important mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but studying their role in transmission is challenged by data and methodological limitations; birthdays offer an opportunity to empirically quantify the potential role of small social gatherings in COVID-19 spread.

    > Objective
      To assess the association between social gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 transmission by studying whether COVID-19 rates increase after birthdays in a household.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences. The study also compared how birthday-associated infection rates differed by type of birthday (eg, child vs adult birthday, or a milestone birthday such as a 50th birthday), county-level precipitation on the Saturday of each week (which could move gatherings indoors), political leanings in the county, and state shelter-in-place policies.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Household-level COVID-19 infection.

    > Results
      Among the 2.9 million households in the study, in the top decile of counties in COVID-19 prevalence, households with a birthday in the 2 weeks prior had 8.6 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 6.6-10.7 per 10 000 individuals) compared with households without a birthday in the 2 weeks prior, a relative increase of 31% above the county-level prevalence of 27.8 cases per 10 000 individuals, vs 0.9 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 0.6-1.3 per 10 000 individuals) in the fifth decile (P < .001 for interaction). Households in the tenth decile of COVID-19 prevalence had an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses of 15.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 11.7-19.9 per 10 000 persons) after a child birthday, compared with an increase of 5.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 3.7-7.9 per 10 000 persons) among households with an adult birthday (P < .001 in a test of interactions). No differences were found by milestone birthdays, county political leaning, precipitation, or shelter-in-place policies.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      This cross-sectional study suggests that birthdays, which likely correspond with social gatherings and celebrations, were associated with increased rates of diagnosed COVID-19 infection within households in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence.

  ref 'Borobia_et_al_06_25_2021
    head = We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial on adults aged 18–60 years, vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1-S 8–12 weeks before screening, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 676 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either BNT162b2 (0·3 mL) via a single intramuscular injection (intervention group) or continue observation (control group) at five university hospitals in Spain

    > Background
      To date, no immunological data on COVID-19 heterologous vaccination schedules in humans have been reported. We assessed the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech, Mainz, Germany) administered as second dose in participants primed with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca, Oxford, UK).

    > Methods
      We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial on adults aged 18–60 years, vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1-S 8–12 weeks before screening, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either BNT162b2 (0·3 mL) via a single intramuscular injection (intervention group) or continue observation (control group). The primary outcome was 14-day immunogenicity, measured by immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody functionality was assessed using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay, and cellular immune response using an interferon-γ immunoassay. The safety outcome was 7-day reactogenicity, measured as solicited local and systemic adverse events. The primary analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 and who had at least one efficacy evaluation after baseline. The safety analysis included all participants who received BNT162b2. This study is registered with EudraCT (2021-001978-37) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04860739), and is ongoing.

    > Findings
      Between April 24 and 30, 2021, 676 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=450) or control group (n=226) at five university hospitals in Spain (mean age 44 years [SD 9]; 382 [57%] women and 294 [43%] men). 663 (98%) participants (n=441 intervention, n=222 control) completed the study up to day 14. In the intervention group, geometric mean titres of RBD antibodies increased from 71·46 BAU/mL (95% CI 59·84–85·33) at baseline to 7756·68 BAU/mL (7371·53–8161·96) at day 14 (p<0·0001). IgG against trimeric spike protein increased from 98·40 BAU/mL (95% CI 85·69–112·99) to 3684·87 BAU/mL (3429·87–3958·83). The interventional:control ratio was 77·69 (95% CI 59·57–101·32) for RBD protein and 36·41 (29·31–45·23) for trimeric spike protein IgG. Reactions were mild (n=1210 [68%]) or moderate (n=530 [30%]), with injection site pain (n=395 [88%]), induration (n=159 [35%]), headache (n=199 [44%]), and myalgia (n=194 [43%]) the most commonly reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported.

    > Interpretation
      BNT162b2 given as a second dose in individuals prime vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S induced a robust immune response, with an acceptable and manageable reactogenicity profile.

    head = We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 22, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.

    > Background
      We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients.

    > Methods
      Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 22, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed. with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology.

    > Results
      Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. COVID-19 disease severity was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE) or LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI −0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (all outcomes: low QoE). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM.

    > Conclusions
      In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have an effect on AEs or severe AEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107058
  ref 'Thompson_et_al_06_30_2021
    head = We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 3975 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers over 17 weeks in six U.S. states. From December 14, 2020, to April 10, 2021, the participants completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing by providing mid-turbinate nasal swabs for qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR analysis.

    > Background
      Information is limited regarding the effectiveness of the two-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) in preventing infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and in attenuating coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) when administered in real-world conditions.

    > Methods
      We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 3975 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers. From December 14, 2020, to April 10, 2021, the participants completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing by providing mid-turbinate nasal swabs for qualitative and quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The formula for calculating vaccine effectiveness was 100%×(1−hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), with adjustments for the propensity to be vaccinated, study site, occupation, and local viral circulation.

    > Results
      SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 participants (5%), of whom 5 were fully vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 2), 11 partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2), and 156 unvaccinated; the 32 participants with indeterminate vaccination status (<14 days after dose 1) were excluded. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76 to 97) with full vaccination and 81% (95% CI, 64 to 90) with partial vaccination. Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mean viral RNA load was 40% lower (95% CI, 16 to 57) in partially or fully vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants. In addition, the risk of febrile symptoms was 58% lower (relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.98) and the duration of illness was shorter, with 2.3 fewer days spent sick in bed (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7).

    > Conclusions
      Authorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age adults in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered in real-world conditions, and the vaccines attenuated the viral RNA load, risk of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among those who had breakthrough infection despite vaccination.

  // Thrombocytopenia and splenic platelet directed immune responses after intravenous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration

    head = We employ in vitro and in vivo models to characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity.

    > Summary
      Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are based on a range of novel vaccine platforms, with adenovirus-based approaches (like ChAdOx1 nCov-19) being one of them. Recently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is characterized by low platelet counts, clot formation at unusual anatomic sites and platelet-activating PF4-polyanion antibodies reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we employ in vitro and in vivo models to characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity. We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. After intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the marginal zone and follicles. This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets. Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.

    quote !a = Our data provide first experimental support for the potential sequence of events that could lead to TTS in some patients: Thrombocytopenia might be a result of accidental intravenous vaccine injection with ensuing platelet-adenovirus aggregation, which in turn triggers platelet activation and subsequent splenic clearance. This process is antibody independent and most likely clinically inapparent.

    / June, 2021 - bioRxiv
    quote !b = Phagocytosis and processing of platelet-adenovirus aggregates by professional phagocytes then creates a cross-reactive immune response, which culminates in the delayed emergence of platelet-binding-antibodies. These platelet-binding-antibodies might induce a second wave of clinically apparent thrombocytopenia through platelet activation or opsonization. In fact, pro-thrombotic antibodies present in heparin induced thrombocytopenia Type II, and platelet opsonization with antibodies is a typical feature of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Antibodies targeting platelets might shift these platelets towards a more thrombotic phenotype, which then leads to thrombosis in individuals with additional risk factors, including female sex, smoking or contraception.

  // Safety and Efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107659
  ref 'Heath_et_al_06_30_2021
    head = In this phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 33 sites in the United Kingdom, we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart.

    > Background
      Early clinical data from studies of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (Novavax), a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that contains the full-length spike glycoprotein of the prototype strain plus Matrix-M adjuvant, showed that the vaccine was safe and associated with a robust immune response in healthy adult participants. Additional data were needed regarding the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of this vaccine in a larger population.

    > Methods
      In this phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 33 sites in the United Kingdom, we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was virologically confirmed mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically negative at baseline.

    > Results
      A total of 15,187 participants underwent randomization, and 14,039 were included in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants, 27.9% were 65 years of age or older, and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10 participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group, with a symptom onset of at least 7 days after the second injection, for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2 to 94.6). No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection were reported, all of which were in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis showed an efficacy of 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.5) against non-B.1.1.7 variants. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups.

    > Conclusions
      A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant. (Funded by Novavax; EudraCT number, 2020-004123-16. opens in new tab.)

  ref 'Han_et_al_06_28_2021
    head = A double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy children and adolescents aged 3–17 years old at Hebei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zanhuang (Hebei, China).



    > Background
      A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for children and adolescents will play an important role in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in children and adolescents aged 3–17 years.

    > Methods
      We did a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy children and adolescents aged 3–17 years old at Hebei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zanhuang (Hebei, China). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history were excluded. Vaccine (in 0·5 mL aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) or aluminum hydroxide only (alum only, control) was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (day 0 and day 28). We did a phase 1 trial in 72 participants with an age de-escalation in three groups and dose-escalation in two blocks (1·5 μg or 3·0 μg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (3:1) by means of block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or alum only. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) by means of block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 μg or 3·0 μg per dose, or alum only. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint assessed in the per-protocol population was seroconversion rate of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2 at 28 days after the second injection. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04551547.

    > Findings
      Between Oct 31, 2020, and Dec 2, 2020, 72 participants were enrolled in phase 1, and between Dec 12, 2020, and Dec 30, 2020, 480 participants were enrolled in phase 2. 550 participants received at least one dose of vaccine or alum only (n=71 for phase 1 and n=479 for phase 2; safety population). In the combined safety profile of phase 1 and phase 2, any adverse reactions within 28 days after injection occurred in 56 (26%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 63 (29%) of 217 in the 3·0 μg group, and 27 (24%) of 114 in the alum-only group, without significant difference (p=0·55). Most adverse reactions were mild and moderate in severity. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported event (73 [13%] of 550 participants), occurring in 36 (16%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 35 (16%) of 217 in the 3·0 μg group, and two (2%) in the alum-only group. As of June 12, 2021, only one serious adverse event of pneumonia has been reported in the alum-only group, which was considered unrelated to vaccination. In phase 1, seroconversion of neutralising antibody after the second dose was observed in 27 of 27 participants (100·0% [95% CI 87·2–100·0]) in the 1·5 μg group and 26 of 26 participants (100·0% [86·8-100·0]) in the 3·0 μg group, with the geometric mean titres of 55·0 (95% CI 38·9–77·9) and 117·4 (87·8–157·0). In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 180 of 186 participants (96·8% [93·1–98·8]) in the 1·5 μg group and 180 of 180 participants (100·0% [98·0–100·0]) in the 3·0 μg group, with the geometric mean titres of 86·4 (73·9–101·0) and 142·2 (124·7–162·1). There were no detectable antibody responses in the alum-only groups.

    > Interpretation
      CoronaVac was well tolerated and safe and induced humoral responses in children and adolescents aged 3–17 years. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3·0 μg dose were higher than those of the 1·5 μg dose. The results support the use of 3·0 μg dose with a two-immunisation schedule for further studies in children and adolescents.

  ref 'Turner_et_al_06_28_2021
    head = We examined antigen-specific B cell responses in peripheral blood (n=41) and draining lymph nodes (LNs) in 14 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene1.

    > Abstract
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are ~95% effective in preventing coronavirus disease 20191–5. The dynamics of antibody secreting plasmablasts (PBs) and germinal centre (GC) B cells induced by these vaccines in humans remain unclear. We examined antigen-specific B cell responses in peripheral blood (n=41) and draining lymph nodes (LNs) in 14 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene1. Circulating IgG- and IgA-secreting PBs targeting the S protein peaked one week after the second immunization then declined, becoming undetectable three weeks later. These PB responses preceded maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to an early circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who produced the most robust serologic responses. By examining fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of draining axillary LNs, we identified GC B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled after primary immunization. Remarkably, high frequencies of S-binding GC B cells and PBs were sustained in these draining LNs for at least twelve weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding GC B cell-derived monoclonal antibodies predominantly targeted the receptor binding domain of the S protein, with fewer clones binding to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. The latter cross-reactive B cell clones had higher levels of somatic hypermutation compared to those that only recognized SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting a memory B cell origin. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity.

  // Safety and immunogenicity report from the Com-COV study – A single-blind randomised non inferiority trial comparing heterologous and homologous prime-boost schedules with an 3 adenoviral vectored and mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
  doi: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3874014
  ref 'Liu_et_al_06_25_2021
    head = We report the immunogenicity of these heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAd, Vaxzevria, Astrazeneca) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT, Comirnaty, Pfizer). Adults ≥ 50 years, including those with well-controlled comorbidities, were randomised across eight groups to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT or BNT/ChAd, administered at 28- or 84-day intervals.

    > Background
      Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation, however we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAd, Vaxzevria, Astrazeneca) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT, Comirnaty, Pfizer) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here we report the immunogenicity of these schedules.

    > Methods
      Com-COV (ISRCTN: 69254139, EudraCT: 2020-005085-33) is a participant-blind, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Adults ≥ 50 years, including those with well-controlled comorbidities, were randomised across eight groups to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT or BNT/ChAd, administered at 28- or 84-day intervals. The primary endpoint is geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG levels (ELISA) at one-month post boost between heterologous and homologous schedules given the same prime vaccine. We tested non-inferiority of GMR using a margin of 0.63. The primary analysis was on a per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were performed amongst participants receiving at least one dose of study vaccines.

    > Findings
      In February 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 with a 28-day prime-boost interval whose results are reported in this paper. Participant mean age was 57.8 years, 45.8% were female, and 25.3% from ethnic minorities. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of day 28 post-boost SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12,906 ELU/ml) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1,392 ELU/ml) with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 9.2 (one-sided 97.5% CI: 7.5, ∞). In participants primed with BNT, we failed to show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, GMC 7,133 ELU/ml) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, GMC 14,080 ELU/ml) with a GMR of 0.51 (one-sided 97.5% CI: 0.43, ∞). Geometric mean of T cell response at 28 days post boost in the ChAd/BNT group was 185 SFC/106 PBMCs (spot forming cells/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) compared to 50, 80 and 99 SFC/106 PBMCs for ChAd/ChAd, BNT/BNT, and BNT/ChAd, respectively. There were four serious adverse events across all groups, none of which were considered related to immunisation.

    > Interpretation
      Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the GMCs of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. These data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.

  ref 'Davis_et_al_06_28_2021
    head = We examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines.


    > Abstract
      Vaccines are proving to be highly effective in controlling hospitalisation and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection but the emergence of viral variants with novel antigenic profiles threatens to diminish their efficacy. Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here, we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals, the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351 (South African) variant (6.29-fold reduction) that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2, conferred reductions in titre of 7.77, 11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses, the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69, 4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs, and others, demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly, booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity.

    > Results
      Ten lactating healthcare workers aged 32.5 years (range 29 – 42) were recruited, with 40 human milk samples collected and analysed. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA was predominant in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine. The sharpest rise in antibody production was 3 -7 days after dose two of the BNT162b2. Vaccine mRNA was detected only on rare occasions, at a maximum concentration of 2 ng/mL.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this cohort of ten lactating mothers following BNT162b2 vaccination, nine (90%) produced SARS-CoV-2 IgA, and ten (100%) produced IgG in human milk with minimal amounts of vaccine mRNA. Lactating individuals should continue  breastfeeding in an uninterrupted manner after receiving mRNA vaccination for SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      The Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant has spread quickly since first being identified. To better understand its epidemiological characteristics and impact, we utilize multiple datasets and comprehensive model-inference methods to reconstruct COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in India, where Delta first emerged. Using model-inference estimates from March 2020 to May 2021, we estimate the Delta variant can escape adaptive immunity induced by prior wildtype infection roughly half of the time and is around 60% more infectious than wildtype SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our analysis suggests that the recent case decline in India was likely due to implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and weather conditions less conducive for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during March – May, rather than high population immunity. Model projections show infections could resurge as India enters its monsoon season, beginning June, if intervention measures are lifted prematurely.

  // Patients With Acute Myocarditis Following mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.2828
  ref 'Kim_et_al_06_29_2021
    head = In the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30, 2021, 7 patients with acute myocarditis were identified, of which 4 occurred within 5 days of COVID-19 vaccination.

    > Importance
      Vaccine-associated myocarditis is an unusual entity that has been described for the smallpox vaccine, but only anecdotal case reports have been described for other vaccines. Whether COVID-19 vaccination may be linked to the occurrence of myocarditis is unknown.

    > Objective
      To describe a group of 7 patients with acute myocarditis over 3 months, 4 of whom had recent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      All patients referred for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging at Duke University Medical Center were asked to participate in a prospective outcomes registry. Two searches of the registry database were performed: first, to identify patients with acute myocarditis for the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30 for 2017 through 2021, and second, to identify all patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis for the past 20 years. Once patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis were identified, data available in the registry were supplemented by additional data collection from the electronic health record and a telephone interview.

    > Exposures
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Occurrence of acute myocarditis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.

    > Results
      In the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30, 2021, 7 patients with acute myocarditis were identified, of which 4 occurred within 5 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Three were younger male individuals (age, 23-36 years) and 1 was a 70-year-old female individual. All 4 had received the second dose of an mRNA vaccine (2 received mRNA-1273 [Moderna], and 2 received BNT162b2 [Pfizer]). All presented with severe chest pain, had biomarker evidence of myocardial injury, and were hospitalized. Coincident testing for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses provided no alternative explanation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were typical for myocarditis, including regional dysfunction, late gadolinium enhancement, and elevated native T1 and T2.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this study, magnetic resonance imaging findings were found to be consistent with acute myocarditis in 7 patients; 4 of whom had preceding COVID-19 vaccination. Further investigation is needed to determine associations of COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis.

    > Importance
      Myocarditis has been reported with COVID-19 but is not clearly recognized as a possible adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination.

    > Objective
      To describe myocarditis presenting after COVID-19 vaccination within the Military Health System.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      This retrospective case series studied patients within the US Military Health System who experienced myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination between January and April 2021. Patients who sought care for chest pain following COVID-19 vaccination and were subsequently diagnosed with clinical myocarditis were included.

    > Exposure
      Receipt of a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine between January 1 and April 30, 2021.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Clinical diagnosis of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in the absence of other identified causes.

    > Results
      A total of 23 male patients (22 currently serving in the military and 1 retiree; median [range] age, 25 [20-51] years) presented with acute onset of marked chest pain within 4 days after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. All military members were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second dose of an appropriately spaced 2-dose series. All patients had significantly elevated cardiac troponin levels. Among 8 patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging within the acute phase of illness, all had findings consistent with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. Additional testing did not identify other etiologies for myocarditis, including acute COVID-19 and other infections, ischemic injury, or underlying autoimmune conditions. All patients received brief supportive care and were recovered or recovering at the time of this report. The military administered more than 2.8 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in this period. While the observed number of myocarditis cases was small, the number was higher than expected among male military members after a second vaccine dose.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this case series, myocarditis occurred in previously healthy military patients with similar clinical presentations following receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Further surveillance and evaluation of this adverse event following immunization is warranted. Potential for rare vaccine-related adverse events must be considered in the context of the well-established risk of morbidity, including cardiac injury, following COVID-19 infection.

  // Telmisartan for treatment of Covid-19 patients: An open multicenter randomized clinical trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100962
  ref 'Duarte_et_al_06_18_2021
    head = This is a parallel-group, randomized, two-arm, open-label, adaptive, multicenter superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. A total of 162 patients were randomized.

    > Background
      Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as telmisartan, have been postulated to treat Covid-19-induced lung inflammation.

    > Methods
      This is a parallel-group, randomized, two-arm, open-label, adaptive, multicenter superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants included patients from 18 years of age hospitalized with Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset enrolled at a university and a community hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Exclusion criteria included prior intensive care unit (ICU) admission and use of ARBs/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at randomization. Control arm received standard care alone and treatment arm telmisartan 80 mg twice daily for 14 days. Primary outcomes were C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Secondary outcomes included time to discharge within 15 days, admission to ICU and death at 15- and 30-days. NCT04355936 (Completed).

    > Findings
      A pragmatic decision to end the study before the third interim analysis was made on Oct. 30th due to sharp reduction in recruitment. A total of 162 patients were randomized. 158 patients enrolled between May 14 and October 30 2020, were included in the analysis, 80 in the standard care and 78 in the telmisartan added to standard care group. Baseline absolute CRP serum levels were 5.53 ± 6.19 mg/dL (95% CI 6.91 to 4.15, n = 80) and 9.04 ± 7.69 (95% CI 9.04 to 10.82, n = 74) in the standard care and telmisartan added to standard care groups, respectively. Day 5 control-group CRP levels were 6.06 ± 6.95 mg/dL (95% CI 7.79–4.35, n = 66) while telmisartan group were 3.83 ± 5.08 mg/dL (95% CI 5.08–2.59, n = 66, p = 0.038). Day 8 CRP levels were 6.30 ± 8.19 mg/dL (95% CI 8.79–3.81, n = 44) and 2.37 ± 3.47 mg/dL (95% CI 3.44–1.30, n = 43, p = 0.0098) in the control and telmisartan groups, respectively (all values expressed as mean ± SD). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that telmisartan-treated patients had a lower median time-to-discharge (control=15 days; telmisartan=9 days). Death by day 30 was reduced in the telmisartan-treated group (control 22.54%, 16/71; telmisartan 4.29%, 3/70 participants; p = 0.0023). Composite ICU, mechanical ventilation or death was reduced by telmisartan treatment at days 15 and 30. No adverse events were reported.

    > Interpretation
      Our study suggests that the ARB telmisartan, a widely used antihypertensive drug, is safe and could reduce morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients infected with SARS -CoV-2 by anti-inflammatory effects. Further studies employing telmisartan are needed for confirmation of our results and to define its true therapeutic value as a tool against Covid-19.

  ref 'Douaud_et_al_06_15_2021
    head = We studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between their two scans.

    > Abstract
      There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19, some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative, gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit. Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|>3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory and gustatory pathways.

    head = We demonstrated that the B.1.617 lineage has acquired a unique strategy to facilitate infection and evade antiviral immunity. We show that the B.1.617 variants are highly fusogenic and form prominent syncytia.



    > Abstract
      During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a variety of mutations have been accumulated in the viral genome, and at least five variants of concerns (VOCs) have been considered as the hazardous SARS-CoV-2 variants to the human society. The newly emerging VOC, the B.1.617.2 lineage (delta variant), closely associates with a huge COVID-19 surge in India in Spring 2021. However, its virological property remains unclear. Here, we show that the B.1.617 variants are highly fusogenic and form prominent syncytia. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that the P681R mutation in the spike protein is highly conserved in this lineage. Although the P681R mutation decreases viral infectivity, this mutation confers the neutralizing antibody resistance. Notably, we demonstrate that the P681R mutation facilitates the furin-mediated spike cleavage and enhances and accelerates cell-cell fusion. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark characterizing the virological phenotype of this newest VOC, which may associate with viral pathogenicity.

    > Abstract
      Improved understanding of the effects of meteorological conditions on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19 disease, is needed. Here, we estimate the relationship between air temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 2669 U.S. counties with abundant reported cases from March 15 to December 31, 2020. Specifically, we quantify the associations of daily mean temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation with daily estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (Rt) and calculate the fraction of Rt attributable to these meteorological conditions. Lower air temperature (within the 20–40 °C range), lower specific humidity, and lower ultraviolet radiation were significantly associated with increased Rt. The fraction of Rt attributable to temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation were 3.73% (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI]: 3.66–3.76%), 9.35% (95% eCI: 9.27–9.39%), and 4.44% (95% eCI: 4.38–4.47%), respectively. In total, 17.5% of Rt was attributable to meteorological factors. The fractions attributable to meteorological factors generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties. Our findings indicate that cold and dry weather and low levels of ultraviolet radiation are moderately associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, with humidity playing the largest role.

  // Casirivimab and imdevimab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258542
  ref 'Horby_et_al_06_16_2021
    head = In this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021), 9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, including 3153 seronegative patients, 5272 seropositive patients and 1360 patients with unknown baseline antibody status.



    > Background
      REGEN-COV is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab) that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

    > Methods
      In this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus a single dose of REGEN-COV 8g (casirivimab 4g and imdevimab 4g) by intravenous infusion (REGEN-COV group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed first among patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation (seronegative) and then in the overall population.

    > Findings
      Between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, including 3153 (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360 (14%) patients with unknown baseline antibody status. In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 451 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.91; p=0.0010). In an analysis involving all randomised patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 944 (20%) of 4839 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 1026 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.86-1.03; p=0.17). The proportional effect of REGEN-COV on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity = 0.001).

    > Interpretation
      In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV) reduced 28-day mortality among patients who were seronegative at baseline.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2021.1936818
  ref 'Castelnuovo_et_al_06_15_2021
    head = We reviewed published literature for evidence of an association between HCQ (with or without azithromycin (AZM)) and total mortality in COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 cohort studies (N=41,339 patients) and 11 randomized clinical trials (RCTs; N=8,709) were found.


    > Background
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was proposed as potential treatment for COVID-19, but its association with mortality is unclear. We reviewed published literature for evidence of an association between HCQ (with or without azithromycin (AZM)) and total mortality in COVID-19 patients.

    > Methods
      Articles were retrieved until April 29th, 2021 by searching in seven databases. Data were combined using the general-variance-based method.

    > Results
      A total of 25 cohort studies (N=41,339 patients) and 11 randomized clinical trials (RCTs; N=8,709) were found. The use of HCQ was not associated with mortality in meta-analysis of RCTs (pooled risk ratio (PRR): 1.08, 95%CI: 0.97-1.20; I2=0%), but it was associated with 20% lower mortality risk (PRR=0.80, 95%CI: 0.69-0.93; I2=80%) in pooling of cohort studies. The negative association with mortality was mainly apparent by pooling cohort studies that used lower doses of HCQ (≤400 mg/day; PRR=0.69, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87). Use of HCQ+AZM (11 studies) was associated with 25% non-statistically significant lower mortality risk (PPR=0.75; 0.51-1.10; P=0.15). Use of HCQ was not associated with severe adverse events (PRR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.88-1.44; I2=0%).

    > Conclusions
      HCQ use was not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients in pooling results from RCTs (high level of certainty of evidence), but it was associated with 20% mortality reduction when findings from observational studies were combined (low level of certainty of evidence). The reduction of mortality was mainly apparent in observational studies where lower doses of HCQ were used. These findings might help disentangling the debate on HCQ use in COVID-19.

  // Distinct SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Elicited by Natural Infection and mRNA Vaccination

    head = We compared antibody responses induced afterSARS-CoV-2 natural exposure with the responses induced by the mRNA vaccines. We analyzed data from two ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological surveys in Orange County, CA., between April 2020 and March 2021.


    > Abstract
      We analyzed data from two ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological surveys in Orange County, CA., between April 2020 and March 2021. A total of 8,476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after an aggressive mRNA vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing 10 SARS-CoV-2 antigens, 4 SARS, 3 MERS, 12 Common CoV, and 8 Influenza antigens. Twenty-six percent of 3,347 specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The Ab response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length spike and the spike S2 domain. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and there was no cross-reactivity against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. An aggressive mRNA vaccination campaign at the UCI Medical Center started on December 16, 2020 and 6,724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. Seroprevalence increased from 13% in December to 79% in January, 93% in February and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced much higher Ab levels especially against the RBD domain and significant cross-reactivity against SARS RBD and S1 was also observed. Nucleocapsid protein Abs can be used to distinguish individuals in a population of vaccinees to classify those who have been previously infected and those who have not, because nucleocapsid is not in the vaccine. Previously infected individuals developed higher Ab titers to the vaccine than those who have not been previously exposed. These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much stronger and broader Ab response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  // High-affinity, neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be made in the absence of T follicular helper cells
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.10.447982
  ref 'Chen_et_al_06_11_2021
    head = While protective antibodies are usually generated through Tfh/GC-dependent pathways, it is unclear what happens to the antibody response when these structures are disrupted by virus-induced inflammation.

    > Abstract
      T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are the conventional drivers of protective, germinal center (GC)-based antiviral antibody responses. However, loss of Tfh cells and GCs has been observed in patients with severe COVID-19. As T cell-B cell interactions and immunoglobulin class switching still occur in these patients, non-canonical pathways of antibody production may be operative during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that both Tfh-dependent and -independent antibodies were induced against SARS-CoV-2 as well as influenza A virus. Tfh-independent responses were mediated by a population we call lymph node (LN)-Th1 cells, which remain in the LN and interact with B cells outside of GCs to promote high-affinity but broad-spectrum antibodies. Strikingly, antibodies generated in the presence and absence of Tfh cells displayed similar neutralization potency against homologous SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.351 variant of concern. These data support a new paradigm for the induction of B cell responses during viral infection that enables effective, neutralizing antibody production to complement traditional GCs and even compensate for GCs damaged by viral inflammation.

    > Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the pronounced vulnerability of the elderly and chronically-ill to SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity and mortality. Cellular senescence contributes to inflammation, multiple chronic diseases, and age-related dysfunction, but effects on responses to viral infection are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cells (SnC) become hyper-inflammatory in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-1, increasing expression of viral entry proteins and reducing anti-viral gene expression in non-SnCs through a paracrine mechanism. Old mice acutely infected with pathogens that included a SARS-CoV-2-related mouse β-coronavirus experienced increased senescence and inflammation with nearly 100% mortality. Targeting SnCs using senolytic drugs before or after pathogen exposure significantly reduced mortality, cellular senescence, and inflammatory markers and increased anti-viral antibodies. Thus, reducing the SnC burden in diseased or aged individuals should enhance resilience and reduce mortality following viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.

    quote !b = Both the pharmacological (e.g., senolytics Fisetin or D+Q) and genetic (INK-ATTAC) clearance of SnC yielded significant delay, or in the case of the former reduction in mortality in both old male and female mice.

    quote !c = Adverse outcomes were attenuated when the senolytic, Fisetin, was administered either prior to (a preventative measure) or after (a therapeutic intervention) NME exposure. The senolytics Fisetin and D+Q were more effective at delaying mortality than genetic ablation of SnC in the INK-ATTAC mice, consistent with the fact that the latter only removes SnC expressing high levels of p16Ink4a, not p16-low or -negative SnC.


    / June, 2021 - Science
    quote !d = SnC burden is increased in old and young mice exposed to NME and, if it persists, could lead to additional co-morbidities. However, the magnitude of senescence in young animals appears not to reach a threshold that compromises survival. Thus, it is possible that senolytic treatment could be beneficial to COVID-19 survivors for improving long-term outcomes and suggests that monitoring expression of senescence markers in this patient population would be advantageous.

    / June, 2021 - Science
    quote !e = It is notable that it was not necessary to reduce senescence markers to the level of young individuals to dramatically improve survival. This supports the possibility that there is a threshold beyond which senescent cell burden is deleterious and illustrates that, unlike for cancer cells, not every SnC needs to be eliminated to have a beneficial effect.

    / June, 2021 - Science
    quote !f = A high SnC burden in the elderly or those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, or chronic lung disease likely can interfere with the ability of the immune system to induce a strong B and T cell response to novel antigens. We found that intermittent senolytic treatment improved the development of an anti-MHV antibody response. This could be because the old mice survive long enough to mount a healthy response analogous to younger mice, or because dampening the SASP/inflammation improved immune cell function, or both. However, our preclinical data suggest that senolytics could improve the response of the elderly to vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and others.


    / June, 2021 - Science
    quote !g = The immediate implication of these studies is that senolytics could have clinical application for attenuating mortality and other adverse outcomes in the elderly and those with comorbidities who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, based upon our findings in LPS-treated SnCs and aged mice, senolytics may be of potential therapeutic use for elderly persons stricken by bacterial infections. In addition, our data support the view that targeting pillars of aging and, in particular, cellular senescence, can improve resilience of the elderly in the face of viral pathogens.

    / June, 2021 - Science
    quote !h = For the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future pandemics, rapalogs, glucocorticoids, and metformin, all of which inhibit the SASP, might lessen SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm and improve outcomes. However, unlike senolytics, some of these drugs may need to be administered continuously or at least more frequently, adding to off-target and side effects, especially in elderly patients with co-morbidities and polypharmacy.

  // Safety, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of a COVID-19 Vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) Co-administered With Seasonal Influenza Vaccines
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.21258556
  ref 'Heath_et_al_06_03_2021
    head = A sub-study on influenza vaccine co-administration was conducted as part of the phase 3 randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373. Sub-study participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than main study participants.

    > Background
      The safety and immunogenicity profile of COVID-19 vaccines when administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccines has not yet been reported.

    > Methods
      A sub-study on influenza vaccine co-administration was conducted as part of the phase 3 randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373. The first ∼400 participants meeting main study entry criteria and with no contraindications to influenza vaccination were invited to join the sub-study. After randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive NVX-CoV2373 (n=217) or placebo (n=214), sub-study participants received an age-appropriate, licensed, open-label influenza vaccine with dose 1 of NVX-CoV2373. Reactogenicity was evaluated via electronic diary for 7 days post-vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), medically-attended AEs (MAAEs), and serious AEs (SAEs). Influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG assays were performed. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed. Comparisons were made between sub-study and main study participants.

    > Findings
      Sub-study participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than main study participants. Reactogenicity events more common in the co-administration group included tenderness (70.1% vs 57.6%) or pain (39.7% vs 29.3%) at injection site, fatigue (27.7% vs 19.4%), and muscle pain (28.3% vs 21.4%). Rates of unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, and SAEs were low and balanced between the two groups. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response, while a reduction in antibody responses to the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was noted. Vaccine efficacy in the sub-study was 87.5% (95% CI: -0.2, 98.4) while efficacy in the main study was 89.8% (95% CI: 79.7, 95.5).

    > Interpretation
      This is the first study to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccines. The results suggest concomitant vaccination may be a viable immunisation strategy.

  // Probable aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a poorly ventilated courtroom

    head = This study examines a case of clustering that occurred in a courtroom, in which 5 of the 10 participants were tested positive within days of the hearing. This case study contributes to the growing body evidence highlighting possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosol.

    > Abstract
      There is increasing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosol; the number of cases of transmission via this route reported in the literature remains however limited. This study examines a case of clustering that occurred in a courtroom, in which 5 of the 10 participants were tested positive within days of the hearing. Ventilation loss rates and dispersion of fine aerosols were measured through CO2 injections and lactose aerosol generation. Emission rate and influencing parameters were then computed using a well-mixed dispersion model. The emission rate from the index case was estimated at 130 quanta h−1 (interquartile (97–155 quanta h−1). Measured lactose concentrations in the room were found relatively homogenous (n = 8, mean 336 µg m−3, SD = 39 µg m−3). Air renewal was found to play an important role for event durations greater than 0.5 h and loss rate below 2–3 h−1. The estimated emission rate suggests a high viral load in the index case and/or a high SARS-CoV-2 infection coefficient. High probabilities of infection in similar indoor situations are related to unfavorable conditions of ventilation, emission rate, and event durations. Source emission control appears essential to reduce aerosolized infection in events lasting longer than 0.5 h.

    head = We report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines.


    > Abstract
      Over one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several excellent vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies1. Here we report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines. In the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response, and as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern that are comparable to or greater than neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 achieved by vaccination of naive individuals. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover, and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in variants of concern. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand dramatically after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

    head = We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of this mRNA vaccine. We measured several serological and cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve or previously-infected individuals.

    > Abstract
      The standard dosing of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine validated in clinical trials includes two doses administered three weeks apart. While the decision by some public health authorities to space the doses because of limiting supply has raised concerns about vaccine efficacy, data indicate that a single dose is up to 90% effective starting 14 days after its administration. We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of this mRNA vaccine. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine at this time point, no neutralizing activity were elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals. However, we detected strong anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and Spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular responses dominated by the CD4+ T cell component. A single dose of this mRNA vaccine to individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 boosted all humoral and T cell responses measured, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Neutralizing responses were increased in both potency and breadth, with distinctive capacity to neutralize emerging variant strains. Our results highlight the importance of vaccinating uninfected and previously-infected individuals and shed new light into the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. They also provide support to spacing the doses of two-vaccine regimens to vaccinate a larger pool of the population in the context of vaccine scarcity against SARS-CoV-2.

  ref 'Chung_et_al_06_11_2021
    head = This cross-sectional study used a respiratory virus surveillance platform in persons of all ages to detect community COVID-19 cases from March 23 to November 9, 2020.


    > Importance
      The association between COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in children living in the community is not well understood.

    > Objective
      To characterize symptoms of pediatric COVID-19 in the community and analyze the association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as approximated by cycle threshold (Ct) values, in children and adults.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      This cross-sectional study used a respiratory virus surveillance platform in persons of all ages to detect community COVID-19 cases from March 23 to November 9, 2020. A population-based convenience sample of children younger than 18 years and adults in King County, Washington, who enrolled online for home self-collection of upper respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were included.

    > Exposures
      Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from participant-collected samples.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Ct values stratified by age and symptoms.

    > Results
      Among 555 SARS-CoV-2–positive participants (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [20.1] years; 320 were female [57.7%]), 47 of 123 children (38.2%) were asymptomatic compared with 31 of 432 adults (7.2%). When symptomatic, fewer symptoms were reported in children compared with adults (mean [SD], 1.6 [2.0] vs 4.5 [3.1]). Symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (which corresponded to higher viral RNA levels) than asymptomatic individuals (adjusted estimate for children, −3.0; 95% CI, −5.5 to −0.6; P = .02; adjusted estimate for adults, −2.9; 95% CI, −5.2 to −0.6; P = .01). The difference in mean Ct values was neither statistically significant between symptomatic children and symptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, −0.7; 95% CI, −2.2 to 0.9; P = .41) nor between asymptomatic children and asymptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, −0.6; 95% CI, −4.0 to 2.8; P = .74).

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this community-based cross-sectional study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as determined by Ct values, were significantly higher in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic individuals and no significant age-related differences were found. Further research is needed to understand the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and viral transmission.

    head = As part of ongoing diligence on coverage of variants by the BNT162b2 vaccine, we have engineered variant spike genes into the backbone of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate, and, using the gold standard PRNT50 assay, we have tested neutralization of the resulting viruses by a panel of BTN162b2-immunized human sera drawn 2 or 4 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 given three weeks apart.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve around the world, generating new variants that are of concern based on their potential for altered transmissibility, pathogenicity, and coverage by vaccines and therapeutics1–5. Here we report that 20 human sera, drawn 2 or 4 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2, neutralize engineered SARS-CoV-2 with a USA-WA1/2020 genetic background (a virus strain isolated in January 2020) and spike glycoproteins from the newly emerged B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, B.1.618 (all first identified in India) or B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria) lineages. Geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization titers against the variant viruses, particularly the B.1.617.1 variant, appear lower than the titer against USA-WA1/2020 virus, but all sera tested neutralize the variant viruses at titers of at least 40. The susceptibility of these newly emerged variants to BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited neutralization supports mass immunization as a central strategy to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across geographies.

  ref 'Milman_et_al_06_03_2021
    head = We analyzed vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities.

    > Abstract
      Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been vaccinated. The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer–BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.

    > Abstract
      Numerous reports document the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but there is limited information on its introduction before the identification of a local case. This may lead to incorrect assumptions when modeling viral origins and transmission. Here, we utilize a sample pooling strategy to screen for previously undetected SARS-CoV-2 in de-identified, respiratory pathogen-negative nasopharyngeal specimens from 3,040 patients across the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. The patients had been previously evaluated for respiratory symptoms or influenza-like illness during the first 10 weeks of 2020. We identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from specimens collected as early as 25 January 2020, and complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from multiple pools of samples collected between late February and early March, documenting an increase prior to the later surge. Our results provide evidence of sporadic SARS-CoV-2 infections a full month before both the first officially documented case and emergence of New York as a COVID-19 epicenter in March 2020.

    head = We generated AZD2816, a new ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine expressing B.1.351 spike protein and assessed the immunogenicity in mice. As priming of the immune response to the original wild-type spike protein may impact the ability to switch specificity of the response to B.1.351, we measured antibody and T cell responses after one or two doses of the original ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) followed by a single dose of AZD2816.

    > Abstract
      There is an ongoing global effort, to design, manufacture, and clinically assess vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Over the course of the ongoing pandemic a number of new SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates or variants of concern (VoC) have been identified containing mutations that negatively impact the role of neutralising antibodies. In this study we describe the generation and preclinical assessment of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine against the variant of concern B.1.351 (AZD2816). We demonstrate AZD2816 is immunogenic after a single dose and when used as a booster dose in animals primed with original vaccine AZD1222, we see no evidence of original antigenic sin but high titre antibodies against a number of variant spike proteins. In addition, neutralisation titres against B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), are induced in these boost regimens. These data support the ongoing clinical development and testing of this new variant vaccine.

  // Evidence for lack of transmission by close contact and surface touch in a restaurant outbreak of COVID-19
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.05.030
  ref 'Zhang_et_al_05_29_2021
    head = We examined video data related to a restaurant associated COVID-19 outbreak in Guangzhou. We observed more than 40,000 surface touches and 13,000 episodes of close contacts in the restaurant during the entire lunch duration. These data allowed us to analyse infection risk via both the fomite and close contact routes.

    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory disease that has become a global pandemic. Close contact plays an important role in infection spread, while fomite may also be a possible transmission route. Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified long-range airborne transmission as one of the important transmission routes although lack solid evidence.

    > Methods
      We examined video data related to a restaurant associated COVID-19 outbreak in Guangzhou. We observed more than 40,000 surface touches and 13,000 episodes of close contacts in the restaurant during the entire lunch duration. These data allowed us to analyse infection risk via both the fomite and close contact routes.

    > Results
      There is no significant correlation between the infection risk via both fomite and close contact routes among those who were not family members of the index case. We can thus rule out virus transmission via fomite contact and interpersonal close contact routes in the Guangzhou restaurant outbreak. The absence of a fomite route agrees with the COVID-19 literature.

    > Conclusions
      These results provide indirect evidence for the long-range airborne route dominating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the restaurant. We note that the restaurant was poorly ventilated, allowing for increasing airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration.

    quote !d = We note that the Guangzhou restaurant was poorly ventilated - the ventilation rate was only 0.75-1.04 L/s per person[16], which is much less than the Chinese (5 L/s per person) and ASHRAE (6-8 ACH per hour, 7.0-8.8 L/s per person in Guangzhou's restaurant) standard for restaurants. Low ventilation when there is an index patient results in the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 increasing over time. Thus, poor ventilation in the restaurant strengthens the case for the long-range airborne route dominating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in this restaurant.

    # / May, 2021 - Journal of Infection
    # quote !a = Our data shows that only 7 (out of 11,778) episodes of close contacts happened between diners from different tables. Therefore, cross infection risk via the close contact route between diners from different tables is very small. However, close contacts between diners and staff were frequent, and the infection risk for diners might have been greater if a staff person had been infected. Guangzhou had started the highest-emergency response to COVID-19 on 24 January, 2020, requiring staff in restaurants were required to wear a mask at all times indoors. However, the staff wore masks only 8.6% of the time.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 160 million people and resulted in more than 3.3 million deaths, and we still face many challenges in the rollout of vaccines. Here, we use the high-density microarray patch to deliver a SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit vaccine directly to the skin. We show the vaccine, dry-coated on the patch is thermostable, and delivery of spike via HD-MAP induced greater cellular and antibody immune responses, with serum able to potently neutralize clinically relevant isolates including those from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, a single dose of HD-MAP-delivered spike provided complete protection from a lethal virus challenge, demonstrating that HD-MAP delivery of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is superior to traditional needle-and-syringe vaccination and has the potential to greatly impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

  // SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell spread occurs rapidly and is insensitive to antibody neutralization

  ref 'Jackson_et_al_06_01_2021
    head = We visualized infection using time-lapse microscopy of a human lung cell line and used live virus neutralization to determine the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell spread to neutralizing antibodies.

    > Abstract
      Viruses increase the efficiency of close-range transmission between cells by manipulating cellular physiology and behavior, and SARS-CoV-2 uses cell fusion as one mechanism for cell-to-cell spread. Here we visualized infection using time-lapse microscopy of a human lung cell line and used live virus neutralization to determine the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell spread to neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly led to cell fusion, forming multinucleated cells with clustered nuclei which started to be detected at 6h post-infection. To compare sensitivity of cell-to-cell spread to neutralization, we infected either with cell-free virus or with single infected cells expressing on their surface the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We tested two variants of SARS-CoV-2: B.1.117 containing only the D614G substitution, and the escape variant B.1.351. We used the much smaller area of single infected cells relative to infection foci to exclude any input infected cells which did not lead to transmission. The monoclonal antibody and convalescent plasma we tested neutralized cell-free SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of B.1.351 virus, which was poorly neutralized with plasma from non-B.1.351 infections. In contrast, cell-to-cell spread of SARS-CoV-2 showed no sensitivity to monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma neutralization. These observations suggest that, once cells are infected, SARS-CoV-2 may be more difficult to neutralize in cell types and anatomical compartments permissive for cell-to-cell spread.

    quote !a = The monoclonal antibody and convalescent plasma we tested neutralized cell-free SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of B.1.351 virus, which was poorly neutralized with plasma from non-B.1.351 infections. In contrast, cell-to-cell spread of SARS-CoV-2 showed no sensitivity to monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma neutralization. These observations suggest that, once cells are infected, SARS-CoV-2 may be more difficult to neutralize in cell types and anatomical compartments permissive for cell-to-cell spread.

    / June, 2021 - bioRxiv
    quote !b = Given the rapid infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2, neutralization in natural infection very likely occurs after cells have been infected. If active infection is still present, neutralization may not be effective to the same degree in all infected cell types and anatomical compartments because of cell-to-cell spread of SARS-CoV-2.

    / June, 2021 - bioRxiv
    quote !c = Unlike natural infection, the antibodies elicited by a vaccine should be present before the exposure to the virus. A vaccine eliciting a strong neutralizing antibody response which lasts for months could potentially clear the cell-free infection before it infects cells or cells capable of cell-to-cell spread. If lower neutralization capacity is elicited by the vaccine, some cells could be infected, since any vaccine mediated T cell immunity would target infected cells, not the transmitted virus, and therefore some cellular infection would need to occur. Therefore, syncytia formation could potentially happen.

    quote !d = Both the earlier D614G variant and the B.1.351 variant showed similar insensitivity of cell-to-cell spread in D614G and B.1.351 elicited plasma, indicating that the insensitivity of cell-to-cell spread to neutralization is not specific to the infecting variant or the elicited neutralizing antibodies.

    quote !e = We have also verified previous observations about the drop in B.1.351 neutralization by non-B.1.351 elicited plasma in the H1299-ACE2 human lung cell system, as well as the cross-neutralization of D614G by B.1.351-elicited plasma. Interestingly, in these experiments, neutralization of B.1.351 by its matched plasma was weaker than neutralization of D614G by its matched plasma. Despite the overall weaker neutralization capacity, the B.1.351-elicited plasma could still effectively cross-neutralize, showing that cross-neutralization is not necessarily linked to absolute neutralization capacity.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257334
  ref 'Hillus_et_al_06_02_2021
    head = Unicenter study in a cohort of health care workers at a tertiary care center in Berlin, Germany. 340 health care workers immunised between 27 December 2020 and 21 May 2021 at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany

    > Objective
      To assess reactogenicity and immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost immunisations of ChAdOx1-nCoV19 (Vaxzevria, ChAdOx) followed by BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BNT) compared to homologous BNT/BNT immunisation.

    > Design
      Prospective, observational cohort study.

    > Setting
      Unicenter study in a cohort of health care workers at a tertiary care center in Berlin, Germany.

    > Participants
      340 health care workers immunised between 27 December 2020 and 21 May 2021 at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany

    > Main outcome measures
      The main outcomes were reactogenicity assessed on days one, three, five and seven post prime and boost vaccination, and immunogenicity measured by serum SARS-CoV-2 full spike-, spike S1-, and spike RBD-IgG, virus neutralisation capacity, anti-S1-IgG avidity, and T cell reactivity measured by Interferon gamma release assay at 3-4 weeks post prime and boost immunisation.

    > Results
      Heterologous ChAdOx/BNT booster vaccination was overall well-tolerated and reactogenicity was largely comparable to homologous BNT/BNT vaccination. Systemic reactions were most frequent after prime immunisation with ChAdOx (86%, 95CI: 79-91), and less frequent after homologous BNT/BNT (65%, 95CI: 56-72), or heterologous ChAdOx/BNT booster vaccination (48%, 95CI: 36-59). Serum antibody responses and T cell reactivity were strongly increased after both homologous and heterologous boost, and immunogenicity was overall robust, and comparable between both regimens in this cohort, with slightly increased S1-IgG avidity and T cell responses following heterologous booster immunisation.

    > Conclusions
      Evidence of rare thrombotic events associated with ChAdOx has led to recommendation of a heterologous booster with mRNA vaccines for certain age groups in several European countries, despite a lack of robust safety and immunogenicity data for this vaccine regimen. This interim analysis provides evidence that the currently recommended heterologous ChAdOx/BNT immunisation regimen with 10-12 week vaccine intervals is well tolerated and slightly more immunogenic compared to homologous BNT/BNT vaccination with three week vaccine intervals. Heterologous prime-boost immunisation for COVID-19 may be generally applicable to optimise logistics and improve immunogenicity and to mitigate potential intermittent supply shortages for individual vaccines.

    head = A retrospective single-center study examining  47 women’s IVF treatment parameters and pregnancies before and after their vaccination between February and May 2021.

    > Objective
      To investigate the possible impact of Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA BNT162b2 COVID19 vaccine on women’s fertility.

    > Methods
      A retrospective single-center study examining women’s IVF treatment parameters and pregnancies before and after their vaccination between February and May 2021. Each woman served as a self-control before and after vaccination. Additionally, in order to neutralize the effect of the sperm on fertilization, only Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) patients who were currently being treated with an ICSI cycle and had an earlier ICSI cycle available were included in the study. The study outcomes compared between the PRE and POST vaccination groups and consisted of: the IVF cycle outcomes, including the number of oocytes retrieved; the number of matured oocytes; the fertilization rate; and the number and quality of embryos at day 3. Clinical pregnancy was based on the first hCG value reported if the data were available for both cycles.

    > Results
      A final total of 47 women were eligible for inclusion with a mean interval of 362 ±368 days between the two ovum pick ups. The characteristics of their ICSI cycles before and after the vaccination were similar for all the parameters. Additionally, the number and percentage of clinical pregnancies did not significantly differ between the PRE and POST vaccination groups (n=15).

    > Conclusion
      This study is the first to evaluate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on women’s fertility. From our findings, the vaccine appears to have no impact on women’s fertility. This study is the first step in abolishing the misinformation derived from unreliable sources and reassuring patients in order to improve compliance and promote COVID-19 eradication.

    head = We trace viral, host, and social factors contributing to the scale and exponent of the fourth wave, when compared to preceding waves, in an epidemiological context.

    > Abstract
      In April 2021, after successfully enduring three waves of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic in 2020, and having reached population seropositivity of about 50%, Delhi, the national capital of India was overwhelmed by the fourth wave. Here, we trace viral, host, and social factors contributing to the scale and exponent of the fourth wave, when compared to preceding waves, in an epidemiological context.  shows an early phase of the upsurge driven by the entry of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC) into the region in January, with at least one B.1.1.7 super spreader event in February 2021, relatable to known mass gatherings over this period. This was followed by seeding of the B.1.617 VOC, which too is highly transmissible, with rapid expansion of B.1.617.2 sub-lineage outpacing all other lineages. This unprecedented growth of cases occurred in the background of high seropositivity, but with low median neutralizing antibody levels, in a serially sampled cohort. Vaccination breakthrough cases over this period were noted, disproportionately related to VOC in sequenced cases, but usually mild. We find that this surge of SARS-CoV2 infections in Delhi is best explained by the introduction of a new highly transmissible VOC, B.1.617.2, with likely immune-evasion properties; insufficient neutralizing immunity, despite high seropositivity; and social behavior that promoted transmission.

  ref 'Ku_et_al_06_03_2021
    head = We engineered an immunoglobulin M (IgM) neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) to overcome the resistance encountered by IgG-based therapeutics.

    > Abstract
      Resistance represents a major challenge for antibody-based therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–4. Here we engineered an immunoglobulin M (IgM) neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) to overcome the resistance encountered by IgG-based therapeutics. IgM-14 is >230-fold more potent than its parental IgG-14 in neutralizing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). IgM-14 potently neutralizes the resistant virus raised by its corresponding IgG-14, the newly emerged United Kingdom B.1.1.7, Brazilian P.1, and South African B.1.351 variants of concern (VOCs), and 21 other receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutants, many of which are resistant to the IgGs that have been authorized for emergency use. Although engineering IgG into IgM enhances antibody potency in general, selection of an optimal epitope is critical for identifying the most effective IgM that can overcome resistance. One single intranasal (IN) dose of 0.044 and 0.4 mg/kg IgM-14 confers prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in mice, respectively. IgM-14, but not IgG-14, also confers potent therapeutic protection against the P.1 and B.1.351 variants. IgM-14 exhibits desirable IN pharmacokinetics and safety in rodents. Our results demonstrate that IN administration of an engineered IgM can improve efficacy, reduce resistance, and simplify the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

  ref 'Singh_et_al_06_04_2021
    head = A Pan-India, Cross-sectional, Coronavirus Vaccine-induced Antibody Titre (COVAT) study was conducted that measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike binding antibody quantitatively, 21 days or more after the first and second dose of two vaccines in both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) naive and recovered HCW.

    > Background
      We assessed the humoral immune response after the completion of two doses of both ChAdOx1-nCOV (CovishieldTM) and BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) vaccines in Indian health care workers (HCW).

    > Methods
      A Pan-India, Cross-sectional, Coronavirus Vaccine-induced Antibody Titre (COVAT) study was conducted that measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike binding antibody quantitatively, 21 days or more after the first and second dose of two vaccines in both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) naive and recovered HCW. Primary aim was to analyze antibody response (seropositivity rate and median [inter-quartile range, IQR] antibody titre) following each dose of both vaccines and its correlation to age, sex, blood group, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. Here we report the final results of anti-spike antibody response after the two completed doses.

    > Results
      Among the 515 HCW (305 Male, 210 Female), 95.0% showed seropositivity after two doses of both vaccines. Of the 425 Covishield and 90 Covaxin recipients, 98.1% and 80.0% respectively, showed seropositivity. However, both seropositivity rate and median (IQR) rise in anti-spike antibody was significantly higher in Covishield vs. Covaxin recipient (98.1 vs. 80.0%; 127.0 vs. 53 AU/mL; both p<0.001). This difference persisted in 457 SARS-CoV-2 naive cohorts and propensity-matched (age, sex and BMI) analysis of 116 cohorts. While no difference was observed in relation to sex, BMI, blood group and any comorbidities; people with age >60 years or those with type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower seropositivity rates. Both vaccine recipients had similar solicited mild to moderate adverse events and none had severe or unsolicited side effects. In SARS-CoV-2 naive cohorts, sex, presence of comorbidities, and vaccine type were independent predictors of antibody positivity rate in multiple logistic regression analysis.

    > Conclusions
      Both vaccines elicited good immune response after two doses, although seropositivity rates and median anti-spike antibody titre was significantly higher in Covishield compared to Covaxin arm.

    head = We investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients treated with the two-antibody combination REGEN-COV, as well as in preclinical in vitro studies using single, dual, or triple antibody combinations, and in hamster in vivo studies using REGEN-COV or single monoclonal antibody treatments.

    > Summary
      Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a clinically validated therapeutic option against COVID-19. As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment-induced emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients treated with the two-antibody combination REGEN-COV, as well as in preclinical in vitro studies using single, dual, or triple antibody combinations, and in hamster in vivo studies using REGEN-COV or single monoclonal antibody treatments. Our study demonstrates that the combination of non-competing antibodies in REGEN-COV provides protection against all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest and also protects against emergence of new variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting.

  // The indirect effect of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccination on unvaccinated household members
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.21257896
  ref 'Salo_et_al_05_29_2021
    head = We used national databases that record all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mRNA-based (BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech or mRNA-1273 by Moderna) vaccine doses administered in Finland since the beginning of the epidemic.

    > Abstract
      This paper studies the direct and indirect effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines among vaccinated healthcare workers and their unvaccinated adult household members in a mass vaccine program in Finland.

    > Methods
      We used national databases that record all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mRNA-based (BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech or mRNA-1273 by Moderna) vaccine doses administered in Finland since the beginning of the epidemic. These data were merged with administrative full population datasets that include information on each person’s occupation and unique identifiers for spouses living in the same household. To estimate the direct and indirect effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccines in a household setting, we compared the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers as well as between their unvaccinated spouses.

    > Findings
      Our estimates imply indirect effectiveness of 8.7% (95% CI: -28.9 to 35.4) two weeks and 42.9% (95% CI: 22.3 to 58.1) 10 weeks after the first dose. The effectiveness estimates for unvaccinated household members are substantial, but smaller than the direct effect and occur more gradually among unvaccinated household members than among vaccinated individuals.

    > Interpretation
      Our results suggest that mRNA-based vaccines do not only prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections among vaccinated individuals but lead to a substantial reduction in infections among unvaccinated household members. The results are consistent with the notion that mRNA-based vaccines affect susceptibility in vaccinated individuals and prevent transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals.

  ref 'Roman_et_al_05_25_2021
    head = Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients.

    > Background
      We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients.

    > Methods
      Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted.

    > Results
      Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19 disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%).

    > Conclusions
      In comparison to standard of care [SOC] or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.

  // Prevalence of Clinical and Subclinical Myocarditis in Competitive Athletes With Recent SARS-CoV-2 Infection- Results From the Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.2065
  ref 'Daniels_et_al_05_27_2021
    head = Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry principal investigators were surveyed for aggregate observational data from March 1, 2020, through December 15, 2020, on athletes with COVID-19. Representing 13 universities, cardiovascular testing was performed in 1597 athletes (964 men [60.4%])

    > Importance
      Myocarditis is a leading cause of sudden death in competitive athletes. Myocardial inflammation is known to occur with SARS-CoV-2. Different screening approaches for detection of myocarditis have been reported. The Big Ten Conference requires comprehensive cardiac testing including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for all athletes with COVID-19, allowing comparison of screening approaches.

    > Objective
      To determine the prevalence of myocarditis in athletes with COVID-19 and compare screening strategies for safe return to play.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry principal investigators were surveyed for aggregate observational data from March 1, 2020, through December 15, 2020, on athletes with COVID-19. For athletes with myocarditis, presence of cardiac symptoms and details of cardiac testing were recorded. Myocarditis was categorized as clinical or subclinical based on the presence of cardiac symptoms and CMR findings. Subclinical myocarditis classified as probable or possible myocarditis based on other testing abnormalities. Myocarditis prevalence across universities was determined. The utility of different screening strategies was evaluated.

    > Exposures
      SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction testing.

    > Main Outcome and Measure
      Myocarditis via cardiovascular diagnostic testing.

    > Results
      Representing 13 universities, cardiovascular testing was performed in 1597 athletes (964 men [60.4%]). Thirty-seven (including 27 men) were diagnosed with COVID-19 myocarditis (overall 2.3%; range per program, 0%-7.6%); 9 had clinical myocarditis and 28 had subclinical myocarditis. If cardiac testing was based on cardiac symptoms alone, only 5 athletes would have been detected (detected prevalence, 0.31%). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for all athletes yielded a 7.4-fold increase in detection of myocarditis (clinical and subclinical). Follow-up CMR imaging performed in 27 (73.0%) demonstrated resolution of T2 elevation in all (100%) and late gadolinium enhancement in 11 (40.7%).

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive athletes with CMR screening after COVID-19 infection, 37 athletes (2.3%) were diagnosed with clinical and subclinical myocarditis. Variability was observed in prevalence across universities, and testing protocols were closely tied to the detection of myocarditis. Variable ascertainment and unknown implications of CMR findings underscore the need for standardized timing and interpretation of cardiac testing. These unique CMR imaging data provide a more complete understanding of the prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in college athletes after COVID-19 infection. The role of CMR in routine screening for athletes safe return to play should be explored further.

  ref 'Sen_et_al_02_2021
    head = We conducted a retrospective, interventional study on six consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis and were managed at two tertiary ophthalmic referral centers in India between August 1 and December 15, 2020.

    > Purpose
      COVID-19 infection, its treatment, resultant immunosuppression, and pre-existing comorbidities have made patients vulnerable to secondary infections including mucormycosis. It is important to understand the presentation, temporal sequence, risk factors, and outcomes to undertake measures for prevention and treatment.

    > Methods
      We conducted a retrospective, interventional study on six consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis and were managed at two tertiary ophthalmic referral centers in India between August 1 and December 15, 2020. Diagnosis of mucormycosis was based on clinical features, culture, and histopathology from sinus biopsy. Patients were treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B with addition of posaconazole and surgical debridement of necrotic tissue.

    > Results
      All patients were male, mean age 60.5 ± 12 (46.2–73.9) years, type 2 diabetics with mean blood glucose level of 222.5 ± 144.4 (86–404) mg/dL. Except for one patient who was diagnosed with mucormycosis concurrently with COVID-19, all patients received systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19. The mean duration between diagnosis of COVID-19 and development of symptoms of mucor was 15.6 ± 9.6 (3–42) days. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus debridement, whereas two patients required orbital exenteration. At the last follow-up, all six patients were alive, on antifungal therapy.

    > Conclusion
      Mucormycosis is a life-threatening, opportunistic infection, and patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 are more susceptible to it. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of invasive fungal infection with mucormycosis which can develop during the course of the illness or as a sequelae. High index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and appropriate management can improve survival.

      A middle-aged woman with diabetes presented with left-sided facial pain, complete ptosis and fever of short duration. On presentation, she had hyperglycaemia without ketosis. There was total ophthalmoplegia of the left eye with a visual acuity of 6/36. She incidentally tested positive for COVID-19. CT paranasal sinus and MRI brain revealed left-sided pansinusitis with acute infarct in the left parieto-occipital region without angioinvasion. An emergency functional endoscopic sinus procedure was done, which confirmed mucormycosis on histopathological examination. After 1 week of conventional amphotericin B and antibiotics, repeat CT brain showed improvement in mucosal thickening and sinusitis. This case is a rare presentation of mucormycosis associated with rapid progression to orbital apex syndrome with brain infarction in a patient with non-ketotic diabetes and COVID-19. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent further end-organ damage. It is also interesting that there was no angioinvasion and transient periarterial inflammation was attributed to brain infarction.

      Two doses of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines are highly effective against both symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Effectiveness is lower after only a single dose, particularly for older adults shortly after the first dose.

Individuals may be incubating at the time of vaccination, they may be exposed due to inadequate infection prevention and control measures at (or when travelling to/from) vaccination clinics, or they may assume protection immediately following vaccination and engage in higher risk behaviours before a sufficient immune response has developed. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures in vaccination clinics and examine the potential role of behavioural changes post first dose of COVID-19 vaccines.

  // Reduced sensitivity of infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617.2 to monoclonal antibodies and sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445838
  ref 'Planas_et_al_05_27_2021
    head = We isolated infectious B.1.617.2 from a traveller returning from India. We examined its sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in sera from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral lineages.

    > Abstract
      The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage emerged in October 2020 in India. It has since then become dominant in some indian regions and further spread to many countries. The lineage includes three main subtypes (B1.617.1, B.1617.2 and B.1.617.3), which harbour diverse Spike mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) which may increase their immune evasion potential. B.1.617.2 is believed to spread faster than the other versions. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.617.2 from a traveller returning from India. We examined its sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in sera from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral lineages. B.1.617.2 was resistant to neutralization by some anti-NTD and anti-RBD mAbs, including Bamlanivimab, which were impaired in binding to the B.1.617.2 Spike. Sera from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms and from Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine recipients were 3 to 6 fold less potent against B.1.617.2, relative to B.1.1.7. Sera from individuals having received one dose of AstraZeneca Vaxzevria barely inhibited B.1.617.2. Thus, B.1.617.2 spread is associated with an escape to antibodies targeting non-RBD and RBD Spike epitopes.

  // Single-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.21257797
  ref 'Gils_et_al_05_25_2021
    head = We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses following a single-dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine in 155 previously SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals participating in a population-based prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients. Participants varied widely in age, comorbidities, COVID-19 severity and time since infection, ranging from 1 to 15 months.

    > Background
      The urgent need for, but limited availability of, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines worldwide has led to widespread consideration of dose sparing strategies, particularly single vaccine dosing of individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    > Methods
      We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses following a single-dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine in 155 previously SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals participating in a population-based prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients. Participants varied widely in age, comorbidities, COVID-19 severity and time since infection, ranging from 1 to 15 months. Serum antibody titers were determined at time of vaccination and one week after vaccination. Responses were compared to those in SARS-CoV-2-naive health care workers after two BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine doses.

    > Results
      Within one week of vaccination, IgG antibody levels to virus spike and RBD proteins increased 27 to 29-fold and neutralizing antibody titers increased 12-fold, exceeding titers of fully vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.56 to 0.67 v. control 95% CrI: −0.16 to −0.02). Pre-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers had the largest positive mean effect size on titers following vaccination (95% CrI (0.16 to 0.45)). COVID-19 severity, the presence of comorbidities and the time interval between infection and vaccination had no discernible impact on vaccine response.

    > Conclusion
      A single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine up to 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection provides neutralizing titers exceeding two vaccine doses in previously uninfected individuals. These findings support wide implementation of a single-dose mRNA vaccine strategy after prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    quote !d = Overall, these results suggest that neutralization breadth was not improved after vaccination, most likely because neutralization after vaccination is overwhelmingly dominated by RBD responses, which are shown to be more sensitive to the mutations in the VOC. Nevertheless, a degree of cross-neutralization of these three VOCs was observed in all participants already after a single dose in previously infected individuals.

  ref 'Mattar_et_al_05_25_2021
    head = In this observational cohort study of female front-line workers with no history of COVID-19 infection, we amplified BNT162B2 mRNA in plasma and breast milk and assayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and anti-human syncytin-1 binding antibodies in plasma, at early (1-4 days) and late (4-7 weeks) time points following first-dose vaccination.

    > Objective
      To determine whether antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 mRNA vaccination cross-react with human syncytin-1 protein, and if BNT162B2 mRNA enters breast milk.

    > Methods
      In this observational cohort study of female front-line workers with no history of COVID-19 infection, we amplified BNT162B2 mRNA in plasma and breast milk and assayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and anti-human syncytin-1 binding antibodies in plasma, at early (1-4 days) and late (4-7 weeks) time points following first-dose vaccination.

    > Results
      Fifteen consented participants (mean age 40.4 years, various ethnicities) who received at least one dose of BNT162B2, including five breast-feeding women and two women who were inadvertently vaccinated in early pregnancy, were recruited. BNT162B2 mRNA, detected by amplifying part of the spike-encoding region, was detected in plasma 1-4 days following the first dose (n=13), but not 4-5 weeks later (n=2), nor was the mRNA isolated from aqueous or lipid breast milk fractions collected 0-7 days post-vaccination (n=5). Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong SARS-CoV-2 neutralising activity by at least four weeks after the first dose (n=15), including the two pregnant women. None had placental anti-syncytin-1 binding antibodies at either time-point following vaccination.

    > Conclusions
      BNT162B2-vaccinated women did not transmit vaccine mRNA to breast milk, and did not produce a concurrent humoral response to syncytin-1, suggesting that cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 on the developing trophoblast, or other adverse effects in the breast-fed infant from vaccine mRNA ingestion, are unlikely.

  // “Vaccine-Induced Covid-19 Mimicry” Syndrome: Splice reactions within the SARS-CoV-2 Spike open reading frame result in Spike protein variants that may cause thromboembolic events in patients immunized with vector-based vaccines
  doi: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-558954/v1
  ref 'Kowarz_et_al_05_26_2021
    head = We present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines.

    > Abstract
      During the last months many countries have started the immunization of millions of people by using vector-based vaccines. Unfortunately, severe side effects became overt during these vaccination campaigns: cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST), absolutely rare under normal life conditions, were found as a severe side effect that occured 4-14 days after first vaccinations. Besides CVST, Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis (SVT) was also observed. This type of adverse event has not been observed in the clinical studies of AstraZeneca, and therefore led immediately to a halt in vaccinations in several european countries. These events were mostly associated with thrombocytopenia, and thus, similar to the well-known Heparin-induced thrombo­cytopenia (HIT). Meanwhile, scientists have proposed a mechanism to explain this vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia. However, they do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the late thromboembolic events. Here, we present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines. According to our results, transcription of wildtype and codon-optimized Spike open reading frames enables alternative splice events that lead to C-terminal truncated, soluble Spike protein variants. These soluble Spike variants may initiate severe side effects when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels. In analogy to the thromboembolic events caused by Spike protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we termed the underlying disease mechanism the “Vaccine-Induced Covid-19 Mimicry” syndrome (VIC19M syndrome).

  ref 'Trogstad_et_al_2021
    head = Large, population-based cohort study- More than 80 000 cohort participants responding to electronic questionnaires about covid-19 vaccination and potential side effects during weeks 11-13, 2021. Response rate 58% (81267/138924), 83% were female, 85% health care workers and 80% were aged 40-55 years.


    > Objective
      To compare prevalence of skin, nose and gingival bleedings after receipt of adeno-vectored or mRNA-vaccines against covid-19. The hypothesis is that milder symptoms indicating altered thrombocyte function may affect a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals than the recently reported severe cases with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia.

    > Design

    > Setting
      Norway, nationwide.

    > Participants
      More than 80 000 cohort participants responding to electronic questionnaires about covid-19 vaccination and potential side effects during weeks 11-13, 2021. Response rate 58% (81267/138924), 83% were female, 85% health care workers and 80% were aged 40-55 years.

    > Main outcome measures
      Self-reported episodes of skin, nose and gingival bleedings. Variation in rates by registered vaccine type, age, sex, occupation, previous covid-19 infection and chronic disease.

    > Results
      Four of the 3416 subjects (0.2%) who were vaccinated with a single dose of mRNA vaccine reported skin bleeding as a side effect, as opposed to 163 of 5132 subjects (3.2%) vaccinated with a single dose of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine, OR (odds ratio)=16.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5-34.1). Corresponding ORs for nose and gingival bleeding were 8.0 (4.0-15.8) and 9.3 (4.3-20.0), respectively.

    > Conclusions
      These findings could potentially indicate that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine may lead to mild bleeding episodes in a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals, and not only in rare cases with documented thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Studies are needed to understand the possible mechanisms behind these observations, and to establish or refute whether they share similarities with the severe thromboembolic bleeding complications.

    head = We extend our previous phase 1/2 trial report and present BNT162b2 prime/boost induced immune response data from a second phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults (18-55 years of age).

    > Abstract
      BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Here we extend our previous phase 1/2 trial report and present BNT162b2 prime/boost induced immune response data from a second phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults (18-55 years of age). BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers up to 3.3-fold above those observed in COVID-19 human convalescent samples (HCS) one week post-boost. BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralized 22 pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Most participants had a strong IFNγ- or IL-2-positive CD8+ and CD4+ T helper type 1 (TH1) T cell response, detectable throughout the full observation period of nine weeks following the boost. pMHC multimer technology identified several BNT162b2-induced epitopes that were presented by frequent MHC alleles and conserved in mutant strains. One week post-boost, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells of the early differentiated effector-memory phenotype comprised 0.02-2.92% of total circulating CD8+ T cells and were detectable (0.01-0.28%) eight weeks later. In summary, BNT162b2 elicits an adaptive humoral and poly-specific cellular immune response against epitopes conserved in a broad range of variants at well tolerated doses.

Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, ≥7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed.

    > Results
      Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100).

    > Conclusions
      The BNT162b2 vaccine in 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against Covid-19. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; C4591001 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.

    > Abstract
      Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7–13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.

    head = A test negative case control design was used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status.

    > Background
      The B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant has contributed to the surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the  UK. We estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19  vaccines against this variant.

    > Methods
      A test negative case control design was used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases identified based on sequencing and S-gene  target status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status.

    > Results
      Effectiveness was notably lower after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3) compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from  93.4% (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with  B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2. Sequenced  cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had higher odds of infection with B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40; 95%CI: 1.13-1.75).

    > Conclusions
      After 2 doses of either vaccine there were only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2 variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with 2 doses among vulnerable groups.

Vaccine effects after two doses of ChAdOx1 vaccine were smaller than for BNT162b2 against either variant. This is consistent with reported clinical trial findings. However, rollout of second doses of ChAdOx1 was later than BNT162b2 and the difference may be explained by the limited follow-up after two doses of ChAdOx1 if it takes more than two weeks to reach maximum effectiveness with this vaccine. Consistent with this, 74% of those who had received 2 doses of ChAdOx1 had done so between 2 and 4 weeks prior to symptom onset compared to 46% with BNT162b2.

    head = The phase 3 portion of this adaptive, randomized, master protocol, included 4,057 Covid-19 outpatients with one or more risk factors for severe disease. Patients were randomized to a single treatment of intravenous placebo, or various doses of REGEN-COV, and followed for 28 days.

    > Background
      REGEN-COV antibody cocktail (casirivimab with imdevimab) rapidly reduced viral load and decreased medically-attended visits in the phase 1/2 portion of this trial; REGEN-COV, retains activity in vitro against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

    > Methods
      The phase 3 portion of this adaptive, randomized, master protocol, included 4,057 Covid-19 outpatients with one or more risk factors for severe disease. Patients were randomized to a single treatment of intravenous placebo, or various doses of REGEN-COV, and followed for 28 days. The prespecified hierarchical analysis first compared REGEN-COV 2400mg dose vs concurrent placebo, then compared the 1200mg dose vs concurrent placebo, for endpoints assessing risk of hospitalization or death, and time to symptom resolution. Safety was evaluated in all treated patients.

    > Results
      Both REGEN-COV 2400mg and 1200mg significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death compared to placebo (71.3% reduction [1.3% vs 4.6%; p<0.0001] and 70.4% reduction [1.0% vs 3.2%; p=0.0024], respectively). The median time to resolution of Covid-19 symptoms was 4 days shorter in both dose arms vs placebo (10 vs 14 days; p<0.0001). Efficacy of REGEN-COV was consistent across subgroups, including patients who were SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody-positive at baseline. REGEN-COV more rapidly reduced viral load than placebo. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (4.0%) than in the 1200mg (1.1%) and 2400mg (1.3%) groups and grade ≥2 infusion-related reactions were infrequent (<0.3% in all groups).

    > Conclusions
      Treatment with REGEN-COV was well-tolerated and significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death, rapidly resolved symptoms, and reduced viral load.

    head = We conducted a test-negative, case-control study of adults >=70 years of age from Sao Paulo State from January 17 to April 29, 2021, during which vaccination with a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac was implemented. We identified RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and controls who had a symptomatic illness with a negative RT-PCR test from national surveillance and state vaccination databases.

    > Background
      Mass vaccination is being used in response to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemics, including those driven by emerging variants of concern. We evaluated the effectiveness of the inactivated whole-virus vaccine, CoronaVac, against symptomatic COVID-19 in the elderly population of Sao Paulo State, Brazil during widespread circulation of the P.1 variant.

    > Methods
      We conducted a test-negative, case-control study of adults >=70 years of age from Sao Paulo State from January 17 to April 29, 2021, during which vaccination with a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac was implemented. We identified RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and controls who had a symptomatic illness with a negative RT-PCR test from national surveillance and state vaccination databases. Controls were pair-matched to cases by age category, sex, race, municipality, prior COVID-19 status, and date of RT-PCR testing. We estimated vaccine effectiveness, adjusted for age and comorbidities, using conditional logistic regression.

    > Findings
      We selected 7,950 matched pairs with a mean age of 76 years from 26,433 COVID-19 cases and 17,622 test-negative controls. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 18.2% (95% CI, 0.0 to 33.2) and 41.6% (95% CI, 26.9 to 53.3) in the period 0-13 and >=14 days, respectively, after the 2nd dose. Administration of a single vaccine dose was not associated with reduced odds of COVID-19. Vaccine effectiveness >=14 days after the 2nd dose declined with increasing age and was 61.8% (95% CI 34.8 to 77.7), 48.9% (95% CI 23.3 to 66.0) and 28.0% (95% CI 0.6 to 47.9) among individuals 70-74, 75-79 and >=80 years of age, respectively (p-interaction = 0.05).

    > Interpretation
      CoronaVac was 42% effective in the real-world setting of extensive P.1 transmission, but significant protection was not observed until completion of the two-dose regimen. These findings underscore the need to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions when mass vaccination with CoronaVac is used as part of an epidemic response

    > Abstract
      While significant insights have been gained around pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19, superspreading of coronaviruses remains a mystery. Cluster transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented in many contact tracing studies, where the majority of new SARS-CoV-2 infections are linked to a relatively small portion of infected individuals. Interestingly, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters like age, sex, and health conditions are not correlated with superspreading events. In this commentary, we will discuss what is known and unknown about coronavirus superspreader transmission and explore whether characteristics of the virion, the donor, or the environment contribute to this phenomenon.

    > Background
      Covid-19 vaccines are urgently needed, especially against emerging variants. NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 rS) nanoparticle vaccine containing trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant.

    > Methods
      A phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults 18-84 years old who received two intramuscular 5-µg doses, 21 days apart, of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (1:1) across 33 sites in the United Kingdom. The primary efficacy endpoint was virologically confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 with onset 7 days after second vaccination in serologically negative participants.

    > Results
      A total of 15,187 participants were randomized, of whom 7569 received NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received placebo; 27.2% were 65 years or older, 44.7% had comorbidities and 4.2% had baseline serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2. There were 10 cases of Covid-19 among NVX-CoV2373 recipients and 96 cases among placebo recipients, with symptom onset at least 7 days after second vaccination; NVX-CoV2373 was 89.7% (95% confidence interval, 80.2 to 94.6) effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported. There were five cases of severe Covid-19, all in the placebo group. Post hoc analysis revealed efficacies of 96.4% (73.8 to 99.5) and 86.3% (71.3 to 93.5) against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant, respectively. Vaccine efficacy was similar across subgroups, including participants with comorbidities and those ≥65 years old. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups.

    > Conclusion
      A two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 conferred 89.7% protection against a blend of prototype and variant Covid-19, demonstrated high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant, and had a reassuring safety profile.

  ref 'Cheng_et_al_05_20_2021
    head = We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number.

    > Abstract
      Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing.

  // Efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.351 Variant
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2103055
  ref 'Shinde_et_al_05_20_2021
    head = In this phase 2a–b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 μg of recombinant spike protein with 50 μg of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo.

    > Background
      The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. In a phase 1–2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

    > Methods
      In this phase 2a–b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 μg of recombinant spike protein with 50 μg of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    > Results
      Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, −0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

    > Conclusions
      The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.

  // Reinfection by the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant in blood donors in Manaus, Brazil

  ref 'Prete_et_al_05_12_2021
    head = In order to estimate the reinfection rate during the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, we tested serial samples from 238 unvaccinated repeat blood donors using a SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG chemiluminescence microparticle assay.

    > Abstract
      The city of Manaus, north Brazil, was stricken by a severe epidemic of SARS-Cov-2 in March 2020, reaching a seroprevalence of 76% by October 2020. Nevertheless, in late November an abrupt increase in hospitalizations and deaths hit Manaus, causing higher number of deaths compared to the first epidemic wave. It has been hypothesized that virus lineages circulating in the second wave, namely the P.1 variant of concern first detected in early December in Manaus, could be better at evading immunity generated in response to previous infection with other lineages.

      In order to estimate the reinfection rate during the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, we tested serial samples from 238 unvaccinated repeat blood donors using a SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG chemiluminescence microparticle assay. Blood donors were divided into six groups that reflected the inferred sequence of infection and reinfection with non-P.1 and P.1 variants. We assumed that reinfections induce a recrudescence (or “boosting”) of plasma anti-N IgG antibody levels, yielding a V-shaped time series of antibody reactivity levels.

      We infer that 16.9% (95% CI [9.48%, 28.5%]) of all presumed P.1 infections that were observed in 2021 were reinfections. If we also include cases of probable or possible reinfections (defined by considering the time period when the antibody levels are expected to grow after recovery and the range of half-lives for antibody waning after seroconversion), these percentages increase respectively to 25.8% (95% CI [16.7%, 37.4%]), and 31.0% (95% CI [21.4%, 42.5%]). Our data suggest that reinfection due to P.1 is common and more frequent than what has been detected by traditional epidemiologic, molecular and genomic surveillance of clinical cases.

  // Long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals are robustly boosted by immunization with the CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccines

    head =  We show that outpatient and hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals mount a robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) response that peaks at days 23 and 27 post-symptom onset, respectively.

    > Abstract
      The durability of circulating neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their boosting by vaccination remains to be defined. We show that outpatient and hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals mount a robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) response that peaks at days 23 and 27 post-symptom onset, respectively. Although nAb titers remained higher in hospitalized patients, both study groups showed long-lasting nAb responses that can persist for up to 12 months after natural infection. These nAb responses in previously seropositive individuals can be significantly boosted through immunization with two doses of the CoronaVac (Sinovac) or one dose of the BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccines, suggesting a substantial induction of B cell memory responses. Noteworthy, three obese previously seropositive individuals failed to mount a booster response upon vaccination, warranting further studies in this population. Immunization of naive individuals with two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine or one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine elicited similar levels of nAbs compared to seropositive individuals 4,2 to 13.3 months post-infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this preliminary evidence suggests that both, seropositive and naive individuals, require two doses of CoronaVac to ensure the induction of robust nAb titers.

A study of immunogenicity showed 16 titres of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after the first dose and 64 titres after the second dose, which correlates with the published results from vaccine clinical trial phase 1/2 and phase 3 in Russia. Unfortunately, due to the use of different ELISA kits, it is not possible to compare the specific IgG concentrations in these studies. However, it should be noted that a specific humoral response was detected in all vaccinated participants. An important detail in the report from Argentina is the observation that vaccination of people with a history of COVID-19 leads to a quick and significant increase in antibodies after a single dose of vaccine.

      Population based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who received standard or extended interval double vaccination.

    > Setting
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021. Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.

  // The Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 and B.1.618 Variants Identified in India Provide Partial Resistance to Vaccine-elicited and Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.444076

    head = We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.

    > Abstract
      Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants recently identified in India designated B.1.617 and B.1.618 have mutations within the spike protein that may contribute to their increased transmissibility and that could potentially result in re-infection or resistance to vaccine elicited antibody. B.1.617 encodes a spike protein with mutations L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R while the B.1.618 spike has mutations D145-146, E484K and D614G. We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Viruses with B.1.617 and B.1.618 spike were neutralized with a 2-5-fold decrease in titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies. The E484Q and E484K versions were neutralized with a 2-4-fold decrease in titer. Virus with the B.1.617 spike protein was neutralized with a 4.7-fold decrease in titer by the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail as a result of the L452R mutation. The modest neutralization resistance of the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618 variants.

    head = We present a comprehensive assessment of the impact of variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and B.1.526 on binding, neutralizing, and ACE2-blocking antibodies elicited by the vaccine mRNA-1273 over seven months.


    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 mutations may diminish vaccine-induced protective immune responses, and the durability of such responses has not been previously reported. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of the impact of variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and B.1.526 on binding, neutralizing, and ACE2-blocking antibodies elicited by the vaccine mRNA-1273 over seven months. Cross-reactive neutralizing responses were rare after a single dose of mRNA-1273. At the peak of response to the second dose, all subjects had robust responses to all variants. Binding and functional antibodies against variants persisted in most subjects, albeit at low levels, for 6 months after the primary series of mRNA-1273. Across all assays, B.1.351 had the greatest impact on antibody recognition, and B.1.1.7 the least. These data complement ongoing studies of clinical protection to inform the potential need for additional boost vaccinations.

  // Does mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine influence patients' performance during IVF-ET cycle?
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12958-021-00757-6
  ref 'Orvieto_et_al_05_13_2021
    head = The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to vaccination.

    > Objective
      No information exists in the literature regarding the effect of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on subsequent IVF cycle attempt. We therefore aim to assess the influence of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on IVF treatments.

    > Design
      An observational study.

    > Setting
      A tertiary, university-affiliated medical center.

    > Patients and Methods
      All couples undergoing consecutive ovarian stimulation cycles for IVF before and after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage. The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to vaccination.

    > Main outcome measures
      Stimulation characteristics and embryological variables.

    > Results
      Thirty-six couples resumed IVF treatment 7–85 days after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. No in-between cycles differences were observed in ovarian stimulation and embryological variables before and after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

    > Conclusions
      mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not affect patients’ performance or ovarian reserve in their immediate subsequent IVF cycle. Future larger studies with longer follow-up will be needed to validate our observations.

    quote !a = We have a serious concern regarding the availability of the data from which the investigators draw their conclusions. The investigators state that data will not be shared before the trial is completed, and then only by approval of stakeholders, including a so-called security department. Data sharing is one of the cornerstones of research integrity; it should not be conditional and should follow the FAIR principles.

    quote !b = The second concern pertains to the trial protocol, as already described in an open letter by the Russian Society for Evidence-Based Medicine.3 The Sputnik V investigators mention that three interim analyses were added to the study on Nov 5, 2020,1 but this change was not recorded on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). Unfortunately, the full study protocol has not been made publicly available, so the rationale behind this change or the type I error rate adjustment, if any, is not known.

    quote !c = Besides these protocol amendments, the definition of the primary outcome is unclear in the Article,1 where it says that when COVID-19 was suspected, participants were assessed with “COVID-19 diagnostic protocols, including PCR testing”. Here, we lack some crucial information, such as the clinical parameters determining suspected COVID-19, what diagnostic protocols were used, when the PCR testing was done, what specific method was used, or how many amplification cycles were used. The way cases of suspected COVID-19 were defined could have led to bias in PCR testing used to assess the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which is crucial for the efficacy determination.

    / May, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !d = A final point of concern about the study protocol relates to the enrolment and randomisation of patients. According to the trial profile in figure 1 of the Article,1 35 963 individuals were screened and 21 977 individuals were randomised. The ClinicalTrials.gov record for NCT04530396 (Jan 20, 2021) mentions that 33 758 patients were enrolled. We would expect that this last figure should be equal to either the number of participants screened or randomised. Moreover, there is no information about what caused the exclusion of 13 986 participants, as per the trial profile.

    / May, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !e = The third concern relates to the data reported and numerical results. We found the following data inconsistencies: (1) in figure 2 of the Article,1 data for the vaccinated group on day 20 refer to more individuals than at day 10, as if there was either information missing for 100 participants at day 10, or participants were enrolled after day 10 (figure 2 was formally corrected on Feb 20, 2021, but the correction statement did not state the reasons leading to such correction); and (2) in table S1 of the appendix,1 the number of participants reported for the different vaccinated age cohorts do not add up to the reported total (n=338 vs n=342). With such inconsistencies, we question the accuracy of the reported data.

    / May, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !f = A very peculiar result of the major subgroup analysis of the primary outcome caught our attention. The vaccine efficacy was said to be high for all age groups. The reported percentages were 91·9% in the 18–30-year age group, 90·0% in the31–40-year age group, 91·3% in the 41–50-year age group, 92·7% in the 51–60-year age group, and 91·8% in participants older than 60 years. We checked the homogeneity of vaccine efficacy across age groups (interaction tests): the p value of the Tarone-adjusted Breslow-Day test was 0·9963, and the p value of a non-asymptotic test was 0·9956, indicating a very low probability of observing a homogeneity this good if the actual homogeneity is perfect. By applying 18 other homogeneity tests (six in table 1, seven in table S6, six in table 2 of the Article1), we could not find other major abnormality in the overall distribution of p values.

    / May, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !g = We also found some highly coincidental results reported in table S3 of the appendix. In particular, two upper confidence limit values for two different distributions (placebo group at baseline for unstimulated and antigen-stimulated measures) both equal 0·708. Of course, this is possible, but we call once more for access to the data from which the statistics originate for close scrutiny.

    > Background
      Recent reports demonstrate robust serological responses to a single dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Data on immune responses following a single-dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection are however limited, and current guidelines recommend a two-dose regime regardless of preexisting immunity.

    > Methods
      We compared spike-specific IgG and pseudo-neutralizing spike-ACE2 blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 following two doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and a single dose of the adenovector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 232 healthcare workers with and without previous COVID-19.

    > Findings
      The post-vaccine levels of spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild type and all three variants of concern were similar or higher in participants receiving a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both < 11 months post infection (n=37) and ≥ 11 months infection (n=46)) compared to participants who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=149).

  ref 'Taquet_et_al_05_11_2021
    head = Using an electronic health records network primarily based in the USA, we estimated the incidence of CVT occurring in confirmed COVID-19 cases (both hospitalised and nonhospitalised) and compared this incidence to two other groups: people who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, and a cohort of patients with influenza. We could not make a direct comparison with rates after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (“Oxford-AstraZeneca”) vaccine because this has not been used in the USA. We also examined the rate of portal vein thrombosis (PVT), another diagnosis associated with thrombosis in the venous system and thought to occur in VITT.

    > Objectives
      To estimate the absolute risk of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in the two weeks following a diagnosis of COVID-19, and to assess the relative risks (RR) compared to influenza or the administration of an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19.

    > Design
      Retrospective cohort study based on an electronic health records network

    > Setting
      Linked records between primary and secondary care centres within 59 healthcare organisations, primarily in the USA

    > Participants
      All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between January 20, 2020 and March 25, 2021 were included (N=537,913, mean [SD] age: 46.2 [21.4] years; 54.9% females). Cohorts (matched for age, sex, and race) of participants diagnosed with influenza (N=392,424) or receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine (N=366,869) were used for comparison.

    > Main outcome measures
      Diagnosis of CVT (ICD-10 code I67.6) or PVT (ICD-10 code I81) within 2 weeks after a diagnosis of COVID-19.

    > Results
      The incidence of CVT after COVID-19 diagnosis was 42.8 per million people (95% CI 28.5–64.2) including 35.3 per million (95% CI 22.6–55.2) first diagnoses. This was significantly higher than the CVT incidence in a matched cohort of patients with influenza (RR=3.83, 95% CI 1.56–9.41, P<0.001) and people who received an mRNA vaccine (RR=6.67, 95% CI 1.98–22.43, P<0.001). The incidence of PVT after COVID-19 diagnosis was 392.3 per million people (95% CI 342.8–448.9) including 175.0 per million (95% CI 143.0–214.1) first diagnoses. This was significantly higher than the PVT incidence in a matched cohort of patients with influenza (RR=1.39, 95% CI 1.06–1.83, P=0.02) and people who received an mRNA vaccine (RR=7.40, 95% CI 4.87–11.24, P<0.001). Mortality after CVT and PVT was 17.4% and 19.9% respectively.

    > Conclusions
      The incidence of CVT and PVT is significantly increased after COVID-19. The data highlight the risk of serious thrombotic events in COVID-19 and can help contextualize the risks and benefits of vaccination in this regard

  ref 'Chan_et_al_05_08_2021
    head = We examined case reports, press releases and immunization data and calculated pooled estimates of VITT incidence using random effects models.

    > Context
      Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has been reported after administering ChAdOx1-S recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (marketed as Vaxzevira™ by Astra-Zeneca, Covishield™). Estimates of incidence vary between countries, due to different age distributions chosen, case definitions and choice of denominator (persons vaccinated vs immunizations given). This study clarifies these estimates by pooling data from ten countries and examining differences by age group.

    > Methods
      We examined case reports, press releases and immunization data and calculated pooled estimates of VITT incidence using random effects models. Sensitivity analyses considered different combinations of countries and varying assumptions on time between vaccination and reporting of cases.

    > Results
      Pooling all countries, VITT incidence was 0.73 per 100,000 persons receiving first dose of Covishield/Vaxzevira [95% CI .43,1.23]. Incidence for age 65 and over was 0.11 per 100,000 persons [95% CI .05-.26], and significantly higher among those under age 55: 1.67 per 100,000 persons [95% CI 1.30-2.14] in the UK, 5.06 per 100,000 persons in Norway [95% CI 2.16, 11.86]. The latter had the best data on counts of persons vaccinated. Incidence for age 55 to 64 years was 0.34 [95% CI 0.13, 0.85] in the UK, lower than for under age 55.

    > Conclusion
      VITT is a rare vaccine-associated adverse event. Incidence estimates vary between jurisdictions. However, even the highest reported incidence from Norway is low – and in settings with high community transmission, lower than risk of serious outcomes associated with Covid-19. Policymakers and individuals can use these data to calculate risk-benefit ratios and better target vaccine distribution.

    head = The neutralizing-antibody (NAb) titer against B.1.167.1 and prototype B.1 variant (D614G) was determined of the vaccine sera (4 weeks after second dose) of COVID-19 naïve subjects (n=43) and COVID-19 recovered subjects (n=18).

    > Abstract
      Covishield comprises the larger proportion in the vaccination program in India. Hence, it is of utmost importance to understand neutralizing capability of vaccine against the B.1.617.1 variant which is considered to responsible for surge of the cases in India. The neutralizing-antibody (NAb) titer against B.1.167.1 and prototype B.1 variant (D614G) was determined of the vaccine sera (4 weeks after second dose) of COVID-19 naïve subjects (n=43) and COVID-19 recovered subjects (n=18). The results demonstrated that sera of COVID-19 recovered subjects (n=18) who received two doses of Covishield have higher NAb response compared to the COVID-19 naive with a significant difference (p<0.0001) in NAb titer against B.1 and B.1.617.1 In-spite of reduction in the neutralizing titer against B.1.617.1 variant; Covishield vaccine-induced antibodies are likely to be protective to limit the severity and mortality of the disease in the vaccinated individuals.

    > Abstract
      In light of the massive and rapid vaccination campaign against COVID-19, continuous real-world effectiveness and safety assessment of the FDA-authorized vaccines is critical to amplify transparency, build public trust, and ultimately improve overall health outcomes. In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent authorization of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, there are not yet enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform. Collectively, this study provides further evidence that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reaffirms the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally.

  // Estimating the early impact of immunization against COVID-19 on deaths among elderly people in Brazil: analyses of secondary data on vaccine coverage and mortality
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.21256187
  ref 'Victora_et_al_04_30_2021
    head = Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021.

    > Background
      Immunization against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of immunizations on the mortality of individuals aged 80+ years.

    > Methods
      By April 22, 2021, 147,454 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021.

    > Findings
      As the P.1 variant spread throughout Brazil, the total number of deaths increased over time starting in epidemiological week 9 of 2021. The proportion of all deaths occurring at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 13.1% in weeks 13-14. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-79 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 6.9 times in weeks 13-14. Coronavac accounted for 77.3% and AstraZeneca for 15.9% of all doses administered. Vaccination coverage (first dose) increased rapidly among individuals aged 80+ years, reaching 49.1% in weeks 5-6 and over 90% after week 9.

    > Interpretation
      Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with an important decline in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the P.1 variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 13,824 deaths would have been expected up to week 14.

      Several European countries have suspended the inoculation of the AstraZeneca vaccine out of suspicion that it causes deep vein thrombosis. In this letter, we report some Fermi estimates performed using a stochastic model aimed at making a risk–benefit analysis of the interruption of the delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine in France and Italy.

    > Background
      The Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccines have shown excellent safety and efficacy in phase 3 trials. We aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines in a UK community setting.

    > Methods
      In this prospective observational study, we examined the proportion and probability of self-reported systemic and local side-effects within 8 days of vaccination in individuals using the COVID Symptom Study app who received one or two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine or one dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We also compared infection rates in a subset of vaccinated individuals subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR or lateral flow tests with infection rates in unvaccinated controls. All analyses were adjusted by age (≤55 years vs >55 years), sex, health-care worker status (binary variable), obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2 vs ≥30 kg/m2), and comorbidities (binary variable, with or without comorbidities).

    > Findings
      Between Dec 8, and March 10, 2021, 627 383 individuals reported being vaccinated with 655 590 doses: 282 103 received one dose of BNT162b2, of whom 28 207 received a second dose, and 345 280 received one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Systemic side-effects were reported by 13·5% (38 155 of 282 103) of individuals after the first dose of BNT162b2, by 22·0% (6216 of 28 207) after the second dose of BNT162b2, and by 33·7% (116 473 of 345 280) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Local side-effects were reported by 71·9% (150 023 of 208 767) of individuals after the first dose of BNT162b2, by 68·5% (9025 of 13 179) after the second dose of BNT162b2, and by 58·7% (104 282 of 177 655) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Systemic side-effects were more common (1·6 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 2·9 times after the first dose of BNT162b2) among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than among those without known past infection. Local effects were similarly higher in individuals previously infected than in those without known past infection (1·4 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 1·2 times after the first dose of BNT162b2). 3106 of 103 622 vaccinated individuals and 50 340 of 464 356 unvaccinated controls tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant reductions in infection risk were seen starting at 12 days after the first dose, reaching 60% (95% CI 49–68) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 69% (66–72) for BNT162b2 at 21–44 days and 72% (63–79) for BNT162b2 after 45–59 days.

    > Interpretation
      Systemic and local side-effects after BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination occur at frequencies lower than reported in phase 3 trials. Both vaccines decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 days.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716
  ref 'Wu_et_al_05_06_2021
    head = This is a preliminary evaluation of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 given as boosters to individuals that had been vaccinated 6.2 to 6.7 months previously with mRNA-1273 in an amended phase 2 clinical trial of mRNA-1273.The modified vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351.


    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has led to more than 3 million deaths worldwide. Safe and effective vaccines are now available, including the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine, which encodes for the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation by 2 proline substitutions. This vaccine showed 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some of which have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. In addition, recent evidence of waning antibody levels after infection or vaccination point to the need for periodic boosting of immunity. Here we present the preliminary evaluation of a clinical study on the use of the prototype mRNA-1273 or modified COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as booster vaccines in participants previously vaccinated approximately 6 months earlier with two doses of the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273. The modified vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. As single 50 µg booster vaccinations, both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 had acceptable safety profiles and were immunogenic. Antibody neutralization titers against B.1.351 and P.1 variants measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays before the booster vaccinations, approximately 6 to 8 months after the primary series, were low or below the assay limit of quantification, although geometric mean titers versus the wild-type strain remained above levels likely to be protective. Two weeks after the booster vaccinations, titers against the wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels similar to or higher than peak titers after the primary series vaccinations. Although both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 boosted neutralization of the wild-type original strain, and B.1.351 and P.1 variants, mRNA-1273.351 appeared to be more effective at increasing neutralization of the B.1.351 virus versus a boost with mRNA-1273. The vaccine trial is ongoing and boosting of clinical trial participants with the multivalent mRNA-1273.211 is currently being evaluated.

Importantly, in this small study, the booster dose of mRNA-1273.351 appears to be tolerated (solicited local and systemic adverse events) at least as well if not better than a booster dose of mRNA-1273.

The vaccine designs evaluated in this clinical study demonstrate the ability to boost immunity to titers that likely exceed those that peak after the primary vaccination series against both the wild-type virus and variants, and also demonstrate the potential of the mRNA-1273.351 booster to close the gap between neutralization of the wild-type virus and the B.1.351 variant. In the future, additional VOC designs can be rapidly developed, evaluated, and deployed if needed to address the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus.

  // An observational study to identify the prevalence of thrombocytopenia and anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies in Norwegian health care workers after COVID‐19 vaccination
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15352
  ref 'Sørvoll_et_al_04_28_2021
    head = 492 health care workers recently vaccinated with the first dose of AZD1222 were recruited from two hospitals in Norway. Study individuals were screened for thrombocytopenia and the presence of anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies with a PF4/PVS IgG ELISA immunoassay.

    > Background
      The COVID‐19 Vaccine from AstraZeneca (AZD1222) is one of several vaccines introduced to provide immunity against SARS‐CoV‐2. Recently, more than 50 cases have been reported presenting a combination of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and remarkably high levels of anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies post‐AZD1222 vaccination. Now linked to the vaccine, the condition is referred to as vaccine‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The European Medicines Agency still recommends vaccination with AZD1222, but several European countries have temporally paused and/or restricted its use because of the perceived risk of this severe side effect. As there is no description of PF4/polyanion antibody testing in the clinical trials, knowledge about the prevalence of such antibodies in a vaccinated cohort is needed.

    > Objectives
      To investigate prevalence of thrombocytopenia and anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies in a population recently vaccinated with AZD1222.

    > Patients/Methods
      492 health care workers recently vaccinated with the first dose of AZD1222 were recruited from two hospitals in Norway. Study individuals were screened for thrombocytopenia and the presence of anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies with a PF4/PVS IgG ELISA immunoassay. Side effects after vaccination were registered.

    > Results
      The majority of study participants had normal platelet counts and negative immunoassay. Anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies without platelet activating properties were only detected in 6 individuals (OD ≥ 0.4, range 0.58‐1.16), all with normal platelet counts. No subjects had severe thrombocytopenia.

    > Conclusions
      We found low prevalence of both thrombocytopenia and antibodies to PF4/polyanion‐complexes among Norwegian health care workers after vaccination with AZD1222.

  // Infection and vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.1 variant.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.09.443299
  ref 'Edara_et_al_07_30_2021
    head = We used a Live virus Focus Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT) to compare the neutralizing antibody response in serum from 24 convalescent COVID-19 individuals (31-91 days after symptom onset), 15 mRNA-1273 vaccinated individuals (35-51 days post-2nd dose), and 10 BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals (7-27 days post-2nd dose).

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 has caused a devastating global pandemic. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are less sensitive to neutralization by convalescent sera or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. A second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in India is leading to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The B.1.617.1 variant has rapidly spread throughout India and to several countries throughout the world. In this study, using a live virus assay, we describe the neutralizing antibody response to the B.1.617.1 variant in serum from infected and vaccinated individuals. We found that the B.1.617.1 variant is 6.8-fold more resistant to neutralization by sera from COVID-19 convalescent and Moderna and Pfizer vaccinated individuals. Despite this, a majority of the sera from convalescent individuals and all sera from vaccinated individuals were still able to neutralize the B.1.617.1 variant. This suggests that protective immunity by the mRNA vaccines tested here are likely retained against the B.1.617.1 variant. As the B.1.617.1 variant continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor how additional mutations within the spike impact antibody resistance, viral transmission and vaccine efficacy.

  ref 'Braga_et_al_04_07_2021
    head = We show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation.

    > Abstract
      COVID-19 is a disease with unique characteristics that include lung thrombosis1, frequent diarrhoea2, abnormal activation of the inflammatory response and rapid deterioration of lung function consistent with alveolar oedema4. The pathological substrate for these findings remains unknown. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. The generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. On the basis of these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with more than 3,000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductance in spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F (also known as anoctamin 6), a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase that is responsible for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of niclosamide for therapy.

  // Loss of furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

  ref 'Johnson_et_al_01_25_2021
    head = To explore whether the furin cleavage site contributes to infection and pathogenesis in this virus, we generated a mutant SARS-CoV-2 that lacks the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA).

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—a new coronavirus that has led to a worldwide pandemic—has a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein that is absent in other group-2B coronaviruses. To explore whether the furin cleavage site contributes to infection and pathogenesis in this virus, we generated a mutant SARS-CoV-2 that lacks the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA). Here we report that replicates of ΔPRRA SARS-CoV-2 had faster kinetics, improved fitness in Vero E6 cells and reduced spike protein processing, as compared to parental SARS-CoV-2. However, the ΔPRRA mutant had reduced replication in a human respiratory cell line and was attenuated in both hamster and K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Despite reduced disease, the ΔPRRA mutant conferred protection against rechallenge with the parental SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the neutralization values of sera from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 were lower against the ΔPRRA mutant than against parental SARS-CoV-2, probably owing to an increased ratio of particles to plaque-forming units in infections with the former. Together, our results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site in infection with SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the importance of this site for evaluating the neutralization activities of antibodies.

  // SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 emergence and sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.443253
  ref 'Ferreira_et_al_05_09_2021
    head = We delineate the phylogenetics of B.1.617 and spike mutation frequencies, in the context of others bearing L452R.

    > Abstract
      The B.1.617 variant emerged in the Indian state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India and to at least 40 countries. There have been fears that two key mutations seen in the receptor binding domain L452R and E484Q would have additive effects on evasion of neutralising antibodies. Here we delineate the phylogenetics of B.1.617 and spike mutation frequencies, in the context of others bearing L452R. The defining mutations in B.1.617.1 spike are L452R and E484Q in the RBD that interacts with ACE2 and is the target of neutralising antibodies. All B.1.617 viruses have the P681R mutation in the polybasic cleavage site region in spike. We report that B.1.617.1 spike bearing L452R, E484Q and P681R mediates entry into cells with slightly reduced efficiency compared to Wuhan-1. This spike confers modestly reduced sensitivity to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies that is similar in magnitude to the loss of sensitivity conferred by L452R or E484Q alone. Furthermore we show that the P681R mutation significantly augments syncytium formation upon the B.1.617.1 spike protein, potentially contributing to increased pathogenesis observed in hamsters and infection growth rates observed in humans.

  // Vaccination boosts naturally enhanced neutralizing breadth to SARS-CoV-2 one year after infection
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443175
  ref 'Wang_et_al_05_09_2021
    head = We report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines.

    > Abstract
      Over one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several excellent vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies. Here we report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines. In the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response, and as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern that are comparable to or greater than neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 achieved by vaccination of naive individuals. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover, and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in variants of concern. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand dramatically after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Should memory responses evolve in a similar manner in vaccinated individuals, additional appropriately timed boosting with available vaccines could cover most circulating variants of concern.

  // Platelet Activation by Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) Patient Serum is Blocked by COX, P2Y12 and Kinase Inhibitors
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.24.21255655
  ref 'Smith_et_al_04_27_2021
    head = Aggregation responses of healthy donor washed platelets were assessed in response to serum from patients with VITT pre- and post-intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and in the presence of anti-FcγRIIA blocking IV.3 F(ab), anti-platelet drugs and kinase inhibitors.

    > Background
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Vaccines are an important part of the response. Although rare, unusual thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia in recipients 4–16 days after vaccination with the AstraZeneca AZD1222 have been reported. This syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) clinically resembles heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is caused by platelet activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). Here, we investigate the effect of serum from patients with VITT on platelet activation, and assess the ability of clinically available therapeutics to prevent platelet activation.

    > Methods
      Aggregation responses of healthy donor washed platelets were assessed in response to serum from patients with VITT pre- and post-intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and in the presence of anti-FcγRIIA blocking IV.3 F(ab), anti-platelet drugs and kinase inhibitors.

    > Findings
      Four patients (21 - 48 years old) presented with thrombosis (three patients: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, one patient: ischemic stroke) and thrombocytopenia 10-14 days after AZD1222 vaccination. All patients tested positive for anti-PF4 antibody despite no prior heparin exposure. Serum from patients with VITT, but not healthy donor controls, induced platelet aggregation, which was abrogated following IVIg treatment. Aggregation to patient sera was blocked by IV.3 F(ab) which targets FcγRIIA, and inhibitors of Src, Syk and Btk kinases downstream of the receptor. Anti-platelet therapies indomethacin and ticagrelor also blocked aggregation.

    > Interpretation
      In conclusion, serum from patients with VITT activates platelets via the FcγRIIA, which can be blocked in vitro by anti-platelet therapies suggesting possible new therapeutic interventions for this rare syndrome.

      Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia, a rare and serious condition, has been described in Europe following receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca), which uses a chimpanzee adenoviral vector. A mechanism similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been proposed. In the US, the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), which uses a human adenoviral vector, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 27, 2021. By April 12, 2021, approximately 7 million Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses had been given in the US, and 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia had been identified among the recipients, resulting in a temporary national pause in vaccination with this product on April 13, 2021.

    > Objective
      To describe reports of CVST with thrombocytopenia following Ad26.COV2.S vaccine receipt.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      Case series of 12 US patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia following use of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under EUA reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 2 to April 21, 2021 (with follow-up reported through April 21, 2021).

    > Exposures
      Receipt of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Clinical course, imaging, laboratory tests, and outcomes after CVST diagnosis obtained from VAERS reports, medical record review, and discussion with clinicians.

    > Results
      Patients’ ages ranged from 18 to younger than 60 years; all were White women, reported from 11 states. Seven patients had at least 1 CVST risk factor, including obesity (n = 6), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and oral contraceptive use (n = 1); none had documented prior heparin exposure. Time from Ad26.COV2.S vaccination to symptom onset ranged from 6 to 15 days. Eleven patients initially presented with headache; 1 patient initially presented with back pain and later developed headache. Of the 12 patients with CVST, 7 also had intracerebral hemorrhage; 8 had non-CVST thromboses. After diagnosis of CVST, 6 patients initially received heparin treatment. Platelet nadir ranged from 9 ×103/µL to 127 ×103/µL. All 11 patients tested for the heparin-platelet factor 4 HIT antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening had positive results. All patients were hospitalized (10 in an intensive care unit [ICU]). As of April 21, 2021, outcomes were death (n = 3), continued ICU care (n = 3), continued non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharged home (n = 4).

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      The initial 12 US cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination represent serious events. This case series may inform clinical guidance as Ad26.COV2.S vaccination resumes in the US as well as investigations into the potential relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and CVST with thrombocytopenia.

  ref 'GOVUK_et_al_05_07_2021
    head = The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has issued advice to the UK government on the use of the coronavirus (COVID-19) Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged under 40. This has been considered alongside the latest advice from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on extremely rare cases of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

    quote !a = Considering this alongside the portfolio of vaccines available in the UK in the coming months and taking a precautionary approach in relation to the extremely small risk of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the JCVI has advised a preference for adults aged 30 to 39 without underlying health conditions to receive an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine – where available and only if this does not cause substantial delays in being vaccinated.

    / May, 2021 - Gov.UK
    quote !b = Up to 28 April 2021, the MHRA had received 242 reports of blood clotting cases in people who also had low levels of platelets in the UK, following the use of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. These numbers are very small compared to the millions of people who have received the vaccine. The overall incidence of case reports of thromboembolic events with low platelets after first or unknown doses was 10.5 per million doses.

    head = This variant harbors mutations in the RBD and other parts of the S protein that might alter important biological properties of the virus, including the efficiency of entry into target cells and the susceptibility to drugs and antibodies targeting the entry process. We analyzed whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses.
    >
      Summary
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although with moderate efficiency. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.

    quote !a = The present study reveals that the B.1.617 S protein can facilitate entry into Calu-3 lung and Caco-2 colon cells with slightly increased efficiency and shows that entry can be blocked by entry inhibitors: soluble ACE2 and Camostat.

    / May, 2021 - bioRxiv
    quote !b = In contrast, Bamlanivimab, a recombinant antibody with EUA did not inhibit entry driven by the B.1.617 S protein and evidence for moderate evasion of antibodies induced by infection and Comirnaty/BNT162b2 vaccination was obtained.

    / May, 2021 - bioRxiv
    quote !c = Our results suggest that although B.1.617 may be able to evade control by antibodies, to some extent other factors might contribute to its fast spread, including a potential fitness benefit or reduced adherence to COVID-19 protection measures (e.g. mask wearing and social distancing).

    quote !a = Following roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine from Astra-Zeneca, large-scale monitoring has picked up a potential link to a specific kind of blood clot. Cases of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) have also been recorded, but for the Astra-Zeneca vaccine, cases are very rare, perhaps because of precautions being taken for those with known allergies. Other side effects are so far thought to be short term. The MHRA data point to these specific blood clots being more common in younger people.

    / April, 2021 - Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication
    quote !b = The benefits of the vaccine are protection against COVID-19 (short-term and long COVID) - for the person being vaccinated and for those they come into contact with as it also reduces the chances of them being infected by the vaccinated person. These potential benefits, though, change according to: How likely a person is to be exposed to the virus (e.g. how prevalent the virus is, locally, at the time; what their occupational exposure is to it). How likely they are to have a poor outcome as a result of catching the virus (this is mostly affected by their age, but also underlying health conditions).

A vaccinated person will keep accruing this benefit over the lifetime of the vaccine’s protection. The risk from vaccination occurs only at the point of vaccination. This means that over time, the benefits will increase but the risks will not.

For every 1 person shown as being saved from ICU admission, there are many more who might be being saved from suffering hospitalization and ‘long COVID’. We are also not illustrating the benefit of not spreading the virus to others.

    quote !j = When making decisions, it is also important to take into account other potential vaccines available. For example, if there were an equally effective vaccine available, immediately, that did not carry the risk of a blood clot reaction then that might swing a decision in favour of taking that vaccine in preference to the Astra-Zeneca vaccine. However, if such a vaccine were not immediately available, then the risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus during each week of any delay before such an alternative were available would have to be weighed up in a decision whether to wait or not.

    quote !b = The MHRA’s scientific review of UK reports of extremely rare and unlikely to occur specific blood clots with lowered platelets has concluded that the evidence of a link with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is stronger but more work is still needed.

    / April, 2021 - Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
    quote !c = Up to and including 31 March 2021, the MHRA had received 79 UK reports of blood clotting cases alongside low levels of platelets following the use of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca: 44 of the 79 cases were of CVST with thrombocytopenia. 35 of the 79 cases were of thrombosis in other major veins with thrombocytopenia. 79 cases occurred in 51 women and 28 men, aged from 18 to 79 years. It should be noted that more women have been vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca than men. 19 people have died out of the 79 cases – 13 females and 6 males. 11 out of the 19 people who died were under the age of 50, 3 of whom were under 30. 14 of these 19 cases were of CVST with thrombocytopenia and 5 were of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. All 79 cases occurred after a first dose of the vaccine.

    quote !a = There have been reports of an extremely rare adverse event of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following vaccination with the first dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222).

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !b = There has been no signal for thrombosis/thrombocytopenia following receipt of other COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna).

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !c = Given the very low numbers of events reported overall, there is currently a high level of uncertainty in estimates of the incidence of this extremely rare adverse event by age group. However, the available data do suggest there may be a trend for increasing incidence of this adverse event with decreasing age, with a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !d = In contrast, the risks of severe disease associated with COVID-19 increases steeply with age, with the youngest adults at lowest risk. There are currently no known risk factors for this extremely rare condition, which appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction on first exposure to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !e = JCVI has weighed the relative balance of benefits and risks and advise that the benefits of prompt vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of adverse events for individuals 30 years of age and over and those who have underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !f = JCVI currently advises that it is preferable for adults aged <30 years without underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease, to be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available. People may make an informed choice to receive the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to receive earlier protection.

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !g = There are some adults <30 without underlying health conditions who are in phase 1, who were prioritised due to an increased risk of exposure and/or to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to vulnerable individuals. This includes health and social care workers, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals. Acting on a precautionary basis, if these persons are still unvaccinated, it is preferable for them to be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available.

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !h = To date, there are no reports of the extremely rare thrombosis/thrombocytopenia events following receipt of the second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. All those who have received a first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine should continue to be offered a second dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, irrespective of age. The second dose will be important for longer lasting protection against COVID-19.

    / April, 2021 - JCVI
    quote !i = JCVI advises that all individuals offered a COVID-19 vaccine should be fully informed about the benefits and risks of vaccination. This should include clear information on the extremely rare thrombosis/thrombocytopenia adverse event, how to monitor for symptoms that might be related to the adverse event, and what action should be taken by individuals and health professionals in the event of such symptoms arising.

  // Recurrent deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein drive antibody escape

    > Abstract
      Zoonotic pandemics, such as that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. The descendants of these viruses have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses. In the spike glycoprotein, we found that recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.

  // Mutations Strengthened SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.07.009

    head = We employ an algebraic topology-based machine learning model to quantitatively evaluate the binding free energy changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor following mutations.

    > Abtsract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic reopening. However, rigorous determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is very difficult owing to its continuous evolution with over 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in many subtypes. We employ an algebraic topology-based machine learning model to quantitatively evaluate the binding free energy changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor following mutations. We reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus becomes more infectious. Three out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become slightly more infectious, while the other three subtypes have significantly strengthened their infectivity. We also find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding free energy changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain, we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding free energy calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif, i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.

  // Identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations that attenuate monoclonal and serum antibody neutralization
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.01.014
  ref 'Liu_et_al_01_21_2021
    head = To define immune-selected mutations in the S protein, we exposed a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus, in which the VSV glycoprotein is replaced with the S protein, to 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and generated 50 different escape mutants.

    > Summary
      Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are a goal of COVID-19 vaccines and have received emergency use authorization as therapeutics. However, viral escape mutants could compromise efficacy. To define immune-selected mutations in the S protein, we exposed a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus, in which the VSV glycoprotein is replaced with the S protein, to 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and generated 50 different escape mutants. Each mAb had a unique resistance profile, although many shared residues within an epitope of the RBD. Some variants (e.g., S477N) were resistant to neutralization by multiple mAbs, whereas others (e.g., E484K) escaped neutralization by convalescent sera. Additionally, sequential selection identified mutants that escape neutralization by antibody cocktails. Comparing these antibody-mediated mutations with sequence variation in circulating SARS-CoV-2 revealed substitutions that may attenuate neutralizing immune responses in some humans and thus warrant further investigation.

  // The Impact of Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Spike on Viral Infectivity and Antigenicity

  ref 'Li_et_al_07_17_2020
    head = We investigated 80 variants and 26 glycosylation site modifications for the infectivity and reactivity to a panel of neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients.

    > Summary
      The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been undergoing mutations and is highly glycosylated. It is critically important to investigate the biological significance of these mutations. Here, we investigated 80 variants and 26 glycosylation site modifications for the infectivity and reactivity to a panel of neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients. D614G, along with several variants containing both D614G and another amino acid change, were significantly more infectious. Most variants with amino acid change at receptor binding domain were less infectious, but variants including A475V, L452R, V483A, and F490L became resistant to some neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the majority of glycosylation deletions were less infectious, whereas deletion of both N331 and N343 glycosylation drastically reduced infectivity, revealing the importance of glycosylation for viral infectivity. Interestingly, N234Q was markedly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whereas N165Q became more sensitive. These findings could be of value in the development of vaccine and therapeutic antibodies.

    head = We completely map all of the mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016.

    > Summary
      Monoclonal antibodies and antibody cocktails are a promising therapeutic and prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here, we completely map all of the mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escapes LY-CoV016). In addition, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to the antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

    head = The decision by Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) to delay the approval of Sputnik V is, unfortunately, of a political nature and has nothing to do with the regulator’s access to information or science. The regulator’s decision also contradicts an earlier decision by Brazil’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) which recognized the Sputnik V vaccine as safe and permitted its production in Brazil.

    / April, 2021 - Sputnik V
    quote !a = The Gamaleya Center, which carries out strict quality control of all Sputnik V production sites, has confirmed that no replication-competent adenoviruses (RCA) were ever found in any of the Sputnik V vaccine batches that have been produced. Existing quality controls ensure that no RCA can exist in Sputnik V vaccine. Prior to the inspection the Anvisa team received an official letter from the Gamaleya Center dated March 26, 2021 which clearly says: “In addition we would like to inform you that during the release of the vaccine product at the Center site and at the contract site of JBC Generium, not a single batch containing RCA was recorded.”

    / April, 2021 - Sputnik V
    quote !b = The quality and safety of Sputnik V are, among other things, assured by the fact that, unlike other vaccines, it uses a 4-stage purification technology that includes two stages of chromatography and two stages of tangential flow filtration. This purification technology helps to obtain a highly purified product that goes through mandatory quality control, including control for RCA or any additives presence. Control for RCA is carried out not only for the finished product but also at all stages of production, including the viral seed. Sputnik V team believes that its purification technology is the best among all vaccines and is one of the pillars for vaccine safety.

Hungary’s government published the official data comparing 5 vaccines used in Hungary. This data shows that Sputnik V is the most efficient and safe vaccine. The Mexican official government vaccination study confirms that Sputnik V is the safest vaccine with 7 times fewer adverse effects per doses administered than mRNA vaccines. The real-world data from Argentina’s Ministry of Health showed that COVID-19 infection rate after the 1st dose vaccination is 2 times lower for Sputnik V compared with other vaccines. No cases of deaths were registered in Argentina after full-doze Sputnik V vaccination.

    quote !a = The adenovirus vector vaccines (all of them so far in the pandemic – AZ/Oxford, J&J, Gamaleya, CanSino) are made by removing most of the adenovirus DNA instructions from some form of the virus, and inserting DNA to make coronavirus antigens instead. Oxford has a chimpanzee adenovirus, J&J has been using the Ad26 strain, CanSino has the Ad5 adenovirus, and the Gamaleya vaccine is one shot of Ad26 followed by a shot of Ad5. But all of them carry the DNA to make the coronavirus Spike protein (some of them in its native state, others with stabilizing amino acid mutations).

    / April, 2021 - Scienc Transalational Medicine
    quote !b = And all of them have had key parts of their original genome removed to make them unable to replicate in the body (deleting a gene called E1 is the standard way to do this).

    / April, 2021 - Scienc Transalational Medicine
    quote !c = That means that when you’re injected with such a vector vaccine, each viral particle is a one-shot deal. It infects a cell in your body and instructs it to make Spike protein (thereby setting off your immune response when that foreign protein gets presented), and that’s it. A real wild-type virus would of course make the whole suite of viral proteins, which would be assembled into countless new virus particles. These would then be released when the cell finally breaks apart and dies from the overload.

    / April, 2021 - Scienc Transalational Medicine
    quote !d = There have been debates over the years about whether you’d get a more effective vaccine that way, with a “replication-competent” adenovirus, but generally it’s believed that you can do fine with the “replication-incompetent” ones, which let you not give your patients a new viral infection at the same time.

    / April, 2021 - Scienc Transalational Medicine
    quote !e = Adenoviruses are everywhere. What happens when you’re infected with a wild-type variety? Generally you get respiratory infections that vary according to the person. With Ad5 and Ad26 they’re generally mild, sometimes unnoticeable, but in some people there can be serious trouble, which is another reason to avoid giving them replicating virus. The Ad5 variety has infected a solid proportion of the entire human race, as far as we can tell, which is one reason why you see people moving to less-common platforms like Ad26 or adenoviruses from other primate species entirely (as with Oxford/AZ).

    / April, 2021 - Scienc Transalational Medicine
    quote !f = It’s believed that if you already have antibodies and T-cells primed against the Ad5 vector itself (for example) that delivery of its payload will thus be impaired, leading to a less-effective vaccination.

    / April, 2021 - Scienc Transalational Medicine
    quote !g = This also makes you wonder about diminished efficacy of booster-shot regimens with such vectors, no matter what strain you start with, and what happens if you want to get vaccinated a few years later against a completely different pathogen whose vaccine uses a viral vector you’ve already been exposed to. For now, it looks like the booster-shot idea can work, although the second shot is surely chewed up more by the immune response.

    quote !h = We need to talk about how you make big piles of virus if you’ve kept them from replicating. That’s an interesting question that has a slick solution: you’re going to be using human cells (often the HEK293 line) to expand your virus production, and what you do is engineer those human cells so that they make the missing E1 protein that the virus needs to replicate. So as long as you’re growing up virus in these engineered cells, you’ll make more, but if they infect normal human cells that haven’t been jiggered to make a key viral protein (as in when you inject them as a vaccine) they’ll stall out on replication immediately.

    quote !i = There are still places where this can go wrong. Double-stranded DNA breaks, which can happen more or less randomly, are generally repaired by processes called “homologous recombination” and “nonhomologous end joining”, and these can lead to mix-and-match behavior between DNA from different sources. This process can be deliberately harnessed for gene editing – that’s what the classic CRISPR enzyme Cas9 does – but it can also be a source of trouble in a system like this one. There is a chance that the occasional viral particle might be able to regain the DNA sequence for the E1 protein by picking it up from the human-cell background. If that goes right (well, wrong), then that will turn it back into a replicating virus, and that’s just what it will do in your cell culture tanks.

There are assays to screen for this sort of thing, and every time work gets going on a proposed new viral vector, updated assays are developed to screen that one, too. You can dive into these references for details on how to engineer both your viral vectors and your human cell lines to cut down on the chances of this happening as well. This is an accepted part of the vector vaccine production process.

As mentioned, this is probably not going to cause big problems in its vaccinated population, but it’s a completely unnecessary risk. And if such a vaccine is going into tens of millions of people (or more), it seems certain that there will be some people harmed by this avoidable problem.

  // Acquisition of the L452R mutation in the ACE2-binding interface of Spike protein triggers recent massive expansion of SARS-Cov-2 variants
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.22.432189

    head = We investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois.

    > Abstract
      The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently. The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.

    quote !a = The Journal has now highlighted three independent descriptions of 39 persons with a newly described syndrome characterized by thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that developed 5 to 24 days after initial vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca). These persons were healthy or in medically stable condition, and very few were known to have had previous thrombosis or a preexisting prothrombotic condition. Most of the patients included in these reports were women younger than 50 years of age, some of whom were receiving estrogen-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !b = A remarkably high percentage of the patients had thromboses at unusual sites — specifically, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or thrombosis in the portal, splanchnic, or hepatic veins. Other patients presented with deep venous thrombi, pulmonary emboli, or acute arterial thromboses.

    quote !c = The median platelet counts at diagnosis were approximately 20,000 to 30,000 per cubic millimeter (range, approximately 10,000 to 110,000), but the rate of decline in platelet counts that preceded thrombosis is unknown. High levels of d-dimers and low levels of fibrinogen were common and suggest systemic activation of coagulation. Approximately 40% of the patients died, some from ischemic brain injury, superimposed hemorrhage, or both conditions, often after anticoagulation.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !d = This constellation of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia prompted consideration of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia as the diagnosis. However, none of the patients had known exposure to heparin before the onset of illness. Although the pathogenesis of this syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is not yet clear, certain findings were consistent across the three studies. In almost every patient, high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)–polyanion complexes were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as well by assays based on platelet activation, which, when tested, was enhanced by addition of PF4. In contrast to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, however, binding of antibody to PF4 occurred in the absence of heparin.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !e = This serologic pattern mirrors findings in patients with “atypical” or “autoimmune” heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, in whom thrombi develop in the absence of known previous exposure to heparin, but the distribution of thrombi in patients with that condition clearly differs from that in patients with VITT. On the basis of these reports, the diagnosis of VITT should be confirmed with an approved PF4 ELISA. Reliance cannot be placed on the rapid assays that are often used to detect heparin-induced thrombocytopenia unless they have been validated to make or to rule out a diagnosis of VITT, given the potential differences in antigenic target or sensitivity.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !f = The limited information available relating to management suggests that intravenous immune globulin and high-dose glucocorticoids can improve the platelet count within days, which may limit the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, especially when anticoagulation is instituted. Immune globulin impedes antibody-mediated platelet clearance and may down-regulate platelet activation by immune complexes by blocking platelet FcRγIIA receptors, as in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !g = Although the condition in several patients apparently improved when they were given low-molecular-weight heparin, it seems prudent to choose from among the nonheparin antithrombotic agents that are used to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia while the risk of bleeding is being mitigated. We expect that the high mortality rate associated with VITT will decrease with earlier recognition and improved intervention.

    quote !h = No thrombotic signal was detected in clinical trials leading to the approval of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which has now been administered to 34 million people worldwide. The incidence of VITT, as initially estimated, is perhaps 1 case per 100,000 exposures. This should be considered in the context of the incidence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in the general population (estimated at 0.22 to 1.57 cases per 100,000 per year).

Six possible cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (with or without splanchnic vein thrombosis) have been reported among the more than 7 million recipients of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen Ad26.COV2.S adenoviral vector vaccine. They clearly indicate the need for maintaining a high level of concern when patients present with central nervous system or abdominal symptoms after receiving any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

    quote !j = A note of caution: although anti-PF4–polyanion antibodies are common — for example, they are detected in 25 to 50% of patients after cardiovascular surgery — heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is not, and only in rare cases does cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or thrombi in abdominal vessels develop in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

    head = We assessed neutralizing Ab responses following natural infection or mRNA vaccination using pseudoviruses expressing the wildtype or the B.1.427/B.1.429 S protein.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 entry is mediated by the spike (S) glycoprotein which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) as the two main targets of neutralizing antibodies (Abs). A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429) was originally detected in California and is currently spreading throughout the US and 29 additional countries. It is unclear whether antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the prototypic Wuhan-1 isolate-based vaccines will be impacted by the three B.1.427/B.1.429 S mutations: S13I, W152C and L452R. Here, we assessed neutralizing Ab responses following natural infection or mRNA vaccination using pseudoviruses expressing the wildtype or the B.1.427/B.1.429 S protein. Plasma from vaccinated or convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, which were reduced 3-6 fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wildtype pseudoviruses. The RBD L452R mutation reduced or abolished neutralizing activity of 14 out of 35 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including three clinical-stage mAbs. Furthermore, we observed a complete loss of B.1.427/B.1.429 neutralization for a panel of mAbs targeting the N-terminal domain due to a large structural rearrangement of the NTD antigenic supersite involving an S13I-mediated shift of the signal peptide cleavage site. These data warrant closer monitoring of signal peptide variants and their involvement in immune evasion and show that Abs directed to the NTD impose a selection pressure driving SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution through conventional and unconventional escape mechanisms.

For example, the independent acquisition of the E484K mutation in the B.1.351, P.1, B.1.526 variants and more recently the B.1.1.7 variant suggests this could also occur in the B.1.427/B.1.429 lineages, as supported by the presence in GISAID of 4 genome sequences with the E484K RBD mutation in the B.1.427 variant. Alternatively, the S13I mutation could emerge in any of these variants.

  // An emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutant evading cellular immunity and increasing viral infectivity

    head = We demonstrate that two recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity escape and further reinforce the affinity to viral receptor ACE2.

    > Summary
      During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is devastating the modern societies worldwide, many variants that naturally acquire multiple mutations have emerged. Emerging mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has recently been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce the affinity to viral receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation increases protein stability, viral infectivity, and potentially promotes viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and the escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Therefore, these variants, particularly those possessing the L452R mutations, such as the B.1.427/429 lineage, can be the potential threat for these countries and regions with predominant HLA-A24 individuals.

  // Convergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations, L452R, E484Q and P681R, in the second wave of COVID-19 in Maharashtra, India
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.22.440932

    head = In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains.

    > Abstract
      As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains.

      Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding to selected monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation is warranted for accessing both ACE2 binding and the effectiveness of commonly elicited neutralizing mAbs for the strains of lineage B.1.617.

      The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a VOC.

  ref 'Shimabukuro_et_al_04_21_2021
    head = From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the “v-safe after vaccination health checker” surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons.

    > Background
      Many pregnant persons in the United States are receiving messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines, but data are limited on their safety in pregnancy.

    > Methods
      From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the “v-safe after vaccination health checker” surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons.

    > Results
      A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases).

    > Conclusions
      Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.

      We identified an emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant by viral whole-genome sequencing of 2,172 nasal/nasopharyngeal swab samples from 44 counties in California, a state in the Western United States. Named B.1.427/B.1.429 to denote its 2 lineages, the variant emerged in May 2020 and increased from 0% to >50% of sequenced cases from September 2020 to January 2021, showing 18.6-24% increased transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains. The variant carries 3 mutations in the spike protein, including an L452R substitution. We found 2-fold increased B.1.427/B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and increased L452R pseudovirus infection of cell cultures and lung organoids, albeit decreased relative to pseudoviruses carrying the N501Y mutation common to variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Antibody neutralization assays revealed 4.0 to 6.7-fold and 2.0-fold decreases in neutralizing titers from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients, respectively. The increased prevalence of a more transmissible variant in California exhibiting decreased antibody neutralization warrants further investigation.

    > Background
      The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector encoding full-length severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein in a prefusion-stabilized conformation.

    > Methods
      In an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adult participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 viral particles) or placebo. The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe–critical coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with an onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration among participants in the per-protocol population who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Safety was also assessed.

    > Results
      The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2–negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe–critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at ≥14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at ≥28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe–critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19–related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19–related).

    > Conclusions
      A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe–critical disease, including hospitalization and death. Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.

    > Abstract
      A safe, efficacious and deployable vaccine is urgently needed to control COVID-19 pandemic. We report here the preclinical development of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ZF2001, which contains tandem-repeat dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein with alum-based adjuvant. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). ZF2001 induced high levels of RBD-binding and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in both mice and NHPs, and also elicited balanced TH1/TH2 cellular responses in NHPs. Two doses of ZF2001 protected Ad-hACE2-transduced mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as detected by reduced viral RNA and relieved lung injuries. In NHPs, vaccination of either 25 μg or 50 μg ZF2001 prevented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in lung, trachea and bronchi, with milder lung lesions. No evidence of disease enhancement is observed in both models. ZF2001 is being evaluated in the ongoing international multi-center Phase 3 trials (NCT04646590) and has been approved for emergency use in Uzbekistan.

    > Abstract
      Studies on the real-life effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention are urgently needed. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021. We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020. To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities. A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization. This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities. Our analysis demonstrates the real-life effect of a national vaccination campaign on the pandemic dynamics.

  // Towards Understanding ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)
  doi: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-440461/v1
  ref 'Greinacher_et_al_04_20_2021
    head = We investigated vaccine, PF4, and VITT patient-derived anti-PF4 antibody interactions using dynamic light scattering, 3D-super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy.

    > Background
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 rarely causes vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) that—like autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia—is mediated by platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies.

    > Methods
      We investigated vaccine, PF4, and VITT patient-derived anti-PF4 antibody interactions using dynamic light scattering, 3D-super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry was used to analyze vaccine composition. We investigated the mechanism for early post-vaccine inflammatory reactions as potential co-stimulant for anti-PF4 immune response. Finally, we evaluated VITT antibodies for inducing release of procoagulant DNA-containing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and measured DNase activity in VITT patient serum.

    > Results
      Biophysical analyses showed formation of complexes between PF4 and vaccine constituents, including virus proteins that were recognized by VITT antibodies. EDTA, a vaccine constituent, increased microvascular leakage in mice allowing for circulation of virus- and virus-producing cell culture-derived proteins. Antibodies in normal sera cross-reacted with human proteins in the vaccine and likely contribute to commonly observed acute ChAdOx1 nCov-19 post-vaccination inflammatory reactions. Polyphosphates and DNA enhanced PF4-dependent platelet activation by VITT antibodies. In the presence of platelets, PF4 enhanced VITT antibody-driven procoagulant NETs formation, while DNase activity was reduced in VITT sera, with granulocyte-rich cerebral vein thrombosis observed in a VITT patient.

    > Conclusions
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine constituents (i) form antigenic complexes with PF4, (ii) EDTA increases microvascular permeability, and (iii) vaccine components cause acute inflammatory reactions. Antigen formation in a proinflammatory milieu offers an explanation for anti-PF4 antibody production. High-titer anti-PF4 antibodies activate platelets and induce neutrophil activation and NETs formation, fueling the VITT prothrombotic response.

  ref 'Goel_et_al_04_15_2021
    head = We interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects.

    > Abstract
      Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized for emergency use. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-404769/v1
  ref 'Greinacher_et_al_2021
    head = Sera from 222 PCR-confirmed Covid-19 patients from five European centers were tested by PF4/heparin ELISA, heparin-dependent and PF4-dependent platelet activation assays. Immunogenic reactivity of purified anti-PF4 and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies from patients with VITT were tested against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

    > Background
      Some recipients of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca develop antibody-mediated vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), associated with cerebral venous and other unusual thrombosis resembling autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A prothrombotic predisposition is also observed in Covid-19. We explored whether antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induced by Covid-19 cross-react with platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXLC4), the protein targeted in both VITT and autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

    > Methods
      Immunogenic epitopes of PF4 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were compared via prediction tools and 3D modelling software (IMED, SIM, MacMYPOL). Sera from 222 PCR-confirmed Covid-19 patients from five European centers were tested by PF4/heparin ELISA, heparin-dependent and PF4-dependent platelet activation assays. Immunogenic reactivity of purified anti-PF4 and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies from patients with VITT were tested against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

    > Results
      Three motifs within the spike protein sequence share a potential immunogenic epitope with PF4. Nineteen of 222 (8.6%) Covid-19 patient sera tested positive in the IgG-specific PF4/heparin ELISA, none of which showed platelet activation in the heparin-dependent activation assay, including 10 (4.5%) of the 222 Covid-19 patients who developed thromboembolic complications. Purified anti-PF4 and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies from two VITT patients did not show cross-reactivity to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

    > Conclusions
      The antibody responses to PF4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca differ. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein do not cross-react with PF4 or PF4/heparin complexes through molecular mimicry. These findings make it very unlikely that the intended vaccine-induced immune response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would itself induce VITT.

    quote !a = Increasing air changes per hour and air filtration is a simplified but important concept that could be deployed to help reduce risk from within-room, far-field airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infectious diseases. Healthy building controls like higher ventilation and enhanced filtration are a fundamental, but often overlooked, part of risk reduction strategies that could have benefit beyond the current pandemic.

    / April, 2021 - JAMA
    quote !b = To reduce far-field airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in small-volume indoor spaces (eg, classrooms, retail shops, homes if guests are visiting), the suggestions include targeting 4 to 6 air changes per hour, through any combination of the following: outdoor air ventilation; recirculated air that passes through a filter with at least a minimum efficiency rating value 13 (MERV 13) rating; or passage of air through portable air cleaners with HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters.

    / April, 2021 - JAMA
    quote !c = The existing minimum standards for ACH vary based on building type. For example, according to ASHRAE, the predominant standard-setting organization for ventilation rates, the minimum required total ACH that occur in most households is 0.35 ACH of outdoor air, and schools should be designed for approximately 10 times higher rates, although most schools do not meet this in practice. The suggestion for increasing the target to 4 to 6 ACH is more consistent with rates set in hospitals, where the higher ACH requirements underscore the potential role of air change rates as an infection control strategy.

    / April, 2021 - JAMA
    quote !d = Despite the dose-response for SARS-CoV-2 being unknown, and continued scientific debate about the dominant mode of transmission, evidence support these suggestions. First, SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted from the exhaled respiratory aerosols of infected individuals. Larger droplets (>100 μm) can settle out of the air due to gravitational forces within 6 feet, but people emit 100 times more smaller aerosols (<5 μm) during talking, breathing, and coughing. Smaller aerosols can stay aloft for 30 minutes to hours and travel well beyond 6 feet.1 Second, high-profile and well-described SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across multiple space types (eg, restaurants, gyms, choir practice, schools, buses) share the common features of time indoors and low levels of ventilation, even when people remained physically distanced.

    / April, 2021 - JAMA
    quote !e = Higher ventilation and filtration rates more rapidly remove particles from indoor air, thereby reducing the intensity of exposure and duration that respiratory aerosols stay aloft inside a room. Fourth, this approach is consistent with what is used in hospitals to minimize risk of transmission. Fifth, reviews on the relationship between ventilation and infectious diseases found that the weight of evidence indicates ventilation plays a key role in infectious disease transmission, citing observational epidemiological studies showing low ventilation associated with transmission of measles, tuberculosis, rhinovirus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-1

    head = Manufacturers response to a case report by Muir et al that describes thrombosis, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), associated with severe thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation in a recipient of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) against SARS-CoV-2.

    quote !a = Among the more than 75,000 participants in the clinical trial program for our Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (of which approximately 50,000 received active vaccine), a single case of CVST with thrombocytopenia occurred in a vaccine recipient. We paused our program to review this case from our first phase 3 study; after consultation with external clinical experts, no clear causality was established, and the data and safety monitoring board agreed that we could restart the study. The vaccine recipient was subsequently found to have had antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) at the time of the event, a finding similar to that in the case described by Muir and colleagues.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !b = As part of our postauthorization pharmacovigilance program, Janssen ongoing safety surveillance received reports of six cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia occurring 7 to 14 days after vaccination, including the case described by Muir et al. On April 13, 2021, in an abundance of caution, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a pause in vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in the United States to allow further study of the situation and to provide physicians. These cases were reported among more than 7.2 million persons who had been vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S globally as of April 14, 2021. Thus, the reporting rate is less than 1 in 1,000,000 vaccinations, though it is possible that the cases are underreported.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !c = At this time, evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. CVST is a very rare health condition, and thus far, events reported in recipients of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are occurring within the range of published background incidence (0.2 to 1.57 per 100,000 person-years). It is important to note that the incidence of CVST associated with low platelets is unknown and is considered by the FDA and the CDC to be extremely low.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !d = Muir et al. suggested that coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines using an adenoviral (Ad) vector platform may be related to the occurrence of thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Recent reports by Greinacher et al. and Schultz et al. concluded that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford–AstraZeneca) may lead to rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia. The vectors and spike (S) protein inserts used in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are substantially different.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !e = The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine uses a human Ad26–based vector, whereas the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus–based vector. Ad26 is from Ad species D and can engage CD46 as its cellular receptor, whereas ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is from Ad species E and uses the Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and possibly other molecules as its cellular receptors; these two vectors thus use different host cell receptors and are likely to have different phylogenetic and biologic characteristics.

    / April, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !f = In addition, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine transgene codes for a membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein (prefusion conformation–stabilized by two proline substitutions) that does not shed S1, most likely as a consequence of knocking out the furin cleavage site, which is different from the unmodified S protein encoded by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Therefore, these two adenoviral vector Covid-19 vaccines may have quite different biologic effects. More evidence is needed to clarify the observation of thrombotic thrombocytopenia in persons receiving a vaccine against Covid-19.

  // Pathologic Antibodies to Platelet Factor 4 after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2105385
  ref 'Scully_et_al_04_16_2021
    head = We report findings in 23 patients who presented with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 6 to 24 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca).

    > Background
      The mainstay of control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Within a year, several vaccines have been developed and millions of doses delivered. Reporting of adverse events is a critical postmarketing activity.

    > Methods
      We report findings in 23 patients who presented with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 6 to 24 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca). On the basis of their clinical and laboratory features, we identify a novel underlying mechanism and address the therapeutic implications.

    > Results
      In the absence of previous prothrombotic medical conditions, 22 patients presented with acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, primarily cerebral venous thrombosis, and 1 patient presented with isolated thrombocytopenia and a hemorrhagic phenotype. All the patients had low or normal fibrinogen levels and elevated d-dimer levels at presentation. No evidence of thrombophilia or causative precipitants was identified. Testing for antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) was positive in 22 patients (with 1 equivocal result) and negative in 1 patient. On the basis of the pathophysiological features observed in these patients, we recommend that treatment with platelet transfusions be avoided because of the risk of progression in thrombotic symptoms and that the administration of a nonheparin anticoagulant agent and intravenous immune globulin be considered for the first occurrence of these symptoms.

    > Conclusions
      Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains critical for control of the Covid-19 pandemic. A pathogenic PF4-dependent syndrome, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, can occur after the administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Rapid identification of this rare syndrome is important because of the therapeutic implications.

  // Alterations in T and B cell function persist in convalescent COVID-19 patients
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2021.03.013
  ref 'Shuwa_et_al_03_31_2021
    head = We conducted an observational study examining lymphocyte populations in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization and at up to 6 months of convalescence.

    > Background
      Emerging studies indicate that some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients suffer from persistent symptoms, including breathlessness and chronic fatigue; however, the long-term immune response in these patients presently remains ill-defined.

    > Methods
      Here, we describe the phenotypic and functional characteristics of B and T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients during acute disease and at 3–6 months of convalescence.

    > Findings
      We report that the alterations in B cell subsets observed in acute COVID-19 patients were largely recovered in convalescent patients. In contrast, T cells from convalescent patients displayed continued alterations with persistence of a cytotoxic program evident in CD8+ T cells as well as elevated production of type 1 cytokines and interleukin-17 (IL-17). Interestingly, B cells from patients with acute COVID-19 displayed an IL-6/IL-10 cytokine imbalance in response to Toll-like receptor activation, skewed toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Whereas the frequency of IL-6+ B cells was restored in convalescent patients irrespective of clinical outcome, the recovery of IL-10+ B cells was associated with the resolution of lung pathology.

    > Conclusions
      Our data detail lymphocyte alterations in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to 6 months following hospital discharge and identify 3 subgroups of convalescent patients based on distinct lymphocyte phenotypes, with 1 subgroup associated with poorer clinical outcome. We propose that alterations in B and T cell function following hospitalization with COVID-19 could affect longer-term immunity and contribute to some persistent symptoms observed in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !a = We propose that it is a scientific error to use lack of direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in some air samples to cast doubt on airborne transmission while overlooking the quality and strength of the overall evidence base. There is consistent, strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads by airborne transmission. Although other routes can contribute, we believe that the airborne route is likely to be dominant.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !b = First, superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission; indeed, such events may be the pandemic's primary drivers. Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions, room sizes, ventilation, and other variables in choir concerts, cruise ships, slaughterhouses, care homes, and correctional facilities, among other settings, have shown patterns—eg, long-range transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number (R0), discussed below—consistent with airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 that cannot be adequately explained by droplets or fomites.6 The high incidence of such events strongly suggests the dominance of aerosol transmission.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !c = Second, long-range transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people in adjacent rooms but never in each other's presence has been documented in quarantine hotels. Historically, it was possible to prove long-range transmission only in the complete absence of community transmission.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !d = Third, asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing is likely to account for at least a third, and perhaps up to 59%, of all transmission globally and is a key way SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world, supportive of a predominantly airborne mode of transmission.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !e = Direct measurements show that speaking produces thousands of aerosol particles and few large droplets, which supports the airborne route.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !f = Fourth, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher indoors than outdoors and is substantially reduced by indoor ventilation. Both observations support a predominantly airborne route of transmission.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !g = Fifth, nosocomial infections have been documented in health-care organisations, where there have been strict contact-and-droplet precautions and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to protect against droplet but not aerosol exposure.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !h = Sixth, viable SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the air. In laboratory experiments, SARS-CoV-2 stayed infectious in the air for up to 3 h with a half-life of 1·1 h.12 Viable SARS-CoV-2 was identified in air samples from rooms occupied by COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-generating health-care procedures and in air samples from an infected person's car. Although other studies have failed to capture viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples, this is to be expected.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !i = Sampling of airborne virus is technically challenging for several reasons, including limited effectiveness of some sampling methods for collecting fine particles, viral dehydration during collection, viral damage due to impact forces (leading to loss of viability), reaerosolisation of virus during collection, and viral retention in the sampling equipment. Measles and tuberculosis, two primarily airborne diseases, have never been cultivated from room air.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !j = Seventh, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in air filters and building ducts in hospitals with COVID-19 patients; such locations could be reached only by aerosols.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !k = Eighth, studies involving infected caged animals that were connected to separately caged uninfected animals via an air duct have shown transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that can be adequately explained only by aerosols.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !l = Ninth, no study to our knowledge has provided strong or consistent evidence to refute the hypothesis of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Some people have avoided SARS-CoV-2 infection when they have shared air with infected people, but this situation could be explained by a combination of factors, including variation in the amount of viral shedding between infectious individuals by several orders of magnitude and different environmental (especially ventilation) conditions.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !m = Wide variation in respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 counters arguments that SARS-CoV-2 cannot be airborne because the virus has a lower R0 (estimated at around 2·5)21 than measles (estimated at around 15),22 especially since R0, which is an average, does not account for the fact that only a minority of infectious individuals shed high amounts of virus. Overdispersion of R0 is well documented in COVID-19.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !n = Tenth, there is limited evidence to support other dominant routes of transmission—ie, respiratory droplet or fomite.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !o = Ease of infection between people in close proximity to each other has been cited as proof of respiratory droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, close-proximity transmission in most cases along with distant infection for a few when sharing air is more likely to be explained by dilution of exhaled aerosols with distance from an infected person.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !p = The flawed assumption that transmission through close proximity implies large respiratory droplets or fomites was historically used for decades to deny the airborne transmission of tuberculosis and measles. This became medical dogma, ignoring direct measurements of aerosols and droplets which reveal flaws such as the overwhelming number of aerosols produced in respiratory activities and the arbitrary boundary in particle size of 5 μm between aerosols and droplets, instead of the correct boundary of 100 μm.

    / April, 2021 - The Lancet
    quote !q = It is sometimes argued that since respiratory droplets are larger than aerosols, they must contain more viruses. However, in diseases where pathogen concentrations have been quantified by particle size, smaller aerosols showed higher pathogen concentrations than droplets when both were measured.

  // BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Mass Vaccination Setting
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765
  ref 'Dagan_et_al_04_15_2021
    head = In this study, data from Israel’s largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

    > Background
      As mass vaccination campaigns against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) commence worldwide, vaccine effectiveness needs to be assessed for a range of outcomes across diverse populations in a noncontrolled setting. In this study, data from Israel’s largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

    > Methods
      All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19–related hospitalization, severe illness, and death. We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan–Meier estimator.

    > Results
      Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions.

    > Conclusions
      This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19–related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.

      Extended-interval Covid vaccination regimens are now used widely in order to accelerate population coverage but the relative immunogenicity of different vaccines in older people remains uncertain.

    > Methods
      We recruited 165 participants aged 80+ years who had received a single dose of either BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 adenovirus vaccine and studied adaptive immune responses after 5 weeks.

    > Findings
      Antibody responses against spike protein were detectable in 93% and 87% of mRNA or ChAdOx1 recipients respectively with median antibody titres of 19.3 and 19.6 U/ml (p=0.41). Spike-specific T cell responses were observed in 12% and 31% of mRNA and ChAdOx1 recipients respectively and median responses were 3-fold higher in ChAdOx1 vaccinees at 2 vs 6 spots/million respectively (p=<0.0001). Humoral and cellular immune responses against spike were correlated in both cohorts. Evidence of previous natural infection was seen in 8 donors and associated with 691-fold and 4-fold increase in humoral and cellular immune responses across the whole cohort.

    > Interpretation
      Single doses of either the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1vaccine in older people thus induce humoral immunity in most donors and are markedly enhanced by previous infection. Cellular responses are weaker but show relative enhancement after the ChAdOx1 platform.

  ref 'Taquet_et_al_04_15_2021
    head = Using an electronic health records network we estimated the absolute incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in the two weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis (N=513,284), or influenza (N=172,742), or receipt of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines (N=489,871).

    > Abstract
      Using  an  electronic  health  records  network  we  estimated  the  absolute  incidence  of  cerebral  venous thrombosis  (CVT)  in  the  two  weeks  following  COVID-19  diagnosis(N=513,284),or  influenza (N=172,742),or  receipt  of  the  BNT162b2  or  mRNA-1273  COVID-19  vaccines(N=489,871).The incidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was also assessed in these groups, as well asthe baseline CVTincidence over a two-week period. The incidence of CVT after COVID-19 diagnosis was 39.0 per million people (95% CI, 25.2–60.2). This was higher than the CVT incidence after influenza (0.0 per million people, 95% CI 0.0–22.2, adjusted RR=6.73, P=.003) or after receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine (4.1 per million people, 95% CI 1.1–14.9, adjusted RR=6.36, P<.001). The relative risks were similar if a broader definition of CVT was used. For PVT, the incidence was 436.4 per million people  (382.9-497.4)  after  COVID-19,  98.4  (61.4-157.6)  after  influenza,  and  44.9  (29.7-68.0) after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. The incidence of CVT following COVID-19 was higher than the incidence observed across the entire health records network (0.41 per million people over any 2-week period). Laboratory test results, availablein a subsetof the COVID-19 patients,provide preliminary evidence suggestive  of raised  D-dimer,  lowered  fibrinogen,  and  an  increased  rate  of  thrombocytopenia  in  the CVT and PVT groups. Mortality was 20% and 18.8% respectively. These data show that the incidence of CVT issignificantly increased after COVID-19,and greater than that observed with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines. The risk of CVT following COVID-19 is also higher than the latest estimate from the European Medicines Agency for theincidence associated withChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (5.0 per million people, 95% CI 4.3–5.8). Although requiring replication and corroboration, the present data highlight the risk of serious thrombotic events in COVID-19, and can help contextualizethe risks and benefits of vaccinationin this regard

    head = We report an unusual presentation characterized by catastrophic cerebral venous thrombosis in three patients younger than 41 years of age, previously healthy patients, infected with SARS CoV 2, previously healthy and potentially without antecedent cardiopulmonary symptoms or fever.

    > Abstract
      Despite the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) being more frequently related to acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute cardiac and renal injuries, thromboembolic events have been increasingly reported. We report a unique series of young patients with COVID-19 presenting with cerebral venous system thrombosis. Three patients younger than 41 years of age with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection had neurologic findings related to cerebral venous thrombosis. They were admitted during the short period of 10 days between March and April 2020 and were managed in an academic institution in a large city. One patient had thrombosis in both the superficial and deep systems; another had involvement of the straight sinus, vein of Galen, and internal cerebral veins; and a third patient had thrombosis of the deep medullary veins. Two patients presented with hemorrhagic venous infarcts. The median time from COVID-19 symptoms to a thrombotic event was 7 days (range, 2–7 days). One patient was diagnosed with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis, and another one used oral contraceptive pills. Two patients were managed with both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; one was treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. All patients had a fatal outcome. Severe and potentially fatal deep cerebral thrombosis may complicate the initial clinical presentation of COVID-19. We urge awareness of this atypical manifestation.

  // Autoimmune heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.13813
  ref 'Greinacher_et_al_08_28_2017
    head = Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a prothrombotic adverse drug reaction, is caused by the transient production of platelet‐activating antibodies of IgG class that recognize multimolecular complexes of (cationic) platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to (polyanionic) heparin.

    > Abstract
      Autoimmune heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (aHIT) indicates the presence in patients of anti‐platelet factor 4 (PF4)–polyanion antibodies that are able to activate platelets strongly even in the absence of heparin (heparin‐independent platelet activation). Nevertheless, as seen with serum obtained from patients with otherwise typical heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), serum‐induced platelet activation is inhibited at high heparin concentrations (10–100 IU mL−1 heparin). Furthermore, upon serial dilution, aHIT serum will usually show heparin‐dependent platelet activation. Clinical syndromes associated with aHIT include: delayed‐onset HIT, persisting HIT, spontaneous HIT syndrome, fondaparinux‐associated HIT, heparin ‘flush’‐induced HIT, and severe HIT (platelet count of < 20 × 109 L−1) with associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Recent studies have implicated anti‐PF4 antibodies that are able to bridge two PF4 tetramers even in the absence of heparin, probably facilitated by non‐heparin platelet‐associated polyanions (chondroitin sulfate and polyphosphates); nascent PF4–aHIT‐IgG complexes recruit additional heparin‐dependent HIT antibodies, leading to the formation of large multimolecular immune complexes and marked platelet activation. aHIT can persist for several weeks, and serial fibrin, D‐dimer, and fibrinogen levels, rather than the platelet count, may be helpful for monitoring treatment response. Although standard anticoagulant therapy for HIT ought to be effective, published experience indicates frequent failure of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)‐adjusted anticoagulants (argatroban, bivalirudin), probably because of underdosing in the setting of HIT‐associated DIC, known as ‘APTT confounding’. Thus, non‐APTT‐adjusted therapies with drugs such as danaparoid and fondaparinux, or even direct oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban or apixaban, are suggested therapies, especially for long‐term management of persisting HIT. In addition, emerging data indicate that high‐dose intravenous immunoglobulin can interrupt HIT antibody‐induced platelet activation, leading to rapid platelet count recovery.

  // High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a review
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2019.1636645
  ref 'Warkentin_et_al_07_05_2019
    head = This article focuses on the scientific rationale for IVIG as an adjunct treatment for HIT. Further, the author presents a new illustrative case, review the available literature, and provides his opinions on how this treatment might evolve over time.


    > ABSTRACT
      Introduction: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is known for its strong association with thrombosis and distinct pathogenesis involving anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies that activate platelets strongly through clustering of platelet FcγIIa receptors. Autoimmune HIT (aHIT) refers to a subgroup of patients whose HIT antibodies have both heparin-dependent and heparin-independent platelet-activating properties. aHIT patients have atypical clinical presentations including delayed-onset HIT, persisting (refractory) HIT, heparin ‘flush’ HIT, fondaparinux-associated HIT, severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 × 109/L) with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation, and spontaneous HIT syndrome.

      Areas covered: This article reviews all available literature describing the use of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an adjunct treatment to anticoagulation in HIT patients. IVIG is usually effective in interrupting platelet activation by aHIT antibodies, manifesting as a rapid platelet count increase after starting IVIG (usual dose, 1g/kg × 2 days). Experience to date suggests IVIG de-escalates HIT and likely reduces thrombotic risk. A new case of aHIT successfully treated with IVIG is presented. Use of IVIG to prevent acute HIT with planned heparin reexposure in antibody-positive patients is also discussed.

      Expert opinion: High-dose IVIG appears to rapidly inhibit HIT antibody-induced platelet activation and has the potential to become an important treatment adjunct for HIT, particularly in patients with aHIT.

    / July, 2019 - Expert Review of Hematology
    quote !b = High-dose IVIG has been used anecdotally since 1989 to treat acute HIT. During this 30-year period, 36 patients have been reported as receiving IVIG for treating acute HIT. In all cases, IVIG use was considered adjunctive to alternative anticoagulation. Although the publication of only approximately 1 case per year might suggest that this therapy is only rarely performed, the recent and growing recognition of aHIT syndromes, and the appreciation that heparin-independent HIT antibody-induced platelet activation is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by high-dose IVIG, suggests that this therapy might become increasingly common in the future, particularly in patients with severe and atypical clinical presentations of HIT.

    / July, 2019 - Expert Review of Hematology
    quote !c = In my view, it is rational to use a two-pronged treatment approach in such patients: (a) substitution of heparin with an effective, non-heparin alternative anticoagulant, and (b) administration of high-dose IVIG to inhibit HIT antibody-induced platelet activation. Since heparin itself has a short half-life, and since heparin is usually discontinued in patients with HIT, it is the inhibition of heparin-independent platelet activation by IVIG that is central to the rationale for use of IVIG in treatment of HIT.

    / July, 2019 - Expert Review of Hematology
    quote !d = Based on the reported experience to date, as well as theoretical considerations (dose-dependent inhibitory effect), I recommend that a standard dosing regimen of 1 g/kg × 2 days (i.e. 1 g/kg on day 1, and a further dose of 1 g/kg on day 2), calculated using ‘dosing weight’ rather than ‘ideal body weight’ [78], be given in most situations.

  // Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2104882
  ref 'Schultz_et_al_04_09_2021
    head = We describe the vaccine-induced syndrome of severe thrombosis and thrombocytopenia found among these five patients admitted to Oslo University Hospital.

    > Summary
      We report findings in five patients who presented with venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 7 to 10 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patients were health care workers who were 32 to 54 years of age. All the patients had high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4–polyanion complexes; however, they had had no previous exposure to heparin. Because the five cases occurred in a population of more than 130,000 vaccinated persons, we propose that they represent a rare vaccine-related variant of spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia that we refer to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.

  // Thrombotic thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840
  ref 'Greinacher_et_al_04_09_2021
    head = We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)–heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions.

    > Background
      Several cases of unusual thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia have developed after vaccination with the recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the spike protein antigen of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (ChAdOx1 nCov-19, AstraZeneca). More data were needed on the pathogenesis of this unusual clotting disorder.

    > Methods
      We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)–heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4–heparin immunoassay.

    > Results
      Of the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49). Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died. Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset. All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4–heparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin. Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptor–blocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter). Additional studies with PF4 or PF4–heparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation.

    > Conclusion
      Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Although treatment decisions such as administering intravenous immune globulin and starting anticoagulation do not need to await laboratory diagnosis, detection of these unusual platelet-activating antibodies will be highly relevant for case identification and future risk–benefit assessment of this and other vaccines.

  // Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD-based protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) against COVID-19 in adults: two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00127-4
  ref 'Yang_et_al_03_24_2021
    head = We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. The mean age of participants was 32·6. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. The mean age of participants was 43·5 years.


    > Background
      Although several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed so far, they will not be sufficient to meet the global demand. Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19 using a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study.

    > Methods
      We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18–59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing.

    > Findings
      Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 μg vaccine (n=20), or the 50 μg vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 32·6 (SD 9·4) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 μg vaccine (n=150), or 50 μg vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 μg vaccine (n=150), or 50 μg vaccine (n=150). The mean age of participants was 43·5 (SD 9·2) years. In both phase 1 and phase 2, adverse events reported within 30 days after vaccination were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in most cases (phase 1: six [60%] of ten participants in the placebo group, 14 [70%] of 20 in the 25 μg group, and 18 [90%] of 20 in the 50 μg group; phase 2: 37 [25%] of 150 in the two-dose placebo group, 43 [29%] of 150 in the two-dose 25 μg group, 50 [33%] of 150 in the two-dose 50 μg group, 47 [31%] of 150 in the three-dose placebo group, 72 [48%] of 150 in the three-dose 25 μg group, and 65 [43%] of 150 in the three-dose 50 μg group). In phase 1, two (10%) grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in the 50 μg group. In phase 2, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported by 18 participants (four [3%] in the two-dose 25 μg vaccine group, two [1%] in the two-dose 50 μg vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, four [3%] in the three-dose 25 μg vaccine group, and six [4%] in the three-dose 50 μg vaccine group), and 11 were considered vaccine related (two [1%] in the two-dose 25 μg vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 μg vaccine group, one [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, two [1%] in the three-dose 25 μg vaccine group, and five [3%] in the three-dose 50 μg vaccine group); seven participants reported serious adverse events (one [1%] in the two-dose 25 μg vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 μg vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, one [1%] in the three-dose 25 μg vaccine group, and two [1%] in the three-dose 50 μg vaccine group), but none was considered vaccine related. In phase 2, on the two-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the second dose were 76% (114 of 150 participants) in the 25 μg group and 72% (108 of 150) in the 50 μg group; on the three-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the third dose were 97% (143 of 148 participants) in the 25 μg group and 93% (138 of 148) in the 50 μg group. In the two-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the second dose were 17·7 (95% CI 13·6–23·1) in the 25 μg group and 14·1 (10·8–18·3) in the 50 μg group. In the three-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the third dose were 102·5 (95% CI 81·8–128·5) in the 25 μg group and 69·1 (53·0–90·0) in the 50 μg group.

    > Interpretation
      The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 appears to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 and 2 trials support the use of the 25 μg dose in a three-dose schedule in an ongoing phase 3 trial for large-scale evaluation of ZF2001's safety and efficacy.

  // SARS-Cov-2RNA found on particulate matter of Bergamo in Northern Italy: First evidence
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109754
  ref 'Setti_et_al_2020
    head = We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period.

    > Background
      The burden of COVID-19 was extremely severe in Northern Italy, an area characterized by high concentrations of particulate matter (PM), which is known to negatively affect human health. Consistently with evidence already available for other viruses, we initially hypothesized the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 presence on PM, and we performed a first experiment specifically aimed at confirming or excluding this research hyphotesys.

    > Methods
      We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period. Filters were properly stored and underwent RNA extraction and amplification according to WHO protocols in two parallel blind analyses performed by two different authorized laboratories. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (E, N, and RdRP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on particulate matter.

    > Results
      The first test showed positive results for gene E in 15 out of 16 samples, simultaneously displaying positivity also for RdRP gene in 4 samples. The second blind test got 5 additional positive results for at least one of the three marker genes. Overall, we tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 20 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers. Control tests to exclude false positivities were successfully accomplished.

    > Conclusion
      This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on PM, thus suggesting a possible use as indicator of epidemic recurrence.

  // SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN)
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00675-9
  ref 'Hall_et_al_04_09_2021
    head = We have presented the interim findings after 7 months of follow-up from the SIREN study (SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study), a unique, large-scale, multicentre, prospective cohort study of health-care staff undergoing frequent asymptomatic testing, powered to detect and characterise reinfections and estimate the protective effect of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study.


    > Background
      Increased understanding of whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infection is an urgent requirement. We aimed to investigate whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection.

    > Methods
      A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12 months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2–4 weeks) and completed questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status, depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection rates in the two cohorts.

    > Findings
      From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913 were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11, 2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047 113 person-days of follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436 person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7·6 reinfections per 100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57·3 primary infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June, 2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0·159 for all reinfections (95% CI 0·13–0·19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than 200 days.

    > Interpretation
      A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 84% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective immunity to future infections in most individuals.

  // Reopening Italy’s Schools in September 2020: A Bayesian Estimation of the Change in the Growth Rate of New SARS-CoV-2 Cases
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254993
  ref 'Casini_et_al_04_09_2021
    head = We have applied a piecewise regression to the number of new daily CoViD-19 cases since September 1st, 2020 in order to highlight the start of the second wave and relate it to the reopening of schools in Italy.

    > Objectives
      CoViD-19’s second wave started a debate on the potential role of schools as a primary factor in the contagion resurgence. Two opposite positions appeared: those convinced that schools played a major role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 infections and those who were not. We studied the growth rate of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in all the Italian regions, before and after the school reopening (September - October 2020), investigating the hypothesis of an association between schools and the resurgence of the virus in Italy.

    > Methods
      Using Bayesian piecewise linear regression to scrutinize the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections in each Italian, we looked for an estimate of a changepoint in the growth rate of those confirmed cases. We compared the changepoints with the school opening dates, for each Italian region. The regression allows to discuss the change in steepness of the infection curve, before and after the changepoint.

    > Results
      In 15 out of 21 Italian regions (71%), an estimated change in the rate of growth of the total number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infection cases occurred after an average of 16.66 days (CI 95% 14.47 to 18.73) since the school reopening. The number of days required for the SARS-CoV-2 daily cases to double went from an average of 47.50 days (CI 95% 37.18 to 57.61) before the changepoint to an average of 7.72 days (CI 95% 7.00 to 8.48) after it.

    > Conclusion
      Studying the rate of growth of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in all the Italian regions provides some evidence in favor of a link between school reopening and the resurgence of the virus in Italy. The number of factors that could have played a role are too many to give a definitive answer. Still, the temporal correspondence warrants for a controlled experiment to clarify how much reopening schools mattered.

    head = We performed a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of an inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac, in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Manaus, where P.1 accounted for 75% of genotyped SARS-CoV-2 samples at the peak of its epidemic. Information from electronic surveillance databases was used to select cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched test-negative controls from 19 January, 2021 to 25 March, 2021.

    > Background
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant P.1 emerged in the city of Manaus in late 2020 during a large resurgence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and has spread throughout Brazil. The effectiveness of vaccines in settings with widespread P.1 transmission has not been reported.

    > Methods
      We performed a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of an inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac, in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Manaus, where P.1 accounted for 75% of genotyped SARS-CoV-2 samples at the peak of its epidemic. Information from electronic surveillance databases was used to select cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched test-negative controls from 19 January, 2021 to 25 March, 2021. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness in reducing the odds of primary and secondary outcomes of, respectively, symptomatic and any SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    > Findings
      Among 53,176 HCWs, 46,884 (88%) received at least one dose of CoronaVac and 2,656 (5%) underwent RT-PCR testing from 19 January, 2021 to 25 March, 2021. Of 2,797 RT-PCR tests, 776 (28%) were positive. 393 and 135 case-control pairs with and without, respectively, symptomatic illness were selected for the matched analyses. Vaccination with at least one dose was associated with a 0.50-fold reduction (adjusted vaccine effectiveness, 49.6%; 95% CI, 11.3 - 71.4) in the odds of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the first dose. Estimated vaccine effectiveness of at least one dose against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 35.1% (95% CI, −6.6 - 60.5) in the same time period.

    > Interpretation
      Administration of at least one dose of CoronaVac showed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of epidemic P.1 transmission, underscoring the need to increase vaccination efforts in response to the spread of this variant in Brazil and globally.

    > Summary
      We report preliminary results of an ongoing investigation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH), Minas Gerais, Brazil. We sequenced and characterized 85 nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from randomized samples collected between 28 October 2020 and 15 March 2021. Phylogenetic analysis reveals co-circulation of two variants of concern (VOC), B.1.1.7 (n=3, 3.53%) and P.1 (n=30, 35.29%), and variant of interest (VOI) P.2 (n=41, 48.23%). These variants harbor E484K (P.1 and P.2) and N501Y (P.1 and B.1.1.7) mutations that are associated with increased transmissibility or immune escape. The N501Y mutation has also been associated with an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Notably, we find that between 28 Feb and 15 Mar, 68% of cases were caused by the P.1 lineage in the MRBH. In addition, we report a cluster of two sequences characterized by a unique array of 18 mutations, including new non-synonymous changes in the same critical spike amino acid positions, E484Q and N501T. This lineage seems to have emerged independently from the nationally widespread B.1.1.28, as previously reported for P.1 and P.2, and adds up to the composition of a complex epidemiological scenario of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil.

    > Summary
      The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, first detected in the United Kingdom, has become a global public health concern because of its increased transmissibility. Over 2500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected in the US since December 2020, but the extent of establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic data, we highlight that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York, California, and Florida. Furthermore, we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 establishments starting in early December 2020, followed by interstate spread by the end of the month. Finally, we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in many states by mid to late March. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.

  // Glucocorticoids and B Cell Depleting Agents Substantially Impair Immunogenicity of mRNA Vaccines to SARS-CoV-2
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254656
  ref 'Deepak_et_al_04_07_2021
    head = We conducted a prospective assessment of mRNA-based vaccine immunogenicity in 133 adults with Chronic Inflammatory Diseases (CID) and 53 immunocompetent controls.

    > Background
      Individuals with Chronic Inflammatory Diseases (CID) are frequently treated with immunosuppressive medications that can increase their risk of severe COVID-19. While novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination platforms provide robust protection in immunocompetent individuals, the immunogenicity in CID patients on immunosuppression is not well established. Therefore, determining the potency of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the setting of immunosuppression is essential to risk-stratify CID patients with impaired protection and provide clinical guidance regarding medication management.

    > Methods
      We conducted a prospective assessment of mRNA-based vaccine immunogenicity in 133 adults with CIDs and 53 immunocompetent controls. Blood from participants over 18 years of age was collected before initial immunization and 1-2 weeks after the second immunization. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG+ binding, neutralizing antibody titers, and circulating S-specific plasmablasts were quantified to assess the magnitude and quality of the humoral response following vaccination.

    > Results
      Compared to immunocompetent controls, a three-fold reduction in anti-S IgG titers (P=0.009) and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (p<0.0001) were observed in CID patients. B cell depletion and glucocorticoids exerted the strongest effect with a 36- and 10-fold reduction in humoral responses, respectively (p<0.0001). Janus kinase inhibitors and antimetabolites, including methotrexate, also blunted antibody titers in multivariate regression analysis (P<0.0001, P=0.0023, respectively). Other targeted therapies, such as TNF inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and integrin inhibitors, had only modest impacts on antibody formation and neutralization.

    > Conclusions
      CID patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies exhibit impaired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immunity, with glucocorticoids and B cell depletion therapy more severely impeding optimal responses.

  // Driving potent neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern with a heterotypic boost
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.03.438330
  ref 'Sheward_et_al_04_05_2021
    head = We immunized three rhesus macaques with two doses of soluble prefusion-stabilized Wu-Hu-1 spike protein (2 μg), adjuvanted with 50 μg of saponin-based Matrix-M™ (Novavax AB, Uppsala, Sweden), with a one-month interval between doses, mimicking an immunization schedule for approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

    > Abstract
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) with mutations in key neutralizing antibody epitopes threatens to undermine vaccines developed against the pandemic founder variant (Wu-Hu-1). Widespread vaccine rollout and continued transmission are creating a population that has antibody responses of varying potency to Wu-Hu-1. Against this background, it is critical to assess the outcomes of subsequent booster vaccination with variant antigens. It is not yet known whether such heterotypic vaccine boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin, where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new one, or whether the primed memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs. Here, we show that a single adjuvanted dose of receptor binding domain (RBD) protein from VOC 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) drives an extremely potent neutralizing antibody response capable of cross-neutralizing both Wu-Hu-1 and 501Y.V2 in rhesus macaques previously immunized with Wu-Hu-1 spike protein.

  // A Next-Generation Cleaved, Soluble HIV-1 Env Trimer, BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140, Expresses Multiple Epitopes for Broadly Neutralizing but Not Non-Neutralizing Antibodies
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003618
  ref 'Sanders_et_al_09_13_2013
    head = We describe here the design and properties of a next-generation, fully cleaved and highly stable soluble gp140 trimer based on the BG505 subtype A sequence. We used several techniques, including ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to determine the relationship between the ability of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to bind the soluble trimers and neutralize the corresponding virus.

    > Abstract
      A desirable but as yet unachieved property of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine candidate is the ability to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). One approach to the problem is to create trimeric mimics of the native envelope glycoprotein (Env) spike that expose as many bNAb epitopes as possible, while occluding those for non-neutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs). Here, we describe the design and properties of soluble, cleaved SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers based on the subtype A transmitted/founder strain, BG505. These trimers are highly stable, more so even than the corresponding gp120 monomer, as judged by differential scanning calorimetry. They are also homogenous and closely resemble native virus spikes when visualized by negative stain electron microscopy (EM). We used several techniques, including ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to determine the relationship between the ability of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to bind the soluble trimers and neutralize the corresponding virus. In general, the concordance was excellent, in that virtually all bNAbs against multiple neutralizing epitopes on HIV-1 Env were highly reactive with the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers, including quaternary epitopes (CH01, PG9, PG16 and PGT145). Conversely, non-NAbs to the CD4-binding site, CD4-induced epitopes or gp41ECTO did not react with the trimers, even when their epitopes were present on simpler forms of Env (e.g. gp120 monomers or dissociated gp41 subunits). Three non-neutralizing MAbs to V3 epitopes did, however, react strongly with the trimers but only by ELISA, and not at all by SPR and to only a limited extent by EM. These new soluble trimers are useful for structural studies and are being assessed for their performance as immunogens.

  // Pre-fusion structure of a human coronavirus spike protein

    head = We present the structure of the HKU1 S protein ectodomain determined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 4.0 Å resolution.


    > Abstract
      HKU1 is a human betacoronavirus that causes mild yet prevalent respiratory disease1, and is related to the zoonotic SARS and MERS betacoronaviruses, which have high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Cell tropism and host range is determined in part by the coronavirus spike (S) protein4, which binds cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion. As the largest known class I fusion protein, its size and extensive glycosylation have hindered structural studies of the full ectodomain, thus preventing a molecular understanding of its function and limiting development of effective interventions. Here we present the 4.0 Å resolution structure of the trimeric HKU1 S protein determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. In the pre-fusion conformation, the receptor-binding subunits, S1, rest above the fusion-mediating subunits, S2, preventing their conformational rearrangement. Surprisingly, the S1 C-terminal domains are interdigitated and form extensive quaternary interactions that occlude surfaces known in other coronaviruses to bind protein receptors. These features, along with the location of the two protease sites known to be important for coronavirus entry, provide a structural basis to support a model of membrane fusion mediated by progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage. These studies should also serve as a foundation for the structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens.

Structure-based design yielded stabilized versions of RSV F that maintained antigenic site Ø when exposed to extremes of pH, osmolality, and temperature. Six RSV F crystal structures provided atomic-level data on how introduced cysteine residues and filled hydrophobic cavities improved stability.

  // Virus vaccines: proteins prefer prolines
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.02.002
  ref 'Sanders_et_al_03_10_2021
    head = The stabilization of trimeric class I fusion proteins into their pre-fusion forms has now become a standard vaccine development procedure for which there is a substantial blueprint. We review how this technique emerged during HIV-1 Env vaccine development and its subsequent wider application to other viral vaccines including SARS-CoV-2.


    > Summary
      Most viral vaccines are based on inducing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the virus envelope or spike glycoproteins. Many viral surface proteins exist as trimers that transition from a pre-fusion state when key NAb epitopes are exposed to a post-fusion form in which the potential for virus-cell fusion no longer exists. For optimal vaccine performance, these viral proteins are often engineered to enhance stability and presentation of these NAb epitopes. The method involves the structure-guided introduction of proline residues at key positions that maintain the trimer in the pre-fusion configuration. We review how this technique emerged during HIV-1 Env vaccine development and its subsequent wider application to other viral vaccines including SARS-CoV-2.

    > Objectives
      To evaluate the effect of mRNA SARS-Cov-2 vaccination on the incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in health care workers (HCW).

    > Methods
      The evolution of the incident rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 2590 HCW after a mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as compared to the rate in the community (n=170513). SARS-CoV-2 infections were microbiologically confirmed by an antigen, a CRP positive test, or both.

    > Results
      A total of 1820 HCW (70,3% of total) received the first dose of the vaccine between January 10-16, 2021), and 296 (11,4%) the following week. All of them completed vaccination 3 weeks later. New SARS-COV-2 infections in HCW declined by 62% at 2-4 weeks after the first dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and virtually disappeared after the second dose of the vaccine. Vaccination rate was negligible for this time period in the community (<5%). The decline in the incident rate of SARS-COoV-2 new infection in HCW shortly after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine was strikingly higher than the reduction observed in the general population (p<0.001and became even more pronounced after the second dose of the vaccine (p<0.001).

      mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is associated with a dramatic decline in new SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCW, even before the administration of the second dose of the vaccine.

  // Longitudinal immune profiling of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a solid organ transplant recipient
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.21253992
  ref 'Klein_et_al_03_26_2021
    head = We describe a renal transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection - confirmed by whole virus genome sequencing - 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both initial SARSCoV-2 infection and reinfection.

    > Abstract
      Prior to the emergence of antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants, reinfections were reported infrequently - presumably due to the generation of durable and protective immune responses. However, case reports also suggested that rare, repeated infections may occur as soon as 48 days following initial disease onset. The underlying immunologic deficiencies enabling SARS-CoV-2 reinfections are currently unknown. Here we describe a renal transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection - confirmed by whole virus genome sequencing - 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both primary and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that the patient responded to the primary infection with transient, poor-quality adaptive immune responses. The patients immune system was further compromised by intervening treatment for acute rejection of the renal allograft prior to reinfection. Importantly, we also identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and the formation of humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Further, we found no evidence supporting viral evasion of primary adaptive immune responses, suggesting that susceptibility to reinfection may be determined by host factors rather than pathogen adaptation in this patient. In summary, our study suggests that a low neutralizing antibody presence alone is not sufficient to confer resistance against reinfection. Thus, patients with solid organ transplantation, or patients who are otherwise immunosuppressed, who recover from infection with SARS-CoV-2 may not develop sufficient protective immunity and are at risk of reinfection.

  ref 'Volz_et_al_03_25_2021
    head = We find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing.

    > Abstract
      The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by Public Health England1, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing shows an unprecedentedly rapid expansion of the B.1.1.7 lineage during Autumn 2020, suggesting a selective advantage. We find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Time-varying reproduction numbers for the VOC and cocirculating lineages were estimated using SGTF and genomic data. The best supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage with a 50% to 100% higher reproduction number.

    > Abstract
      Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have raised concerns about resistance to neutralizing antibodies elicited by previous infection or vaccination. We examined whether sera from recovered and naïve donors collected prior to, and following immunizations with existing mRNA vaccines, could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 variants. Pre-vaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351, but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was due to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization. Immunization of naïve donors also elicited cross-neutralizing responses, but at lower titers. Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies.

However, provided RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cell and antibody responses were generated during infection, a single immunization with either mRNA vaccine elicited a robust recall response that boosted the autologous neutralizing titers by approximately 1000-fold and importantly, these antibody responses cross-neutralized the B.1.351 variants, but at lower titers.

  // Assessment of protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 among 4 million PCR-tested individuals in Denmark in 2020: a population-level observational study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00575-4
  ref 'Hansen_et_al_03_17_2021
    head = In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020).

    > Background
      The degree to which infection with SARS-CoV-2 confers protection towards subsequent reinfection is not well described. In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10·6 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2.

    > Methods
      In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 – RR.

    > Findings
      During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2·20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2·11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0·65% [95% CI 0·51–0·82]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3·27% [3·22–3·32]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 [95% CI 0·155–0·246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80·5% (95% CI 75·4–84·5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 [0·179–0·251], estimated protection 78·8% [74·9–82·1]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47·1% (95% CI 24·7–62·8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78·4% [72·1–83·2] vs female 79·1% [73·9–83·3]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3–6 months of follow-up 79·3% [74·4–83·3] vs ≥7 months of follow-up 77·7% [70·9–82·9]).

    > Interpretation
      Our findings could inform decisions on which groups should be vaccinated and advocate for vaccination of previously infected individuals because natural protection, especially among older people, cannot be relied on.

  // N-terminal domain antigenic mapping reveals a site of vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.028
  ref 'McCallum_et_al_03_16_2021
    head = We describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently.

    > Summary
      The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted by most neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite (designated site i) recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P1 lineages, harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity and vaccine design.

  // Impact of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Asymptomatic Infection Among Patients Undergoing Pre-Procedural COVID-19 Molecular Screening
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab229
  ref 'Tande_et_al_03_10_2021
    head = We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, asymptomatic adult patients (n = 39,156) within a large United States healthcare system who underwent 48,333 pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests between December 17, 2020 and February 8, 2021. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

    > Background
      Several vaccines are now clinically available under emergency use authorization in the United States and have demonstrated efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19. The impact of vaccines on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely unknown.

    > Methods
      We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, asymptomatic adult patients (n = 39,156) within a large United States healthcare system who underwent 48,333 pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests between December 17, 2020 and February 8, 2021. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was relative risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among those asymptomatic persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine, as compared to persons who had not received vaccine during the same time period. Relative risk was adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, patient residence relative to the hospital (local vs. non-local), healthcare system regions, and repeated screenings among patients using mixed effects log-binomial regression.

    > Results
      Positive molecular tests in asymptomatic individuals were reported in 42 (1.4%) of 3,006 tests performed on vaccinated patients and 1,436 (3.2%) of 45,327 tests performed on unvaccinated patients (RR=0.44 95% CI: 0.33-0.60; p<.0001). Compared to unvaccinated patients, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower among those >10 days after 1 st dose (RR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.12-0.37; p<.0001) and >0 days after 2 nd dose (RR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.09-0.44; p<.0001) in the adjusted analysis.

    > Conclusions
      COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine showed a significant association with a reduced risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured during pre-procedural molecular screening. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the vaccines on reduction in asymptomatic infections supplementing the randomized trial results on symptomatic patients.

  // Interim results of the safety and immune-efficacy of 1 versus 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 for cancer patients in the context of the UK vaccine priority guidelines
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253131
  ref 'Monin-Aldama_et_al_03_17_2021
    head = This study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not.

    > Background
      The efficacy and safety profile of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been definitively established in immunocompromised patient populations. Patients with a known cancer diagnosis were hitherto excluded from trials of the vaccines currently in clinical use.

    > Methods
      This study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not. Immune efficacy was measured as antibody seroconversion, T cell responses, and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and of a variant of concern (VOC) (B.1.1.7). We also collected safety data for the BNT162b2 vaccine up to 5 weeks following first dose.

    > Findings
      The vaccine was largely well tolerated. However, in contrast to its very high performance in healthy controls (>90% efficacious), immune efficacy of a single inoculum in solid cancer patients was strikingly low (below 40%) and very low in haematological cancer patients (below 15%). Of note, efficacy in solid cancer patients was greatly and rapidly increased by boosting at 21-days (95% within 2 weeks of boost). Too few haematological cancer patients were boosted for clear conclusions to be drawn.

    > Conclusions
      Delayed boosting potentially leaves most solid and haematological cancer patients wholly or partially unprotected, with implications for their own health; their environment and the evolution of VOC strains. Prompt boosting of solid cancer patients quickly overcomes the poor efficacy of the primary inoculum in solid cancer patients.

  // Centenarians and extremely old people living with frailty can elicit durable SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG antibodies with virus neutralization functions following virus infection
  doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252707
  ref 'Foley_et_al_03_08_2021
    head = Extreme aged individuals and centenarians, the majority being female, who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.


    > Background
      The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 114 million COVID-19 cases and >2.5 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis has revealed that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. Despite a disproportionate number of older individuals and long-term care facilities being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, very little is understood about the immune responses and development of humoral immunity in the extremely old person after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we investigated the development of humoral immunity in centenarians following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility.

    > Methods
      Extreme aged individuals and centenarians who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected from positive and bystander individuals 30 and 60 days after original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma was used to quantify IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and subsequent subclasses of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The function of anti-spike was then assessed by virus neutralization assays against the native SARS-CoV-2 virus.

    > Findings
      Fifteen long-term care residents were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals had a Clinical Frailty scale score ≥5 and were of extreme older age or were centenarians. Six women with a median age of 98.8 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were the highest titers observed in our cohort with all IgG positive individuals having virus neutralization ability. Additionally, 5 out of the 6 positive participants had a robust IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. In all 5, antibodies were detected after 60 days from initial diagnosis.

    > Interpretation
      Extreme older frail individuals and centenarians were able to elicit robust IgG and IgA antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The antibodies were able to neutralize the virus. Humoral responses were still detectable after 60 days from initial diagnosis. Together, these data suggest that recovered participants who are of extreme old age would be protected if re-exposed to the same SARS-CoV-2 viral variant. Considering the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to older age groups and long-term care facilities, the humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older age groups is of public health importance and has implications to vaccine responses.

    head = A national record linkage study determined documented COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in unvaccinated household members of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers from 8th December 2020 to 3rd March 2021. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 >= 14 days following the first dose.

    > Background
      The effect of vaccination for COVID-19 on onward transmission is unknown.

    > Methods
      A national record linkage study determined documented COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in unvaccinated household members of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers from 8th December 2020 to 3rd March 2021. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 >= 14 days following the first dose.

    > Results
      The cohort comprised of 194,362 household members (mean age 31.1 years) and 144,525 healthcare workers (mean age 44.4 years). 113,253 (78.3%) of healthcare workers received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and 36,227 (25.1%) received a second dose. Household members of vaccinated healthcare workers had a lower risk of COVID-19 case compared to household members of unvaccinated healthcare worker (rate per 100 person-years 9.40 versus 5.93; HR 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.78). The effect size for COVID-19 hospitalization was similar, with the confidence interval crossing the null (HR 0.77 [0.53-1.10]). The rate per 100 person years was lower in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated healthcare workers for documented (20.13 versus 8.51; HR 0.45 [0.42-0.49]) and hospitalized COVID-19 (0.97 versus 0.14; HR 0.16 [0.09-0.27]). Compared to the period before the first dose, the risk of documented COVID-19 case was lower at >= 14 days after the second dose for household members (HR 0.46 [0.30-0.70]) and healthcare workers (HR 0.08 [0.04-0.17]).

  // COVID-19 vaccine response in pregnant and lactating women: a cohort study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253094
  ref 'Gray_et_al_03_08_2021
    head = We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women. 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers.

    > Background
      Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial COVID-19 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision-making are lacking. We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women.

    > Methods
      131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131), umbilical cord sera (N=10), and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, 2nd vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post 2nd vaccine, and delivery by Luminex, and confirmed by ELISA. Titers were compared to pregnant women 4-12 weeks from native infection (N=37). Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups.

    > Results
      Vaccine-induced immune responses were equivalent in pregnant and lactating vs non-pregnant women. All titers were higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, but not IgA, increased in maternal blood and breastmilk with vaccine boost. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups.

    > Conclusions
      COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placental and breastmilk.

  // Antibody evasion by the Brazilian P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2

    head = In contrast to B.1.351, neutralization of P.1 does not show such a substantial reduction by polyclonal serum induced by natural infection or vaccination and there is no evidence of widespread escape. Despite the reduction in neutralization titres it is hoped that immunization with vaccines designed against parent/ancestral strains will provide protection from P.1.

    > Summary
      Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.

  ref 'Villanueva‐Saz_et_al_03_09_2021
    head = In order to know the impact of the possible transmission chain, blood samples were obtained from 114 stray cats in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) and tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 and other selected pathogens susceptible to immunosuppression including Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) from January to October 2020.

    > Summary
      A new coronavirus known as SARS‐CoV‐2 emerged in Wuhan in 2019, and spread rapidly to the rest of the world causing the pandemic disease named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19). Little information is known about the impact this virus can cause upon domestic and stray animals. The potential impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 has become of great interest in cats due to transmission among domestic cats and the severe phenotypes described recently in a domestic cat. In this context, there is a public health warning that needs to be investigated in relation with the epidemiological role of this virus in stray cats. Consequently, in order to know the impact of the possible transmission chain, blood samples were obtained from 114 stray cats in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) and tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 and other selected pathogens susceptible to immunosuppression including Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) from January to October 2020. Four cats (3.51%), based on enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike antigen, were seroreactive to SARS‐CoV‐2. T. gondii, L. infantum, FeLV and FIV seroprevalence was 12.28%, 16.67%, 4.39% and 19.30%, respectively. Among seropositive cats to SARS‐CoV‐2, three cats were also seropositive to other pathogens including antibodies detected against T. gondii and FIV (n=1); T. gondii (n=1); and FIV (n=1). The subjects giving positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 were captured in urban areas of the city in different months: January 2020 (2/4), February 2020 (1/4) and July 2020 (1/4). This study revealed, for the first time, the exposure of stray cats to SARS‐CoV‐2 in Spain and the existence of concomitant infections with other pathogens including T. gondii and FIV, suggesting that immunosuppressed animals might be especially susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

    head = We report the first cases of infection of domestic cats and dogs by the British B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed at a specialist veterinary hospital in the South-East of England.

    > Abstract
      Domestic pets can contract SARS-CoV-2 infection but, based on the limited information available to date, it is unknown whether the new British B.1.1.7 variant can more easily infect certain animal species or increase the possibility of human-to-animal transmission. In this study, we report the first cases of infection of domestic cats and dogs by the British B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed at a specialist veterinary hospital in the South-East of England. Furthermore, we discovered that many owners and handlers of these pets had developed Covid-19 respiratory symptoms 3-6 weeks before their pets became ill and had also tested PCR positive for Covid-19. Interestingly, all these B.1.1.7 infected pets developed atypical clinical manifestations, including severe cardiac abnormalities secondary to myocarditis and a profound impairment of the general health status of the patient but without any primary respiratory signs. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time the ability for companion animals to be infected by the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 and raise questions regarding its pathogenicity in these animals. Moreover, given the enhanced infectivity and transmissibility of B.1.1.7 variant for humans, these findings also highlights more than ever the risk that companion animals may potentially play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 outbreak dynamics than previously appreciated.

  ref 'Montagutelli_et_al_03_18_2021
    head = We assessed the replication potential in cells and in mice of low-passage clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates of the main lineages.

    > Abstract
      Receptor recognition is a major determinant of viral host range, as well as infectivity and pathogenesis. Emergences have been associated with serendipitous events of adaptation upon encounters with a novel host, and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses has been proposed to explain their frequent host shifts. SARS-CoV-2 extensive circulation in humans has been associated with the emergence of variants, including variants of concern (VOCs) with diverse mutations in the spike and increased transmissibility or immune escape. Here we show that unlike the initial virus, VOCs are able to infect common laboratory mice, replicating to high titers in the lungs. This host range expansion is explained in part by the acquisition of changes at key positions of the receptor binding domain that enable binding to the mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) cellular receptor, although differences between viral lineages suggest that other factors are involved in the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs to infect mice. This abrogation of the species barrier raises the possibility of wild rodent secondary reservoirs and provides new experimental models to study disease pathophysiology and countermeasures.

    > Abstract
      The global spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is devastating health systems and economies worldwide. Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of all variants into human cells is susceptible to blockade by the entry inhibitors soluble ACE2, Camostat, EK-1 and EK-1-C4. In contrast, entry of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, entry of these variants was less efficiently inhibited by plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic.

    > Abstract
      Vaccinations are considered the major tool to curb the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine has demonstrated a 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 disease. These results are now corroborated with statistical analyses of real-world vaccination rollouts, but resolving vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups is challenging. Here, applying a multivariable logistic regression analysis approach to a large patient-level dataset, including SARS-CoV-2 tests, vaccine inoculations and personalized demographics, we model vaccine effectiveness at daily resolution and its interaction with sex, age and comorbidities. Vaccine effectiveness gradually increased post day 12 of inoculation, then plateaued, around 35 days, reaching 91.2% [CI 88.8%-93.1%] for all infections and 99.3% [CI 95.3%-99.9%] for symptomatic infections. Effectiveness was uniform for men and women yet declined mildly but significantly with age and for patients with specific chronic comorbidities, most notably type 2 diabetes. Quantifying real-world vaccine effectiveness, including both biological and behavioral effects, our analysis provides initial measurement of vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups.

Between June 24 and November 9, 2020- participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart.


    > BACKGROUND
      Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa.

    > METHODS
      We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose.

    > RESULTS
      Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.

    > Abstract
      Reports of long-lasting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, the so-called ‘long COVID’, are rising but little is known about prevalence, risk factors or whether it is possible to predict a protracted course early in the disease. We analyzed data from 4,182 incident cases of COVID-19 in which individuals self-reported their symptoms prospectively in the COVID Symptom Study app1. A total of 558 (13.3%) participants reported symptoms lasting ≥28 days, 189 (4.5%) for ≥8 weeks and 95 (2.3%) for ≥12 weeks. Long COVID was characterized by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnea and anosmia and was more likely with increasing age and body mass index and female sex. Experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness was associated with long COVID (odds ratio = 3.53 (2.76–4.50)). A simple model to distinguish between short COVID and long COVID at 7 days (total sample size, n = 2,149) showed an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 76%, with replication in an independent sample of 2,472 individuals who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This model could be used to identify individuals at risk of long COVID for trials of prevention or treatment and to plan education and rehabilitation services.

  // Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n579
  ref 'Challen_et_al_03_10_2021
    head = 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021.

    > Objective
      To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, designated a variant of concern (VOC-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

    > Design Matched cohort study.

      Setting Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection).

    > Participants
      54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay.

    > Main outcome measure
      Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

    > Results
      The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases.

    > Conclusions
      The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.

    head = We analysed a dataset linking 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 COVID-19 deaths in England from 1 September 2020 to 14 February 2021.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, a variant first detected in the UK in September 20201, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity. Here we analyse a dataset linking 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 COVID-19 deaths in England from 1 September 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because of mutations in this lineage preventing PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF1). Based on 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% CI 39–72%) higher after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, care home residence, local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55–69-year-old male increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% CI 0.8–1.0%) within 28 days after a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate a 61% (42–82%) higher hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness.

  ref 'Arnold_et_al_03_14_2021
    head = Patients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated.

    > Abstract
      Introduction Although the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 is well established, there are no published studies on the impact on symptoms in patients with Long Covid. Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals.

    > Methods
      Patients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression.

    > Results
      Forty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache).

      When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.

    > Conclusions
      Receipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing. Individuals with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms should receive vaccinations as suggested by national guidance.

    head = 25 participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years. This study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S. Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5 × 1010 viral particles or 1 × 1011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group).

    > Importance
      Control of the global COVID-19 pandemic will require the development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines.

    > Objective
      To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) in humans, including the kinetics, magnitude, and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years. This study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S.

    > Interventions
      Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5 × 1010 viral particles or 1 × 1011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group).

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Humoral immune responses included binding and neutralizing antibody responses at multiple time points following immunization. Cellular immune responses included immunospot-based and intracellular cytokine staining assays to measure T-cell responses.

    > Results
      Twenty-five participants were randomized (median age, 42; age range, 22-52; 52% women, 44% male, 4% undifferentiated), and all completed the trial through the day 71 interim end point. Binding and neutralizing antibodies emerged rapidly by day 8 after initial immunization in 90% and 25% of vaccine recipients, respectively. By day 57, binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 100% of vaccine recipients after a single immunization. On day 71, the geometric mean titers of spike-specific binding antibodies were 2432 to 5729 and the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies were 242 to 449 in the vaccinated groups. A variety of antibody subclasses, Fc receptor binding properties, and antiviral functions were induced. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced.

    > Conclusion and Relevance
      In this phase 1 study, a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced rapid binding and neutralization antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses. Two phase 3 clinical trials are currently underway to determine the efficacy of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

  // Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.013
  ref 'Garcia-Beltran_et_al_03_12_2021
    head = To understand the impact of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.

    > Summary
      Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.

    > Abstract
      We investigated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in Syrian hamsters. We previously showed protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease and pneumonia in hamsters vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Here, we observed a 9.5-fold reduction of virus neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated hamster sera against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 did not lose weight compared to control animals. In contrast to control animals, the lungs of vaccinated animals did not show any gross lesions. Minimal to no viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and no infectious virus was detected in lungs of vaccinated animals. Histopathological evaluation showed extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 replication in the control animals, but none in the vaccinated animals. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against clinical disease caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 VOCs.

    > Abstract
      Recently, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage called B.1.1.7 (variant of concern: VOC 202012/01), which is reported to spread more efficiently and faster than other strains, emerged in the United Kingdom. This variant has an unusually large number of mutations, with 10 amino acid changes in the spike (S) protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 40 participants who were vaccinated in a previously reported trial with the messenger RNA–based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had slightly reduced but overall largely preserved neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 lineage pseudovirus. These data indicate that the B.1.1.7 lineage will not escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.

    head = We assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant1 now reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the RBM (5 out of 31), but not in RBD neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emergent Variant of Concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more substantial loss of neutralising activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs (19 out of 31) over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone. E484K emergence on a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the vaccine BNT162b.

Other major variants with E484K such as 501Y.V2 and V3 are also spreading regionally. E484K emergence on a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the vaccine BNT162b.

  // Epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dosing regimes
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg8663
  ref 'Saad-Roy_et_al_03_09_2021
    head = Using simple models, we have shown that different regimes may have crucial epidemiological and evolutionary impacts, resulting in a wide range of potential outcomes in the medium term.

    > Abstract
      In the face of vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels to SARS-CoV-2. Two critical issues arise: how will the timing of delivery of the second dose affect both infection dynamics and prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.

It is therefore imperative to determine the strength and duration of clinical protection and transmission-blocking immunity through careful clinical evaluations (including, for instance, randomized control trials of dose intervals and regular testing of viral loads in vaccinated individuals, their contacts, and those who have recovered from natural infections) in order to enforce sound public policies. More broadly, our results underscore the importance of exploring the phylodynamic interaction of pathogen dynamics and evolution, from within host to global scales, for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other important pathogens

    quote !c = In line with intuition, spreading single doses in emergency settings (i.e., rising infections) is beneficial in the short term and reduces prevalence.

    quote !d = On the other hand, if one-dose vaccinal immunity is weak, the outcome could be more pessimistic; specifically, a vaccine strategy with a very long inter-dose period could lead to marginal short-term benefits (a decrease in the short-term burden) at the cost of a higher infection burden in the long term and substantially more potential for viral evolution. These negative longer term effects may be alleviated by the eventual administration of a second dose, even if it is moderately delayed.

    > Abstract
      Continued uncontrolled transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in many parts of the world is creating the conditions for significant virus evolution1,2. Here, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance. This lineage was identified in South Africa after the first epidemic wave in a severely affected metropolitan area, Nelson Mandela Bay, located on the coast of the Eastern Cape Province. This lineage spread rapidly, becoming dominant in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces within weeks. Whilst the full significance of the mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data, showing the rapid expansion and displacement of other lineages in multiple regions, suggest that this lineage is associated with a selection advantage, most plausibly as a result of increased transmissibility or immune escape.

    > Abstract
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are ~95% effective in preventing coronavirus disease 2019. However, the dynamics of antibody secreting plasmablasts (PBs) and germinal centre (GC) B cells induced by these vaccines in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and antigen-experienced humans remains unclear. Here we examined peripheral blood and/or lymph node (LN) antigen-specific B cell responses in 32 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene. Circulating IgG- and IgA-secreting PBs targeting the S protein peaked one week after the second immunization then declined and were undetectable three weeks later. PB responses coincided with maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to a historical strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who produced the most robust serological responses. Fine needle aspirates of draining axillary LNs identified GC B cells that bind S protein in all participants sampled after primary immunization. GC responses increased after boosting and were detectable in two distinct LNs in several participants. Remarkably, high frequencies of S-binding GC B cells and PBs were maintained in draining LNs for up to seven weeks after first immunization, with a substantial fraction of the PB pool class-switched to IgA. GC B cell-derived monoclonal antibodies predominantly targeted the RBD, with fewer clones binding to the N-terminal domain or shared epitopes within the S proteins of human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a robust and persistent GC B cell response that engages pre-existing as well as new B cell clones, which enables generation of high-affinity, broad, and durable humoral immunity.

  #     The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlighted the need to better understand adaptive immune responses to this virus. It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However, that the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have neutralizing activity. We also found a co-dominance of mAbs targeting the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original antigenic-sin like backboost to seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins. Neutralizing activity of NTD mAbs but not RBD mAbs against a clinical viral isolate carrying E484K as well as extensive changes in the NTD was abolished, suggesting that a proportion of vaccine induced RBD binding antibodies may provide substantial protection against viral variants carrying E484K.

In contrast, introduction of E484K reduced the affinity by 4-fold which may explain why virus variants carrying only the E484K mutation have rarely spread efficiently, although viruses carrying E484K have been detected since the fall of 2020 in a handful of patients receiving care at the Mount Sinai Health System and have also been reported in immunocompromised patients.

    > Abstract
      Antibodies elicited in response to infection undergo somatic mutation in germinal centers that can result in higher affinity for the cognate antigen. To determine the effects of somatic mutation on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, we analyzed six independent antibody lineages. As well as increased neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed pathways for acquisition of resistance and, in some cases, restricted the range of neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation apparently imposed a requirement for multiple spike mutations to enable escape. For certain antibody lineages, maturation enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD. These findings suggest that increasing antibody diversity through prolonged or repeated antigen exposure may improve protection against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 populations, and perhaps against other pandemic threat coronaviruses.

      The B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC) is increasing in prevalence across Europe. Accurate estimation of disease severity associated with this VOC is critical for pandemic planning. We found increased risk of death for VOC compared with non-VOC cases in England (HR: 1.67 (95% CI: 1.34 - 2.09; P<.0001). Absolute risk of death by 28-days increased with age and comorbidities.

  ref 'Formica_et_al_03_01_2021
    head = The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late phase studies in younger (18-59 years) and older (60-84 years) participants and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through day 35 (14 days after the second dose). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one or two intramuscular doses of 5-microgram or 25-microgram NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart, approximately 45% were older participants.


    > Background
      NVX CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant.

    > Methods
      The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late phase studies in younger (18-59 years) and older (60-84 years) participants and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through day 35 (14 days after the second dose). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one or two intramuscular doses of 5-microgram or 25-microgram NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7 day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild type virus neutralizing antibody response.

    > Results
      After randomization, approximately 250 participants each were assigned to one of four vaccine groups or placebo. Of these, approximately 45% were older participants. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose, and occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. The two-dose regimen of 5-microgram NVX-CoV2373 induced robust geometric mean titer (GMT) IgG anti-spike protein (65,019 and 28,137 EU/mL) and wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (2201 and 981 titers) responses in younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in convalescent sera for both age groups.

    > Conclusions
      The study confirmed that the two-dose regimen of 5 microgram NVX CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in both younger and older participants. (Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04368988).

    > Abstract
      Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA or adenovirus require a first jab followed by recall immunization. There is no indication as to whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 should be vaccinated, and if so, if they should receive one or two vaccine doses. Here, we tested the antibody response developed after the first dose of the mRNA based vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (BNT162b2) in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of COVID-19 (ExCOVID). Post-vaccine antibodies in ExCOVID individuals increase exponentially within 7-15 days after the first dose compared to naïve subjects (p<0.0001). We developed a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model with l2 regularization to predict the IgG response for SARS-COV-2 vaccine. We found that the antibody response of ExCOVID patients depends on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the symptoms that they developed during the disorder, with anosmia/dysgeusia and gastrointestinal disorders being the most significantly positively correlated in the LR. Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient to induce a good antibody response in ExCOVID subjects. This poses caution for ExCOVID subjects to receive a second jab both because they may have a overreaction of the inflammatory response and also in light of the current vaccine shortage.

    > Abstract
      The Northern Brazilian state of Amazonas is one of the most heavily affected country regions by the COVID-19 epidemic and experienced two exponential growing waves in early and late 2020. Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021 we revealed that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195 which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1 which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November and rapidly replaced the parental lineage in less than two months. Our findings support that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide unique insights to understanding the mechanisms that underlie the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of disseminating SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and potentially worldwide.

    > Abstract
      The advent of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. These data highlight an important gap in our knowledge and may have major implications for how these vaccines should be used to prevent COVID-19.

In contrast, most individuals who are infection-naive generate both weak T-cell responses and low titres of neutralising antibodies, which might not provide sufficient immunity to protect from clinical disease or viral shedding, and might not persist for a 12-week delay until second vaccine is administered.

    head = We here constructed 18 501Y.V2-related pseudoviruses using a VSV-based system, and systematically studied the effects of mutations on virus infectivity and antigenicity.

    > Summary
      The 501Y.V2 variants of SARS-CoV-2 containing multiple mutations in Spike are now dominant in South Africa and are rapidly spreading to other countries. Here, experiments with 18 pseudotyped viruses showed that the 501Y.V2 variants do not confer increased infectivity in multiple cell types except for murine ACE2-overexpressing cells, where a substantial increase in infectivity was observed. Notably, the susceptibility of the 501Y.V2 variants to 12 of 17 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was substantially diminished, and the neutralization ability of the sera from convalescent patients and immunized mice was also reduced for these variants. The neutralization resistance was mainly caused by E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor-binding domain of Spike. The enhanced infectivity in murine ACE2-overexpressing cells suggests the possibility of spillover of the 501Y.V2 variants to mice. Moreover, the neutralization resistance we detected for the 501Y.V2 variants suggests the potential for compromised efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.

  // BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Mass Vaccination Setting
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765
  ref 'Dagan_et_al_02_24_2021
    head = In this study, data from Israel’s largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Each study group included 596,618 persons.

    > Background
      As mass vaccination campaigns against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) commence worldwide, vaccine effectiveness needs to be assessed for a range of outcomes across diverse populations in a noncontrolled setting. In this study, data from Israel’s largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

    > Methods
      All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19–related hospitalization, severe illness, and death. We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan–Meier estimator.

    > Results
      Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions.

    > Conclusions
      This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19–related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.

Thus, this study estimates an average effectiveness of the vaccine over multiple strains. Although we cannot provide a specific effectiveness estimate for the B.1.1.7 variant, the plateau observed during the later periods in the cumulative incidence curve for vaccinated persons suggests that the BNT162b2 vaccine is also effective for this variant, an observation consistent with previous reports that showed preserved neutralizing antibody titers. The B.1.351 variant was estimated to be rare in Israel at the time of data extraction.

  // Evidence For COVID-19 Vaccine Deferred Dose 2 Boost Timing.
  doi: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3760833
  ref 'Epperly_et_al_01_11_2021
    head = This meta study selected vaccines approved under US FDA EUA and evaluated the available vaccine immune response data, infection immune response data, general immunological supporting material, current vaccination plan performance, current COVID-19 infection and mortality data, existing US CDC guidance, and other bioinformatic data to understand and suggest opportunities for improved epidemiologic action.

    >
      Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials used accelerated methods to achieve rapid FDA approval with minimal and wise compromises. While many established vaccines use boost / dose 2 timings that are typically in the 3 to 120 months range , dose 2 timings for both trials were less than 30 days as part of a crucial effort to rapidly develop a vaccine with significant efficacy. Data from both trials showed excellent dose 1 efficacy; however, neither of the related Safety and Efficacy publications highlighted this dose 1 efficacy excellence.

      The trials, manufacturing, and distribution programs have rapidly delivered millions of doses to points of care. However, the ability to administer these doses at localities as rapidly as they can be distributed has been shown as the largest current challenge to achieving the widespread vaccination. Improvements could reduce mortality rates that presently exceed 2000 per day, avoid serious cases at a time where hospital census is at full capacity or beyond, and minimize long-term sequelae.

      This study suggests that it is possible to achieve these and other goals by recognizing the evidence for COVID-19 vaccine deferred boost timing and using a more conventional, decades-tested, boost timing on the order of months. This would enable currently limited US resources to effectively double the population being vaccinated over the next few months, enabling more rapid vaccination of those at highest-risk for severe infections.

This evidence suggests good efficacy of dose 1 for both vaccines and strong likelihood of much greater than 3 month durability of dose 1. It also suggests the use of a 3 to 5 month dose 2 boost schedule to minimize hospitalizations and deaths (on the order of 1000 deaths per day of deferral.)

    / January, 2021 - SSRN
    quote !c = While 95% confidence intervals were not calculated here, they could be calculated using compete study datasets. Table 1 shows that the Pfizer dose 1 efficacy is likely to be near 82% and perhaps as high as 93%. The Moderna vaccine dose 1 efficacy is likely to be between 88% and 94%, keeping in mind the small N of 2 infections in the vaccine arm show a narrow time period where the efficacy calculates to 96% based on the data from “Dose 1 + 14 Days To Dose 2 + 14 Days”

    / January, 2021 - SSRN
    quote !d = In the Pfizer study, there was a minor omission in the study data that presented the dose 1 data in a manner that made it difficult to correctly calculate dose 1 efficacy. Specifically, the table in Figure 3 describing “After dose 1 to before dose 2” cannot be used to properly calculate dose 1 efficacy because it does not allow any time for seroconversion, whereas the data for “>=7 days after dose 2” properly allows for seroconversion. The “dose 1 + 7 days to dose 2” data was omitted. As an aside, this also creates an imbalance in the data presentation such that dose 1 and dose 2 efficacy data in the study is not properly comparable due to this difference in methods

    / January, 2021 - SSRN
    quote !e = In the Moderna study, the chart presents data that enables dose 1 and dose 2 efficacy data to be properly calculated using a 14 day seroconversion screen, but the dose 1 efficacy data is not presented in the article.

    quote !f = In the case of the Pfizer study, some data had to be extracted visually from the Figure 3 chart to arrive at the necessary data. While there is potential for minor error in visually interpreting this data from the chart, that visual chart interpretation error is likely to affect the Pfizer dose 1 efficacy calculation by less than 2 percentage points. The needed data to improve the calculations below surely exist elsewhere in Pfizer documents.

    / January, 2021 - SSRN
    quote !g = Even if dose 1 had only a 60% efficacy, which is clearly lower than a reasonable calculation would determine, it could be argued that doubling the vaccinated population with these dose 1 efficacies would be more holistically efficacious than ensuring a 95% efficacy during a period of vaccinating those at high-risk. This is further bolstered by the vaccine arm of Moderna having found zero serious cases even during the dose 1 only period. The vaccine arm of Pfizer “at least 7 days after Dose 2” had 1 case where an individual was found to have “oxygen saturation … 93% on room air … not hospitalized, did not seek further medical care”.

Given the data available, and evidence from the use of many other vaccines, JCVI advises a maximum interval between the first and second doses of 12 weeks for both vaccines. It can be assumed that protection from the first dose will wane in the medium term, and the second dose will still be required to provide more durable protection.

Based on the timing of cases accrued in the phase 3 study, most of the vaccine failures in the period between doses occurred shortly after vaccination, suggesting that short-term protection from dose 1 is very high from day 10 after vaccination. Using data for those cases observed between day 15 and 21, efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was estimated at 89%.

High protection against hospitalisation was seen from 21 days after dose 1 until 2 weeks after the second dose, suggesting that a single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine will provide high short-term protection against severe disease. Protective immunity from the first dose likely lasts for a duration of 12 weeks.

    / January, 2021 - JVCI
    quote !d = With most vaccines an extended interval between the prime and booster doses leads to a better immune response to the booster dose. There is evidence that a longer interval between the first and second doses promotes a stronger immune response with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

    / January, 2021 - JVCI
    quote !f = Given the high level of protection afforded by the first dose, models suggest that initially vaccinating a greater number of people with a single dose will prevent more deaths and hospitalisations than vaccinating a smaller number of people with 2 doses.

    quote !g = The second dose is still important to provide longer lasting protection and is expected to be as or more effective when delivered at an interval of 12 weeks from the first dose.

    quote !h = The rate of vaccine delivery in the UK is currently limited by vaccine supply rather than by workforce capacity. An extended interval between vaccine doses together with initial prioritisation of the first vaccine dose would increase the flow of vaccine supply in the short term.

    / Feb, 2020 - JCVI
    quote !b = The 52.4% figure, however, includes COID-19 infections occurring shortly after the first dose, an interval within which this dose would not be expected to have had an effect (i.e prior to the recipient mounting an immune response). It would therefore be appropriate to calculate the VE of a single dose in a period after this 10 days. A reasonable interval to use for post first dose VE would therefore be from >14 days to the time of the second dose (scheduled 21 days after the first dose) or to 7 days after the second dose base on the assumption the second dose would not have induced a response in this interval. Unfortunately, this analysis is not presented in the paper.

    / Feb, 2020 - JCVI
    quote !c = This analysis indicates a VE of about 90% from 2 weeks after the first dose and for the following 2 weeks. It does not indicate VE beyond this time point as participants had received a second dose. Assuming the period up to 7 days post the second dose is still dose 1 protection then the VE is at least 74% (bottom end of 95%CI). This estimate of ~ 90% is much higher than the 52.4% reported in the paper where the early cases post the first dose were included.

    / Feb, 2020 - JCVI
    quote !d = ChadOx1 single dose VE: The level of protection gained from a single dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca was assessed in an exploratory analysis that included participants who had received one dose.

    / Feb, 2020 - JCVI
    quote !e = Exploratory analyses for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca showed that increased immunogenicity was associated with a longer dose interval. Efficacy is currently demonstrated with more certainty for dose intervals from 8 to 12 weeks. Data for intervals longer than 12 weeks are limited.

    / Feb, 2020 - JCVI
    quote !f = Moderna: The details below are taken from Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee December 17, 2020 Meeting Briefing Document - FDA. This shows that from 15 days after the first dose to the time of the second dose VE was 92.1% (68.8%-99.1%). Cumulative cases show a divergence between the vaccine and placebo groups from about 14 days after the first dose.

    / Feb, 2020 - JCVI
    quote !g = Additional analyses were done to assess efficacy against COVID-19 after one dose of mRNA1273. In participants in the mITT set who only received one dose of the vaccine at the time of the interim analysis, VE after one dose was 80.2% (95% CI 55.2%, 92.5%). These participants had a median follow-up time of 28 days. The small, non-random sample and short median follow-up time limits the interpretation of these results. There appears to be some protection against COVID-19 disease following one dose; however, these data do not provide sufficient information about longer term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose.

    quote !a = Some argue that any deviation from the protocol used in the clinical trials is unscientific. But the argument is based on an overly narrow definition of science. In both trials, the cases in the placebo and active vaccine groups began to diverge about 10 days after the first dose, with growing vaccine efficacy over time. By the day of the injection of the second dose, the efficacy of the first dose was somewhere in the range of 80 to 90%.

    / February, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !b = Why consider delaying the second vaccine dose? First, with Covid-19 currently killing approximately 3000 people in the United States per day, we face a crucial tradeoff: do we use our limited vaccination capacity to increase the protection of persons who have received a first dose from approximately 85% (after dose one) to 95% (after dose two) by administering a second dose? Or do we use that same capacity to take a similar number of people from an unprotected state to one in which they are 80 to 90% protected? One model shows that the expected number of Covid-19 cases would be significantly lower if more people were given a first dose, even if it came at the cost of deferring the second doses

    / February, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !c = Second, we have recently seen the emergence of several viral variants, with one (B.1.1.7, often referred to as the U.K. variant) that is approximately 50% more infectious than the native coronavirus. This variant rapidly became the dominant strain in much of England, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now predicts the same for the United States in the next 6 weeks. This prospect further increases the imperative to vaccinate the population, particularly people at high risk, more quickly.

    / February, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !d = It is possible that the second dose will be less effective when given later, though few scientists believe this will be the case. Immunity may begin to wane between the first dose and a delayed second dose, although the rarity of recurrent infections probably means that immunity, at least that created by native infection, lasts for much longer than 3 months.

    / February, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    quote !e = Some people may forget to return for their second dose after a longer delay, though a reminder system that works for a return in 3 to 4 weeks should work a month or two later. It is possible that some people will be confused by a change in the vaccine schedule, and the confusion may lead them to eschew vaccination altogether or believe that they need only a single dose.

  // A preliminary report of a randomized controlled phase 2 trial of the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.007
  ref 'Chu_et_al_02_09_2021
    head = This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged ≥18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (≥18-<55 and ≥55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart.

    > Background
      Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

    > Methods
      This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged ≥18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (≥18-<55 and ≥55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response.

    > Results
      Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 µg dose relative to the 50 µg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57.

    > Conclusions
      Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 ug mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

  // Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251054
  ref 'Collier_et_al_02_20_2021
    head = We assessed real world immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2. We did a prospective cohort study of individuals presenting for first dose vaccination.


    > Abstract
      Background Vaccines remain the cornerstone for containing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. mRNA vaccines provide protection in clinical trials using a two-dose approach, separated by a three to four week gap. UK policy in 2021 is to extend the dosing interval from three to twelve weeks. There is a paucity of data in the elderly, even though these individuals are the first to receive vaccines due to risk of severe disease. Here we assessed real world immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2.

    > Methods
      We did a prospective cohort study of individuals presenting for first dose vaccination. Following the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, we measured IFNgamma; T cell responses, as well as binding antibody (IgA, IgG and IgG1-4) responses to Spike and Spike RBD. We also measured neutralising antibody responses to Spike in sera using a lentiviral pseudotyping system. We correlated age with immune responses and compared responses after the first and second doses.

    > Findings
      Median age was 63.5 years amongst 42 participants. Three weeks after the first dose a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved adequate neutralisation titre of >1:20 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 (8/17 versus 19/24, p=0.03). Geometric mean neutralisation titres in this age group after the first dose were lower than in younger individuals (p<0.001). Binding IgA and IgG1 and 3 responses developed post vaccination, as observed in natural infection. T- cell responses were not different in those above or below 80 years. Following the second dose, 50% neutralising antibody titres were above 1:20 in all individuals and there was no longer a difference by age grouping.

    > Interpretation
      A high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2, cautioning against extending the dosing interval in this high risk population.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01179-4
  ref 'Barrett_et_al_12_17_2020
    head = We describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18–55 years (NCT04324606), who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination.

    > Abstract
      More than 190 vaccines are currently in development to prevent infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18–55 years (NCT04324606). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00432-3
  ref 'Voysey_et_al_02_19_2021
    head = We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials—one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)—and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005).


    > Background
      The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the UK regulatory authority, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, with a regimen of two standard doses given with an interval of 4–12 weeks. The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.

    > Methods
      We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials—one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)—and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5 × 1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2·2 × 1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ≥37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005).

    > Findings
      Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24 422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17 178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7% (95% CI 57·4–74·0), with 84 (1·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9%) of 12 282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1%) of 11 962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0% (59·3–85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·59–0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3% [95% CI 60·3–91·2] at ≥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1% [33·0–69·9] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18–55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01–2·68]).

    > Interpretation
      The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

By contrast, high protective efficacy recorded early after a single dose of vaccine in this study, and also seen with other vaccines from different manufacturers, suggests other immunological mechanisms might be at play early after the first dose, because lower levels of neutralising antibody are detected after a single dose. Further study of correlates of protection is ongoing.

Furthermore, the participants who contribute to the analysis of single-dose efficacy are a mixture of participants with events occurring before their booster dose and participants who did not receive a booster dose. These two cohorts differ in some key characteristics; participants who received a booster dose were slightly younger, a greater proportion were men, and a smaller proportion were white compared with those who did not receive a booster dose.

  ref 'Halsey_et_al_12_09_2013
    head = A systematic review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines.

    > Background
      Hypersensitivity disorders following vaccinations are a cause for concern.

    > Objective
      To determine the type and rate by age, gender, and vaccine received for reported hypersensitivity reactions following monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines.

    > Design
      A systematic review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines.

    > Setting/patients
      US Civilian reports following vaccine received from October 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010.

    > Measurements
      Age, gender, vaccines received, diagnoses, clinical signs, and treatment were reviewed by nurses and physicians with expertise in vaccine adverse events. A panel of experts, including seven allergists reviewed complex illnesses and those with conflicting evidence for classification of the event.

    > Results
      Of 1984 reports, 1286 were consistent with immediate hypersensitivity disorders and 698 were attributed to anxiety reactions, syncope, or other illnesses. The female-to-male ratio was ≥4:1 for persons 20-to-59 years of age, but approximately equal for children under 10. One hundred eleven reports met Brighton Collaboration criteria for anaphylaxis; only one-half received epinephrine for initial therapy. The overall rate of reported hypersensitivity reactions was 10.7 per million vaccine doses distributed, with a 2-fold higher rate for live vaccine.

    > Limitations
      Underreporting, especially of mild events, would result in an underestimate of the true rate of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Selective reporting of events in adult females could have resulted in higher rates than reported for males.

    > Conclusions
      Adult females may be at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions after influenza vaccination than men. Although the risk of hypersensitivity reactions following 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines was low, all clinics administering vaccines should be familiar with treatment guidelines for these adverse events, including the use of intramuscular epinephrine early in the course of serious hypersensitivity reactions.

We performed a descriptive analysis, including history of hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis, respiratory allergies, and drug allergies) and vaccines given.

    > Background
      Anaphylaxis, a rare and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, can occur after vaccination.

    > Objective
      We sought to describe reports of anaphylaxis after vaccination made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1990-2016.

    > Methods
      We identified domestic reports of anaphylaxis within VAERS using a combination of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity queries and Preferred Terms. We performed a descriptive analysis, including history of hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis, respiratory allergies, and drug allergies) and vaccines given. We reviewed all serious reports and all nonserious reports with available medical records to determine if they met the Brighton Collaboration case definition for anaphylaxis or received a physician's diagnosis.

    > Results
      During the analytic period, VAERS received 467,960 total reports; 828 met the Brighton Collaboration case definition or received a physician's diagnosis of anaphylaxis: 654 (79%) were classified as serious, and 669 (81%) had medical records available. Of 478 reports in children aged less than 19 years, 65% were male; childhood vaccines were most commonly reported. Of 350 reports in persons aged 19 years or greater, 80% were female, and influenza vaccines were most frequently reported. Overall, 41% of reports described persons with no history of hypersensitivity. We identified 8 deaths, 4 among persons with no history of hypersensitivity.

    > Conclusion
      Anaphylaxis after vaccination is rare in the United States and can occur among persons with no history of hypersensitivity. Most persons recover fully with treatment, but serious complications, including death, can occur.

    > Objectives
      To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity.

    > Exposures
      SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described.

    > Results
      From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64). Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 6 of 188 tested infants (3%), primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. There were no placental pathologic differences by illness severity. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 239 women (95%), and 6 of those women (3%) developed severe or critical illness. Fourteen women (6%) were hospitalized for the indication of COVID-19.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In a large, single-institution cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Neonatal infection may be as high as 3% and may occur predominantly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. Placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity, and hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among nonpregnant women.

    > Purpose
      To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic state on early, first-trimester pregnancies.

    > Methods
      A retrospective cohort study conducted at a university-affiliated fertility center in Montreal, Quebec, since the COVID-19 shut down, March 13 until May 6, 2020. Included: all women who came for a first-trimester viability scan during the study period (Study group) and between March 1, 2019 and May 17, 2019, approximately one year prior (Control). The study population denied symptoms of COVID-19. We reviewed all first trimester scans. Early first-trimester pregnancy outcomes (Viable pregnancy, arrested pregnancy including biochemical pregnancy loss and miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy) were measured as total number and percentage. A multivariate analysis was performed to control for other potentially significant variables, as was a power analysis supporting sample size.

    > Results
      113 women came for a first-trimester viability scan in the study period, and 172 in the control period (5–11 weeks gestational age), mean maternal age 36.5 ± 4.5 and 37.2 ± 5.4 years (p = 0.28). Viable clinical pregnancy rate was not different between the two groups (76.1 vs. 80.2% in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups p = 0.41). No significant difference was seen in the total number of arrested pregnancies (defined as the sum of biochemical, 1st trimester miscarriages, and blighted ova) (22.1 vs. 16.9% p = 0.32), or in each type of miscarriage.

  // Coronavirus disease 2019 and first-trimester spontaneous abortion: a case-control study of 225 pregnant patients
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.10.005
  ref 'Cosma_et_al_2020
    head = We evaluated SARS Cov 2 infection as a risk factor for early pregnancy loss in the first trimester of pregnancy. We conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among pregnant women in their first trimester, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n¼100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n¼125)..


    > Background
      The disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 and classified as a global public health emergency. The evidence related to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pregnancy is limited to the second and third trimester of pregnancy, whereas data on the first trimester are scant. Many viral infections can be harmful to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of them is still unknown.

    > Objective
      With this study, we evaluated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a risk factor for early pregnancy loss in the first trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, coronavirus disease 2019 course in the first trimester was assessed.

    > Study Design
      Between February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among pregnant women in their first trimester, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n¼100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n¼125). Current or past infection was determined by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swab and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies in a blood sample. Patient demographics, coronavirus disease 2019 erelated symptoms, and the main risk factors for abortion were collected.

    > Results
      Of 225 women, 23 (10.2%) had a positive test result for coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 between the cases (11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (P¼.73). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that coronavirus disease 2019 was not an independent predictor of early pregnancy loss (odds ratio, 1.28; confidence interval, 0.53e3.08). Coronavirus disease 2019erelated symptoms in the first trimester were fever, anosmia, ageusia, cough, arthralgia, and diarrhea; no cases of pneumonia or hospital admission owing to coronavirus disease 2019 related symptoms were recorded. No difference in the incidence of symptoms was noted between the 2 groups.

    > Conclusion
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy does not seem to predispose to early pregnancy loss; its cumulative incidence did not differ between women with spontaneous abortion and women with ongoing pregnancy. Coronavirus disease 2019 appears to have a favorable maternal course at the beginning of pregnancy, consistent with what has been observed during the second and third trimesters.

  // Infection and mRNA-1273 vaccine antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 UK variant
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.02.21250799
  ref 'Edara_et_al_02_05_2021
    head = We describe the neutralizing antibody response in 20 acutely infected COVID-19 patients (8-24 days PSO), 20 convalescent COVID-19 individuals (30-90 days PSO), and 14 healthy adult participants that received two injections of the mRNA-1273 vaccine at a dose of 100 µg against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This includes an early from Seattle, WA5 isolate (USA-WA1/2020), a later D614G variant isolated from a residual nasopharyngeal swab collected from a patient in Atlanta, GA in March 2020 (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-EHC-083E/2020), and a B.1.1.7 variant isolated from a residual nasopharyngeal swab collected from a patient in San Diego, CA (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020).


    > Abstract
      Antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein correlate with protection against COVID-19. Serum neutralizing antibodies appear early after symptom onset following SARS-CoV-2 infection and can last for several months. Similarly, the messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, generates serum neutralizing antibodies that are detected through at least day 119. However, the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant has raised significant concerns about the breadth of these neutralizing antibody responses. In this study, we used a live virus neutralization assay to compare the neutralization potency of sera from infected and vaccinated individuals against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. We found that both infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies were effective at neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. These findings support the notion that in the context of the UK variant, vaccine-induced immunity can provide protection against COVID-19. As additional SARS-CoV-2 viral variants continue to emerge, it is crucial to monitor their impact on neutralizing antibody responses following infection and vaccination.

  // Behaviors, movements, and transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory diseases during transcontinental airline flights
  doi: https://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3623
  ref 'Hertzberg_et_al_04_03_2018
    head = On 10 transcontinental US flights, we chronicled behaviors and movements of individuals in the economy cabin on single-aisle aircraft. We simulated transmission during flight based on these data. We also present the results of qPCR panels assaying for 18 common respiratory viruses for 228 samples collected from the air and hard surfaces, and taken before, during, and after the 10 flights.

    > Abstract
      With over 3 billion airline passengers annually, the inflight transmission of infectious diseases is an important global health concern. Over a dozen cases of inflight transmission of serious infections have been documented, and air travel can serve as a conduit for the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and pandemics. Despite sensational media stories and anecdotes, the risks of transmission of respiratory viruses in an airplane cabin are unknown. Movements of passengers and crew may facilitate disease transmission. On 10 transcontinental US flights, we chronicled behaviors and movements of individuals in the economy cabin on single-aisle aircraft. We simulated transmission during flight based on these data. Our results indicate there is low probability of direct transmission to passengers not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger. This data-driven, dynamic network transmission model of droplet-mediated respiratory disease is unique. To measure the true pathogen burden, our team collected 229 environmental samples during the flights. Although eight flights were during Influenza season, all qPCR assays for 18 common respiratory viruses were negative.

  // Aircraft Cabin Air Recirculation and Symptoms of the Common Cold
  doi: https://sci-hub.se/10.1001/jama.288.4.483
  ref 'Zitter_et_al_2002
    head = A natural experiment conducted among 1100 passengers departing the San Francisco Bay area in California and traveling to Denver, Colo, during January through early April 1999, and who completed a questionnaire in the boarding area and a follow-up telephone interview 5 to 7 days later. Forty-seven percent traveled aboard airplanes using 100% fresh air for ventilation, and 53% traveled aboard aircraft that recirculated upto 50% of cabin air.

    > Context
      In recent years, new commercial aircraft have been designed to recirculate approximately 50% of the cabin air to increase fuel efficiency. Some older aircraft use only fresh air. Whether air recirculation increases the transmission of infectious disease is unknown; some studies have demonstrated higher rates of the common cold among persons working in buildings that recirculate air.

    > Objective
      To evaluate the role of air recirculation as a predictor of postflight upper respiratory tract infections (URIs).

    > Design, Setting, and Participants

Forty-seven percent traveled aboard airplanes using 100% fresh air for ventilation, and 53% traveled aboard aircraft that recirculated cabin air.

    > Main Outcome Measure
      Incidence of reporting new URI symptoms within 1 week of the flight.

    > Results
      Passengers on airplanes that did and did not recirculate air had similar rates of postflight respiratory symptoms. The rates of reporting a cold were 19% vs 21% (P = .34); a runny nose and a cold, 10% vs 11%, (P = .70); and an aggregation of 8 URI symptoms, 3% in both groups (P>.99). Results were similar after statistical adjustment for potential confounders.

    > Abstract
      Hundreds of millions of passengers travel on U.S. airliners annually. These large numbers, together with the close proximity required onboard, raise a concern about microbiologic disease transmission in cabin air. Previous air quality surveys generally concentrated on environmental tobacco smoke and particulate matter. They largely ignored the microorganisms also present. We sampled the microbiologic climate of 45 domestic and international flights. We also sampled common locations in a major southwestern city. The concentration of microorganisms in airline cabin air is much lower than in ordinary city locations. We conclude that the small number of microorganisms found in U.S. airliner cabin environments does not contribute to the risk of disease transmission among passengers.

  // Influenza Transmission on Aircraft: A Systematic Literature Review
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0000000000000438
  ref 'Leitmeyer_et_al_2016
    head = We identified 14 peer-reviewed publications describing contact tracing of passengers after possible exposure to influenza virus aboard an aircraft. Contact tracing during the initial phase of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic was described in 11 publications.


    > Background
      Air travel is associated with the spread of influenza through infected passengers and potentially through in-flight transmission. Contact tracing after exposure to influenza is not performed systematically. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the evidence for influenza transmission aboard aircraft.

    > Methods
      Using PubMed and EMBASE databases, we identified and critically appraised identified records to assess the evidence of such transmission to passengers seated in close proximity to the index cases. We also developed a bias assessment tool to evaluate the quality of evidence provided in the retrieved studies.

    > Results
      We identified 14 peer-reviewed publications describing contact tracing of passengers after possible exposure to influenza virus aboard an aircraft. Contact tracing during the initial phase of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic was described in 11 publications. The studies describe the follow-up of 2,165 (51%) of 4,252 traceable passengers. Altogether, 163 secondary cases were identified resulting in an overall secondary attack rate among traced passengers of 7.5%. Of these secondary cases, 68 (42%) were seated within two rows of the index case.

    > Conclusion
      We found an overall moderate quality of evidence for transmission of influenza virus aboard an aircraft. The major limiting factor was the comparability of the studies. A majority of secondary cases was identified at a greater distance than two rows from the index case. A standardized approach for initiating, conducting, and reporting contact tracing could help to increase the evidence base for better assessing influenza transmission aboard aircraft.

    quote !b = The studies were often biased by other potential exposures before or after the flight.

    quote !d = Investigation of influenza transmission is challenging as most influenza infections are asymptomatic, symptoms of influenza-like illness are nonspecific with the majority of respiratory diseases not being influenza, and the short incubation period of 0.7–2.8 days makes timely intervention difficult.

    / September, 2016 - Epidemiology
    quote !e = Although influenza transmission is very common, only a very small number of articles describe contact tracing of influenza cases aboard aircraft; we found only 14 articles in 35 years. This might be due to the fact that contact tracing is not performed during a “normal” influenza season, but is increasingly used early in a pandemic, based on extraordinary objectives. The data extraction was challenging due to missing, incomplete, or unclear description of the investigation. Thus, the conclusions that can be reached regarding transmission aboard aircraft are limited.

    / September, 2016 - Epidemiology
    quote !f = The number of infected passengers on board seemed not to be directly associated with the number of secondary cases. In-flight influenza transmission therefore seems to be rather a multifactorial event including the number of index cases, infectivity, and proximity to the index case as well as other factors not investigated so far, e.g., immune status, age, contaminated surfaces, etc.

    quote !k = The assumption that the risk of transmission increases with the length of flight time due to a higher exposure, as shown for tuberculosis and modeled for influenza, was not corroborated in the studies analyzed here: there were short and long flights with high and low numbers of secondary cases.

Third, physical distance should be maintained before boarding and after disembarking from the aircraft.

    head = This case series assessed a commercial airline flight from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Frankfurt, Germany, that occurred on March 9th, 2020. At the destination airport, we conducted a medical evaluation of the tourist group, including testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a throat swab specimen. In addition, we contacted all passengers 4 to 5 weeks later by phone and conducted structured interviews.

    > Introduction
      This case series assessed a commercial airline flight from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Frankfurt, Germany, that occurred on March 9th, 2020. Among 102 passengers on a Boeing 737-900 aircraft were 24 members of a tourist group. Starting 7 days earlier, the group had contact with a hotel manager who later received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). No member of the group had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 before the flight, and no measures to prevent transmission (eg, wearing of masks) had been applied. The flight duration was 4 hours 40 minutes.

  // Transmission of infectious diseases during commercial air travel
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71089-8
  ref 'Mangili_et_al_03_12_2005
    head = We review knowledge about transmission of infectious diseases associated with commercial air travel, with particular emphasis on transmission within the aircraft passenger cabin.

    > Summary
      Because of the increasing ease and affordability of air travel and mobility of people, airborne, food-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic infectious diseases transmitted during commercial air travel are an important public health issue. Heightened fear of bioterrorism agents has caused health officials to re-examine the potential of these agents to be spread by air travel. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2002 showed how air travel can have an important role in the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and could potentially even start pandemics. In addition to the flight crew, public health officials and health care professionals have an important role in the management of infectious diseases transmitted on airlines and should be familiar with guidelines provided by local and international authorities.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !a = The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk. Transmission of infectious diseases probably happens more frequently than reported for various reasons, including reporting bias and the fact that most diseases have a longer incubation period than air travel.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !b = The risk of disease transmission within the confined space of the aircraft cabin is difficult to determine. Insufficient data prohibits meta-analysis, which would allow an idea of the probability of disease transmission for each respective contagion. Many of the available epidemiological studies are compromised by reporting bias caused by incomplete passenger manifests, thereby complicating risk assessment.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !c = Despite these limitations, data suggest that risk of disease transmission to other symptom-free passengers within the aircraft cabin is associated with sitting within two rows of a contagious passenger for a flight time of more than 8 h. This association is mainly derived from investigations of in-flight transmission of tuberculosis, but is believed to be relevant to other airborne infectious diseases.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !d = Some variation in this association has been reported, with one outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in which passengers seated as far as seven rows from the source passenger were affected.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !e = Transmission becomes widespread within all sections of the passenger cabin when the ventilation system is nonoperational, as shown by an influenza outbreak when passengers were kept aboard a grounded aircraft with an inoperative ventilation system.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !f = Deterministic modelling with data from an in-flight tuberculosis investigation revealed that doubling ventilation rate within the cabin reduced infection risk by half.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !g = Risk also reduced exponentially to almost zero in passengers seated 15 seats from the infectious source.

    # Tuberculosis
    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !h = Several studies about in-flight transmission of tuberculosis have been reported, with most being done in the mid-1990s. Two of the seven investigations revealed a probable link of onboard transmission. In the first occurrence, a flight attendant was the index case, and two documented tuberculin skin test conversions occurred during 5 months in 1992 in 212 fellow crew members and 59 frequent flyer passengers

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !i = The second, and largest, incident was of a passenger with pulmonary tuberculosis travelling from Baltimore to Chicago and then on to Honolulu. Four of 15 fellow passengers seated within two rows of the index passenger had positive tuberculin skin test conversion.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !j = Although there is a risk of tuberculosis within the aircraft cabin, no cases of active disease have been reported as a result of air travel.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !k = Transmission within the aircraft cabin seems to be more likely with close proximity to a contagious passenger (within two rows) over a long time (greater than 8 h) and not as a result of the practice of recirculating 50% of the cabin air.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !l = An overall probability of infection in the order of one in 1000 when a symptomatic source is present has been suggested, and this probability of risk is similar to, if not less than, those in other confined spaces.

    # SARS
    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !m = The global spread by air travellers and in-flight spread of SARS has been documented. The disease is believed to usually be spread by large aerosolised droplets or by direct and indirect contact, but airborne or small droplet transmission better explains the distribution of SARS cases that has occurred on commercial airlines

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !n = A total of 40 flights have been investigated for carrying SARS-infected passengers.31,  32,  46,  47,  48 Five of these flights have been associated with probable on-board transmission of SARS in 37 passengers.31,  32,  46 Most of those passengers were seated within five rows of the index case.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !o = One 3-hour flight carrying 120 passengers travelling from Hong Kong to Beijing on March 15, 2003, began a superspreading event accounting for 22 of the 37 people who contracted SARS after air travel. Laboratory-confirmed SARS coronavirus infection occurred in 16 people, two passengers had a diagnosis of probable SARS, and four were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. The number of secondary cases from that flight remains under investigation, but more than 300 people might have been affected. This pattern could be important because it did not follow the typical example of in-flight transmission of airborne pathogens—ie, risk of disease transmission is associated with a flight time of more than 8 h and sitting within two rows of the index passenger. The duration of the Hong Kong to Beijing flight was 3 h and affected passengers were seated seven rows in front and five rows behind the index passenger.

Possible explanations for this outbreak distribution include: airborne transmission rather than direct contact spread; a malfunctioning cabin filtration system; and passengers infected before or after the flight

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !q = No on-board transmissions have occurred since late March, 2003, when the WHO issued specific guidelines for in-flight containment of SARS.


    # Common cold
    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !r = Common cold outbreaks as a result of air travel have not been reported, which could be attributable to the difficulties of investigating such outbreaks in view of the ubiquitous nature of the common cold. One study compared the risk of developing an upper respiratory tract infection during air travel in passengers flying on aircraft that recirculated 50% cabin air versus aircraft using 100% fresh air in the passenger cabin. Recirculation of aircraft cabin air was not a risk factor for contracting upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.

    # INFLUENZA
    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !s = The fact that influenza outbreaks worldwide have been affected by influenza strains imported by air travel is well established; however, only three studies of in-flight transmission of influenza have been reported. The first was in an outbreak of influenza A/Texas strain aboard a commercial carrier in 1979 that resulted in 72% of all passengers aboard the airline contracting influenza within 72 h.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !t = The second study described an outbreak of influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 at a naval air station in 1989 in military personnel who were returning from temporary duty. Transmission of influenza occurred both on the ground and aboard two DC-9 aircraft that transported the squadron from Puerto Rico to a Florida naval station.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !u = The third outbreak happened in 1999 in mine workers travelling on a 75-seat aircraft.33 15 passengers travelling with the index case developed symptoms within 4 days. Nine of the 15 were seated within two rows, and all were seated within five rows, of the index case. No further influenza outbreaks aboard commercial aircraft have been reported since 1999.

    # Meningococcal disease
    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !v = The third outbreak happened in 1999 in mine workers travelling on a 75-seat aircraft. 15 passengers travelling with the index case developed symptoms within 4 days. Nine of the 15 were seated within two rows, and all were seated within five rows, of the index case. No further influenza outbreaks aboard commercial aircraft have been reported since 1999.The US Centers for Disease Control received 21 reports of suspected air travel-associated meningococcal disease from 1999 to 2001. In all cases the index person was contagious while aboard a commercial flight, but no secondary cases of the disease were reported.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !w = People seated next to an ill passenger should be quickly contacted and given chemoprophylaxis within 24 h of identifying the index case. Chemoprophylaxis given more than 14 days after onset of illness in the index case is probably of little or no value.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !x = From 1996 to 2000 30% of all imported measles cases were estimated to be in people who flew while symptomatic with the disease.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !y = Three case studies have described measles transmission during commercial air travel. A case report in 1982 identified seven secondary cases of measles epidemiologically linked to the index case as a result of in-transit exposure; one was a passenger flying on the same aircraft as the index case and five others were people who had visited at least one common departure gate with the index case.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !z = In the same year, another study reported an index passenger who infected two fellow passengers on a flight from Venezuela to Miami.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !a1 = A third report recorded eight cases of in-flight transmitted measles during a 10-h flight from New York to Tel Aviv in 1994. The source case was not identified but was speculated to be a crew member. In 2004, a passenger with measles travelled from Japan to Hawaii, but this did not result in any transmission to other air travellers.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !b1 = International adoptions have a significant role in the number of imported measles cases. In April, 2004, an outbreak in children adopted from an orphanage in China resulted in temporary suspension of adoptions from that particular orphanage. Nine of the ten confirmed cases were thought to be infectious while travelling. One secondary case was a female student in close contact with an infected child.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !c1 = The most commonly reported diseases transmitted on aircraft have been spread by the fecal-oral route via contaminated food. A total of 41 in-flight food-borne outbreaks resulting in 11 deaths were documented between 1947 and 1999

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !d1 = Salmonella is the most usually reported food-borne pathogen spread via a commercial airline, with fifteen documented outbreaks between 1947 and 1999 infecting nearly 4000 passengers and resulting in seven deaths.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !e1 = Eight food-borne outbreaks caused by Staphylococcus and one associated death were reported between 1947 and 1999.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !f1 = One of the largest cases involved 57% of the passengers served a ham omelette on an international flight in 1975. Surprisingly, only one viral-induced enteritis outbreak has been described. In this incident, contaminated orange juice was the vehicle of transmission and a Norwalk-like agent was isolated from fecal samples of 30 ill passengers.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !g1 = There have been a few reported cases of ill passengers as a result of food or water contaminated with Vibrio cholerae consumed during international air travel. The first documented in-flight outbreak was in 1972 on a flight from London to Sydney via Singapore. 67 Of the 47 people who developed cholera, which was attributed to a cold appetiser served during the flight, one died.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !h1 = The largest outbreak of airline-associated cholera occurred in 1992, during a cholera epidemic in Latin America. During a flight from Buenos Aires via Lima to Los Angeles, 75 passengers developed cholera, resulting in ten passengers being admitted and one death. A cold seafood dish, prepared in one of the cholera-affected countries, was implicated as the source of transmission.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !i1 = No food-borne or water-borne outbreaks have been reported over the past 5 years, which is probably attributable to greater use of prepackaged frozen meals, improved food handling, and inspection, but might represent under-reporting by passengers or reporting bias.

    / March, 2005 - The Lancet
    quote !j1 = Many cases of malaria occurring in and around airports all over the world in people who had not travelled to endemic areas, known as airport malaria, is evidence that malaria-carrying mosquitoes can be imported on aircraft.

  // On the 2-Row Rule for Infectious Disease Transmission on Aircraft
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2016.06.003
  ref 'Hertzberg_et_al_2016
    head = We document reports of in-flight transmission of respiratory infectious diseases by large droplets for which seat plans are given. We summarize these reports and estimate the risks for passengers seated within and outside the 2-row risk zone. we identified 8 reports of respiratory infectious disease transmission on airplanes for which enough information was available to calculate post-flight attack rates inside and outside the 2-row transmission zone. Five reports concerned diseases transmitted by droplets, specifically SARS, influenza, and measles.

    > Background
      With over two billion airline passengers annually, in-flight transmission of infectious diseases is an important global health concern. Many instances of in-flight transmission have been documented, but the relative influence of the many factors (see below) affecting in-flight transmission has not been quantified. Long-standing guidance by public health agencies is that the primary transmission risk associated with air travel for most respiratory infectious diseases is associated with sitting within two rows of an infectious passenger. The effect of proximity may be one of these factors.

    > Objective
      The aim of this study was to determine the risk of infection within and beyond the 2-row rule given by public health guidance.

    > Methods
      We searched the literature for reports of in-flight transmission of infection which included seat maps indicating where the infectious and infected passengers were seated.

    > Findings
      There is a ∼ 6% risk to passengers seated within the 2-rows of infected individual(s) and there is ∼ 2% risk to passengers seated beyond 2-rows from the infectious individual.

    > Discussion
      Contact tracing limited to passengers within 2-rows of the infectious individual(s) could fail to detect other cases of infections. This has important consequences for assessing the spread of infectious diseases.

    > Conclusions
      Infection at a distance from the index case indicates other factors, such as airflow, movement of passenger/crew members, fomites and contacts between passengers in the departure gate before boarding, or after deplaning, are involved.

    quote !d = Contact tracing limited to passengers within 2 rows of the infectious individual may lead to failure to determine other cases, which may have important, potentially dire consequences for spread of infectious diseases. We speculate that infection at a distance from the index case is due to factors such as cabin airflow and movements of passengers and flight attendants. Public health officers investigating suspected disease transmission on an airplane should prioritize passengers seated within 2 rows of the index case for surveillance but should not neglect other passengers for follow-up.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine shortages have led some experts and countries to consider untested dosing regimens. We studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers (HCW) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and compared to them to antibody responses of HCW who were IgG negative to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HCW with prior COVID-19 showed clear secondary antibody responses to vaccination with IgG spike binding titers rapidly increasing by 7 days and peaking by days 10 and 14 post-vaccination. At all time points tested, HCW with prior COVID-19 infection showed statistically significant higher antibody titers of binding and functional antibody compared to HCW without prior COVID-19 infection (p<.0001for each of the time points tested). In times of vaccine shortage, and until correlates of protection are identified, our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a) a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; and b) patients who have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.

    > Abstract
      A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. We report the preclinical development of two BNT162b vaccine candidates, which contain lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived immunogens. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted, trimerised receptor-binding domain (RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation (P2 S). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the P 2S trimers are in the two-RBD ‘down,’ one-RBD ‘up’ state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong TH1 CD4+ and IFNγ+ CD8+ T-cell responses. Prime/boost vaccination of rhesus macaques with BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titres 8.2 to 18.2 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. The vaccine candidates protect macaques from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with BNT162b2 protecting the lower respiratory tract from the presence of viral RNA and with no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase 1 trials in Germany and the United States1–3. BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04380701, NCT04368728).

  // Increased Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 to Antibody Neutralization

    head =  We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD)

    > Abstract
      The Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the globe, and its causative agent, SARS-CoV2, continues to rage. Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Single and combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization1, with more in the pipeline. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-198,9. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however. Recent emergence of new SARSCoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK12 and B.1.351 in South Africa is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple individual mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation, although some mAb combinations retain activity. Moreover, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (~11-33 fold) and vaccinee sera (~6.5-8.6 fold). B.1.351 and emergent variants with similar spike mutations present new challenges for mAb therapy and threaten the protective efficacy of current vaccines.

  // Escape of SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variants from neutralization by convalescent plasma
  doi: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250224v2.full.pdf
  ref 'Cele_et_al_02_27_2021
    head = We compared neutralization of a first wave virus (B.1.1.117) versus the 501Y.V2 variant using plasma collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from two South African infection waves, with the second wave dominated by 501Y.V2 infections.

    > Abstract
      New SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike glycoprotein have arisen independently at multiple locations and may have functional significance. The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as muta6 tions in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001 and 501Y.V2.HVdF002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from six adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001 and 501Y.V2.HVdF002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. We observed that neutralization of the 501Y.V2 variants was strongly attenuated, with IC50 6 to 200-fold higher relative to first wave virus. The degree of attenuation varied between participants and included a knockout of neutralization activity. This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection. It raises a concern of potential reduced protection against re-infection and by vaccines designed to target the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.

  ref 'Wu_et_al_01_25_2021
    head = Using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infection of a global pandemic that has led to more than 2 million deaths worldwide. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated ~94% efficacy in a Phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501YD614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100µg of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at ~1/300. Taken together these data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination.

The attack rate there is an estimate of the final size of the largely unmitigated epidemic that occurred in Manaus.

Correcting for cases without a detectable antibody response and for antibody waning, we estimate a 66% attack rate in June, rising to 76% in October. This is higher than in São Paulo, in southeastern Brazil, where the estimated attack rate in October was 29%. These results confirm that when poorly controlled, COVID-19 can infect a large proportion of the population, causing high mortality.

      SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, caused respiratory disease outbreaks with increased mortality in 4 mink farms in the Netherlands. The most striking postmortem finding was an acute interstitial pneumonia, which was found in nearly all examined mink that died at the peak of the outbreaks. Acute alveolar damage was a consistent histopathological finding in mink that died with pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by detection of viral RNA in throat swabs and by immunohistochemical detection of viral antigen in nasal conchae, trachea, and lung. Clinically, the outbreaks lasted for about 4 weeks but some animals were still polymerase chain reaction–positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs after clinical signs had disappeared.

This was particularly evident in the higher titre samples, which retained an average titre of ID50 680 against the RBD-only mutant.

    > Abstract
      To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines. These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known. Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.

    head = The aim of this study was to examine the mutational effect of spike protein on the sequence through an interaction study of the mutant spike protein and the human ACE2 protein at the structural level.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes an outbreak of COVID-19 disease in humans with the aid of spike protein. It consists of a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The aim of this study was to examine the mutational effect of spike protein on the sequence through an interaction study of the mutant spike protein and the human ACE2 protein at the structural level. A total of 17,227 spike proteins from Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America were compared to the Wuhan spike protein reference sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1). The structural and stability implications of D614G, N501Y, and S477N mutations were evaluated. The binding affinity between mutated RBD and human ACE2 protein was also studied. The D614G mutation may have originated in Germany, Europe based on the date of the first sample collection report. It is now widely circulated all over the world with most occurrences in North America. The mutations N501Y and S477N may have originated from Oceania based on the date of the first sample collection report and also have the highest occurrences in Oceania. Based on the computational analysis of mutational effects, the D614G, N501Y, and S477N mutations decreased stability and were tolerated. For disease propensity prediction, N501Y was more prone to disease compared to D614G, while S477N was not prone to disease. The mutation of D to G at position 614 and S to N at position 477 for secondary structure prediction shows no changes in secondary structure while remaining in the coil region, whereas the mutation of N to Y at position 501 changes from coil structure to extended strand. N501Y mutation has a higher affinity to human ACE2 protein compared to D614G and S477N based on a docking study. D614G spike mutation was identified to exist between the two hosts based on a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 derived between the mink and human. Further research is needed on the link between the mink mutation N501T and the mutation N501Y in humans, which has evolved as a separate variant.

    head = As of 5 November 2020, Denmark had reported 214 human COVID-19 cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 related to mink (all carrying the mutation Y453F in the spike (S) protein, referred to as mink-related variants). The 214 cases represent 4.2% of the 5 102 human samples sequenced in Denmark from week 24 (814 June) to week 42 (1218 October) 2020, when many mink farm outbreaks in the north-west of the country were reported.

    > Summary
      Since April 2020, when the first SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in the Netherlands in a mink and subsequently in a mink farm worker, it has been established that human-to-mink and mink-to-human transmission can occur.
      Since then, infections in mink have been reported in Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United States.
      On 5 November 2020, Denmark reported 214 human COVID-19 cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus variants
      related to mink, as well as infected mink at more than 200 mink farms. Most human and animal cases reported since June 2020 have been in the North Jutland Region. The SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in these cases were part of at  least five closely-related clusters; each cluster was characterised by a specific mink-related variant, identified in humans and animals from infected mink farms. Denmark has implemented robust response measures to control the outbreaks in mink and decrease the spill-over between the human and the animal reservoir.
      One of the clusters (Cluster 5), which was reported as circulating in August and September 2020, is related to a variant with four genetic changes, three substitutions and one deletion, in the spike (S) protein. Since the S protein contains the receptor-binding domain, and is a major target for immune response, such mutations could, in theory, have implications for viral fitness (ability to infect humans and animals), transmissibility, and antigenicity. As a consequence, the evolution of viruses with increasing changes in functional domains of the S protein could affect treatment, certain diagnostic tests and virus antigenicity. It could also have an impact on the effectiveness of developed vaccine candidates, and possibly require them to be updated. Investigations and studies are ongoing to clarify the extent of these possible implications.

However, only three of the strains exhibited a 4-fold reduction when tested with the virus isolate from a patient with the Cluster 5 virus variant, compared to the unmutated common wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain.

There was also a relatively high sequence diversity observed in farms, which still tested negative one week prior to the outbreak, implying that the virus evolves more quickly in the mink population. This can indicate that the virus might replicate more efficiently in mink or that it may have acquired mutations which make it more virulent in mink.

    >
      Neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior infection or vaccination are likely to be key for future protection of individuals and populations against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes.

    head = To define the immune-mediated mutational landscape in S protein, we used a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus and 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor binding domain (RBD) to generate 48 escape mutants.

    > Abstract
      Although neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are a goal of most COVID-19 vaccines and being developed as therapeutics, escape mutations could compromise such countermeasures. To define the immune-mediated mutational landscape in S protein, we used a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus and 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor binding domain (RBD) to generate 48 escape mutants. These variants were mapped onto the RBD structure and evaluated for cross-resistance by convalescent human plasma. Although each mAb had unique resistance profiles, many shared residues within an epitope, as several variants were resistant to multiple mAbs. Remarkably, we identified mutants that escaped neutralization by convalescent human sera, suggesting that some humans induce a narrow repertoire of neutralizing antibodies. By comparing the antibody-mediated mutational landscape in S protein with sequence variation in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, we identified single amino acid substitutions that could attenuate neutralizing immune responses in some humans.

Four variants at this position (E484A, E484D, E484G and E484K) exhibited resistance to each of the human convalescent sera we tested. This suggests that high titer neutralizing antibodies may be directed toward a narrow repertoire of epitopes following natural infection.

    > Abstract
      To investigate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the immune population, we co-incubated authentic virus with a highly neutralizing plasma from a COVID-19 convalescent patient. The plasma fully neutralized the virus for 7 passages, but after 45 days, the deletion of F140 in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) N3 loop led to partial breakthrough. At day 73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new glycan sequon, which generated a variant completely resistant to plasma neutralization. Computational modeling predicts that the deletion and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies. The recent emergence in the United Kingdom and South Africa of natural variants with similar changes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to escape an effective immune response and that vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants should be developed.

    > Summary
      We have detected a new variant circulating in December in Manaus, Amazonas state, north Brazil, where very high attack rates have been estimated previously. The new lineage, named P.1 (descendent of B.1.1.28), contains a unique constellation of lineage defining mutations, including several mutations of known biological importance such as E484K, K417T, and N501Y. Importantly, the P.1 lineage was identified in 42% (13 out of 31) RT-PCR positive samples collected between 15 to 23 December, but it was absent in 26 publicly available genome surveillance samples collected in Manaus between March to November 2020. These findings indicate local transmission and possibly recent increase in the frequency of a new lineage from the Amazon region. The higher diversity and the earlier sampling dates of P.1. in Manaus corroborates the travel info of recently detected cases in Japan, suggesting the direction of travel was Manaus to Japan. The recent emergence of variants with multiple shared mutations in spike raises concern about convergent evolution to a new phenotype, potentially associated with an increase in transmissibility or propensity for re-infection of individuals.

      The SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, which were first detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, are spreading rapidly in the human population. Thus, there is an increased need for genomic and epidemiological surveillance in order to detect the strains and estimate their abundances. Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland. We conclude that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater samples may help detect and monitor the circulation of diverse lineages.

    > Abstract
      While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load – as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal — is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.

      In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A (E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples. This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during the second wave of infections.

      The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD’s receptor binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil. Going forward, these serum escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Those that confer a competitive advantage with respect to viral replication, transmission, or escape from immunity will increase in frequency, and those that reduce viral fitness tend to be culled from the population of circulating viruses. However, mutations can also increase and decrease in frequency due to chance events. For example, a “founder effect” occurs when a limited number of individual viruses establish a new population during transmission. The mutations present in the genomes of these viral ancestors will dominate the population regardless of their effects on viral fitness.

      The UK’s COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world’s largest and unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling. Here we reveal the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country’s first wave of infection. Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses, combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantify the size, spatio-temporal origins and persistence of genetically-distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations in virus importation rates resulted in >1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown tended to be larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown, while lineage elimination was size-dependent. We discuss the implications of our genetic perspective on transmission dynamics for COVID-19 epidemiology and control.

    > Abstract
      The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to ACE2 receptor and is a major determinant of host range and a dominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we experimentally measure how all amino acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein and its affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBD’s surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. But a substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related coronaviruses. However, we find no evidence that these ACE2-affinity-enhancing mutations have been selected in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates. We present an interactive visualization and open analysis pipeline to facilitate use of our dataset for vaccine design and functional annotation of mutations observed during viral surveillance.

      The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 and facilitate viral entry. We utilise coarse-grained normal-mode analyses to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on Glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal-mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations thereon.

    > Abstract
      To investigate potential transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during a domestic flight within Australia, we performed epidemiologic analyses with whole-genome sequencing. Eleven passengers with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom onset within 48 hours of the flight were considered infectious during travel; 9 had recently disembarked from a cruise ship with a retrospectively identified SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The virus strain of those on the cruise and the flight was linked (A2-RP) and had not been previously identified in Australia. For 11 passengers, none of whom had traveled on the cruise ship, PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 illness developed between 48 hours and 14 days after the flight. Eight cases were considered flight associated with the distinct SARS-CoV-2 A2-RP strain; the remaining 3 cases (1 with A2-RP) were possibly flight associated. All 11 passengers had been in the same cabin with symptomatic persons who had culture-positive A2-RP virus strain. This investigation provides evidence of flight-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Discussion with airline representatives indicated that no air handling maintenance issues were logged for this flight and no illnesses were reported among the crew.

      Four persons with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection had traveled on the same flight from Boston, Massachusetts, USA, to Hong Kong, China.

    > Abstract
      Since the first wave of coronavirus disease in March 2020, citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand have been required to undergo managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of October 20, 2020, of 62,698 arrivals, testing of persons in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 86 passengers on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that arrived in New Zealand on September 29, test results were positive for 7 persons in MIQ. These passengers originated from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; 5 had negative predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results. To assess possible points of infection, we analyzed information about their journeys, disease progression, and virus genomic data. All 7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, except for a single mutation in 1 sample. Despite predeparture testing, multiple instances of in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission are likely.

      A novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–CoV-2, has infected >75 000 individuals and spread to >20 countries. It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how it interacts with other microorganisms in the lung.

      We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 8 patients with SARS–CoV-2, and also analyzed data from 25 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 20 healthy controls for comparison.

    > Results
      The median number of intrahost variants was 1–4 in SARS–CoV-2–infected patients, ranged from 0 to 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data. However, very few intrahost variants were observed in the population as polymorphisms, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intrahost variants in a possible person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. Microbiotas in SARS–CoV-2–infected patients were similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.

    > Conclusion
      SARS–CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intrahost variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.

    > Results
      Majority consensus sequences were identical in most of the samples (5/7) and differed in one synonymous mutation from the Wuhan reference sequence. We identified 233 variants; each sample harboured in median 38 different minority variants, and only four were shared by different samples. The frequency of mutation was similar between genes and correlated with the length of the gene (r = 0.93, p = 0.0002). Most of mutations were substitution variations (n = 217, 93.1%) and about 50% had moderate or high impact on gene expression. Viral variants also differed between lower and upper respiratory tract samples collected on the same day, suggesting independent sites of replication of SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak marks the first time that large amounts of genome sequence data have been generated and made publicly available in near real time. Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the virus’s evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at eight different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by 2 February 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 and 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1 × 10−3 subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019.

    head = In this report, we describe long-term SARS-CoV-2 shedding in an immunocompromised individual with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia out to 105 days after the initial positive test.

    > Summary
      Long-term severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding was observed from the upper respiratory tract of a female immunocompromised individual with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was observed up to 70 days, and of genomic and subgenomic RNA up to 105 days, after initial diagnosis. The infection was not cleared after the first treatment with convalescent plasma, suggesting a limited effect on SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of this individual. Several weeks after a second convalescent plasma transfusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was no longer detected. We observed marked within-host genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with continuous turnover of dominant viral variants. However, replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial tissues were not affected. Our data indicate that certain immunocompromised individuals may shed infectious virus longer than previously recognized. Detection of subgenomic RNA is recommended in persistently SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals as a proxy for shedding of infectious virus.

Potential factors contributing to the observed within-host evolution is prolonged infection and the compromised immune status of the host, possibly resulting in a different set of selective pressures compared with an immune-competent host. These differential selective pressures may have allowed a larger genetic diversity with continuous turnover of dominant viral species throughout the course of infection.

  // S-variant SARS-CoV-2 is associated with significantly higher viral loads in samples tested by ThermoFisher TaqPath RT-QPCR
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y

    head = Since more recent information became available regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (S-VoC), which can show a suboptimal profile in RT-QPCR tests such as the ThermoFisher TaqPath used at the majority of Lighthouse laboratories, we analysed recently published data for trends and significance of the S-gene ‘dropout’ variant.

    > Abstract
      Birmingham University Turnkey laboratory is part of the Lighthouse network responsible for testing clinical samples under the UK government ‘Test & Trace’ scheme. Samples are analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples using the Thermofisher TaqPath RT-QPCR test, which is designed to co-amplify sections of three SARS-CoV-2 viral genes.

      Since more recent information became available regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (S-VoC), which can show a suboptimal profile in RT-QPCR tests such as the ThermoFisher TaqPath used at the majority of Lighthouse laboratories, we analysed recently published data for trends and significance of the S-gene ‘dropout’ variant.

      Results showed that:

      the population of S-gene dropout samples had significantly lower median Ct values of ORF and N-gene targets compared to samples where S-gene was detected.

      on a population basis, S-gene dropout samples clustered around very low Ct values for ORF and N targets.

      linked Ct values for individual samples showed that a low Ct for ORF and N were clearly associated with an S-dropout characteristic

      when conservatively inferring relative viral load from Ct values, approximately 35% of S-dropout samples had high viral loads between 10 and 10,000-fold greater than 1 × 106, compared to 10% of S-positive samples.

      This analysis suggests that patients whose samples exhibit the S-dropout profile in the TaqPath test are more likely to have high viral loads at the time of sampling. The relevance of this to epidemiological reports of fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in regions of the UK is discussed.

      The N501Y and K417N mutations in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and their combination arise questions but the data about their mechanism of action at molecular level is limited. Here, we present Free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations for the interactions of the spike S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody derived from COVID-19 patients. Our results shown that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interactions were significantly increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody dramatically decreased; about over 100 times. The K417N mutation had much more pronounced effect and in a combination with N501Y fully abolished the antibody effect. This may explain the observed in UK and South Africa more spread of the virus but also raise an important question about the possible human immune response and the success of already available vaccines.

  ref 'Vöhringer_et_al_2020
    head = A hierarchical Bayesian model is used to jointly model lineage-agnostic spatiotemporal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test data and genomic sequencing data of the B.1.1.7 lineage.

    > Background
      The emerging B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineage has proliferated rapidly in the U.K. Here we use a combination of daily local SARS-CoV-2 incidence data and weekly genomic surveillance data from COG-UK to infer its infection dynamics and parameters during English national lockdown from November 5 to December 2 2020.

    > Methods
      A hierarchical Bayesian model is used to jointly model lineage-agnostic spatiotemporal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test data and genomic sequencing data of the B.1.1.7 lineage. This analysis infers the total and lineage-specific temporal incidence in each local authority and estimates the historic basic reproductive ratio R for new and other SARS-CoV-2 lineages per local authority.

    > Findings
      We find strong and consistent evidence that B.1.1.7 proliferated (R>1) during the English lockdown in 87% (213/244) of lower tier local authorities with an average R value of 1.25. At the same time other lineages contracted (R<1) at an average R value of 0.85 in most regions, leading to 83% (203/244) of regions showing B.1.1.7 proliferation while other lineages diminished.

    > Implications
      The emerging B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineage spreads faster than its predecessors. It continued to grow during a lockdown in which other lineages shrank. These analyses suggest that stricter measures are required to contain the B.1.1.7 lineage.

    # The big "blackout" zones, especially in the East are largely because the Cambridge Lighthouse lab does not use the relevant assay, and that's where most of the pillar 2 tests in that region go. Don't be fooled: from genome data we know the new variant is very common there!
    #
    # The PHE team took ~1800 new variant cases and created a 1:1 cohort of "Covid classique" matched on age, sex, date of + test and location. They then studied hospital admissions and deaths. The two groups had reassuringly similar rates of both.
    #
    # Next analysis is on re-infection, and again no difference: 2 in the new variant group, 3 in the old variant group. Small numbers, but it pretty much rules out hypothesis that the new variant is spreading so fast by re-infecting tons of people who previously had the old variant.
    #
    # Final analysis is "secondary attack rate". When you find a case and trace contacts, how many get infected? 15% for new variant vs 9% for old. There's no p-value on this finding, but my guess is that's a significant difference, and consistent with increased transmissibility.

    head = We analysed humoral immune responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality.

    > Summary
      Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, the exact feature of antibody responses that governs COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. Here, we analysed humoral immune responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-Spike (S) IgG levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. While high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time-dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than live discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed response, measured by anti-S, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, while sera from 89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.

    > Summary
      The teratogenic potential of Zika virus (ZIKV) has made the development of an effective vaccine a global health priority. Here, we generate two gorilla adenovirus-based ZIKV vaccines that encode for pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins (GAd-Zvp) or prM and the ectodomain of E protein (GAd-Eecto). Both vaccines induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and prevent lethality after ZIKV challenge in mice. Protection is antibody dependent, CD8+ T cell independent, and for GAd-Eecto requires the complement component C1q. Immunization of GAd-Zvp induces antibodies against a key neutralizing epitope on domain III of E protein and confers durable protection as evidenced by memory B and long-lived plasma cell responses and challenge studies 9 months later. In two models of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, GAd-Zvp prevents maternal-to-fetal transmission. The gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine platform encoding full-length prM and E genes is a promising candidate for preventing congenital ZIKV syndrome and possibly infection by other flaviviruses.

  // Safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine against Rift Valley fever in pregnant sheep and goats
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y
  ref 'Stedman_et_al_10_18_2019
    head = The safety of the ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine during pregnancy, as well as its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against viral challenge in this physiological state, remained unknown. This study addresses these knowledge gaps by evaluating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 RVF in sheep and goats, the two main livestock species that bear the brunt of abortion and other poor gestational outcomes during RVF outbreaks.

    > Abstract
      Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus that was first discovered in Kenya in 1930 and has since spread to become endemic in much of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Rift Valley fever (RVF) causes recurrent outbreaks of febrile illness associated with high levels of mortality and poor outcomes during pregnancy—including foetal malformations, spontaneous abortion and stillbirths—in livestock, and associated with miscarriage in humans. No vaccines are available for human use and those licensed for veterinary use have potential drawbacks, including residual virulence that may contraindicate their use in pregnancy. To address this gap, we previously developed a simian adenovirus vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 RVF, that encodes RVFV envelope glycoproteins. ChAdOx1 RVF is fully protective against RVF in non-pregnant livestock and is also under development for human use. Here, we now demonstrate that when administered to pregnant sheep and goats, ChAdOx1 RVF is safe, elicits high titre RVFV neutralizing antibody, and provides protection against viraemia and foetal loss, although this protection is not as robust for the goats. In addition, we provide a description of RVFV challenge in pregnant goats and contrast this to the pathology observed in pregnant sheep. Together, our data further support the ongoing development of ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine for use in livestock and humans.

All infected cases (10 cases) were found along two vertical lines of the building, and each line was connected through a single air duct in the bathroom for natural ventilation.

    > Background
      Scientists have strongly implied that aerosols could be the plausible cause of COVID-19 transmission; however, aerosol transmission remains controversial.

    > The study
      We investigated the epidemiological relationship among infected cases on a recent cluster infection of COVID-19 in an apartment building in Seoul, South Korea. All infected cases were found along two vertical lines of the building, and each line was connected through a single air duct in the bathroom for natural ventilation. Our investigation found no other possible contact between the cases than the airborne infection through a single air duct in the bathroom. The virus from the first infected case can be spread to upstairs and downstairs through the air duct by the (reverse) stack effect, explaining the air movement in a vertical shaft.

    > Conclusions
      This study suggests aerosol transmission, especially indoors with insufficient ventilation, which is underappreciated.

  // Assessment of Air Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in Hospital Settings
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33232
  ref 'Birgand_et_al_12_23_2020
    head = This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients.

    > Objective
      To review current evidence on air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings and the factors associated with contamination, including viral load and particle size.

    > Evidence Review
      The MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically queried for original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination in hospital settings between January 1 and October 27, 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 μm, from 1 to 4 μm, and greater than 4 μm.

    > Findings
      Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non–intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (≤1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 103 copies/m3 (0.4 × 103 to 3.1 × 103 copies/m3) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 103 copies/m3 (5.1 × 103 to 14.3 × 103 copies/m3) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 103 to 40 × 103 copies/m3 and 3.8 × 103 to 7.2 × 103 TCID50/m3), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 μm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 μm.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.

    > Abstract
      Human mobility plays a crucial role in determining how fast and where infectious diseases can spread. This study aims to investigate visit to which category of places among grocery, retail, parks, workplaces, residential, and transit stations is more associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in India. A longitudinal analysis of generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a Poisson log-linear model is employed to analyze the daily mobility rate and reported new cases of COVID-19 between March 14 and September 11, 2020. This study finds that mobility to places of grocery (food and vegetable markets, drug stores etc.) and retail (restaurants, cafes, shopping centres etc.) is significantly associated (at p<0.01) with the incidence of COVID-19. In contrast, visits to parks, transit stations and mobility within residential neighbourhoods are not statistically significant (p>0.05) in changing COVID-19 cases over time. These findings highlight that instead of blanket lockdown restrictions, authorities should adopt a place-based approach focusing on vulnerable hotspot locations to contain the COVID-19 and any future infectious disease.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2018.12.003
  ref 'Stone_et_al_12_14_2018
    head = Two cases with a past history of immediate hypersensitivity to PEG-containing medications were used to study potential mechanisms and cross-reactivity of immediate reactions to PEG 3350. We searched US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reports for immediate reactions to PEG 3350 to determine the potential scope of this problem in the United States.

    > Background
      The most common immediate hypersensitivity to macrogols is associated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350; however, the epidemiology, mechanisms, and cross-reactivity are poorly understood. Thousands of medications contain either PEGs or structurally similar polysorbates.

    > Objective
      Our objective was to better understand the mechanism, cross-reactivity, and scope of PEG hypersensitivity.

    > Methods
      Two cases with a past history of immediate hypersensitivity to PEG-containing medications were used to study potential mechanisms and cross-reactivity of immediate reactions to PEG 3350. Skin testing and oral challenges with PEG and polysorbate-containing agents were employed to determine clinical reactivity and cross-reactivity between the 2 allergens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and electrochemiluminescent immunoassay were used to detect anti-PEG specific IgG and IgE, respectively, using PEGylated protein or PEG alone as antigens in 2 cases and 6 PEG 3350 tolerant controls. We searched US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reports for immediate reactions to PEG 3350 to determine the potential scope of this problem in the United States.

    > Results
      Skin and provocation testing demonstrated symptomatic reactivity in both cases to PEG 3350 and polysorbate 80. Plasma samples were positive for anti-PEG specific IgE and IgG antibodies only in cases and binding increased directly proportional to the molecular weight of PEG tested. FDA adverse event reports revealed 53 additional cases of possible PEG 3350 anaphylaxis.

    > Conclusions
      Immediate hypersensitivity to PEG 3350 with cross-reactive polysorbate 80 hypersensitivity may be underrecognized in clinical practice and can be detected with clinical skin testing. Our studies raise the possibility of an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity mechanism in some cases.

    > Abstract
      A vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is needed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Structural studies have led to the development of mutations that stabilize Betacoronavirus spike proteins in the prefusion state, improving their expression and increasing immunogenicity1. This principle has been applied to design mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Here we show that mRNA-1273 induces potent neutralizing antibody responses to both wild-type (D614) and D614G mutant2 SARS-CoV-2 as well as CD8+ T cell responses, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs and noses of mice without evidence of immunopathology. mRNA-1273 is currently in a phase III trial to evaluate its efficacy.

  // Diagnostic accuracy of Loop mediated isothermal amplification coupled to Nanopore sequencing (LamPORE) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection at scale in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations

    head = We carried out a very large asymptomatic cohort study of health care workers using a novel technology, LamPORE, comparing it to a reference CE-IVD marked RT-qPCR assay. In addition, we have also carried out a large symptomatic cohort study based on “real world” samples typically found in clinical practice.

    > Introduction
      Rapid, high throughput diagnostics are a valuable tool, allowing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in populations, in order to identify and isolate people with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Reagent shortages and restricted access to high throughput testing solutions have limited the effectiveness of conventional assays such as reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly throughout the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the use of LamPORE, where loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is coupled to nanopore sequencing technology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.

    > Methods
      In an asymptomatic prospective cohort, for three weeks in September 2020 health care workers across four sites (Birmingham, Southampton, Basingstoke and Manchester) self-swabbed with nasopharyngeal swabs weekly and supplied a saliva specimen daily. These samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Oxford Nanopore LamPORE system and a reference RT-qPCR assay on extracted sample RNA. A second retrospective cohort of 848 patients with influenza like illness from March 2020 – June 2020, were similarly tested from nasopharyngeal swabs.

    > Results
      In the asymptomatic cohort a total of 1200 participants supplied 23,427 samples (3,966 swab, 19,461 saliva) over a three-week period. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection using LamPORE was 0.95%. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of LamPORE was >99.5% in both swab and saliva asymptomatic samples when compared to the reference RT-qPCR test.

    > Conclusions
      LamPORE is a highly accurate methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic population settings and can be used as an alternative to RT-qPCR.

    > Abstract
      Continued uncontrolled transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in many parts of the world is creating the conditions for significant virus evolution. Here, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance. This lineage emerged in South Africa after the first epidemic wave in a severely affected metropolitan area, Nelson Mandela Bay, located on the coast of the Eastern Cape Province. This lineage spread rapidly, becoming within weeks the dominant lineage in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape Provinces. Whilst the full significance of the mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data, showing the rapid displacement of other lineages, suggest that this lineage may be associated with increased transmissibility.

    > Abstract
      Zoonotic pandemics follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. Often, pandemics wane, becoming endemic pathogens. Sustained circulation requires evasion of protective immunity elicited by previous infections. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a global pandemic. Since coronaviruses have a lower substitution rate than other RNA viruses this gave hope that spike glycoprotein is an antigenically stable vaccine target. However, we describe an evolutionary pattern of recurrent deletions at four antigenic sites in the spike glycoprotein. Deletions abolish binding of a reported neutralizing antibody. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are continually exploring genetic and antigenic space via deletion in individual patients and at global scales. In viruses where substitutions are relatively infrequent, deletions represent a mechanism to drive rapid evolution, potentially promoting antigenic drift.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 Spike amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. Of particular note this deletion, ΔH69/V70, often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F. One of the ΔH69/V70+ N501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, is comprised of over 1400 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the UK and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (ΔH69/V70 and Δ144/145) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). Some of these mutations have possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7. We find the ΔH69/V70 enhances viral infectivity, indicating its effect on virus fitness is independent to the N501Y RBM change. Enhanced surveillance for the ΔH69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a priority. Such “permissive” mutations have the potential to enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to generate vaccine escape variants that would have otherwise significantly reduced viral fitness.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is critical for virus infection via engagement of ACE2, and amino acid variation in Spike is increasingly appreciated. Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. Here we report fatal SARS-CoV-2 escape from neutralising antibodies in an immune suppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, generating whole genome ultradeep sequences by both short and long read technologies over 23 time points spanning 101 days. Little evolutionary change was observed in the viral population over the first 65 days despite two courses of remdesivir. However, following convalescent plasma we observed dynamic virus population shifts, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain bearing D796H in S2 and ΔH69/ΔV70 in the S1 NTD of the Spike protein. As serum neutralisation waned, viruses with the escape genotype diminished in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma. In vitro, the Spike escape variant conferred decreased sensitivity to multiple units of convalescent plasma/sera from different recovered patients, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. These data reveal strong positive selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy and identify the combination of Spike mutations D796H and ΔH69/ΔV70 as a broad antibody resistance mechanism against commonly occurring antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.

      The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prioritized the development of small-animal models for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We adapted a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging in the respiratory tract of aged BALB/c mice. The resulting mouse-adapted strain at passage 6 (called MASCp6) showed increased infectivity in mouse lung and led to interstitial pneumonia and inflammatory responses in both young and aged mice after intranasal inoculation. Deep sequencing revealed a panel of adaptive mutations potentially associated with the increased virulence. In particular, the N501Y mutation is located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The protective efficacy of a recombinant RBD vaccine candidate was validated by using this model. Thus, this mouse-adapted strain and associated challenge model should be of value in evaluating vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

      B.1.1.7 has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein.
      Three of these mutations have potential biological effects that have been described previously to varying extents:

      Mutation N501Y is one of six key contact residues within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and has been identified as increasing binding affinity to human and murine ACE2.
      The spike deletion 69-70del has been described in the context of evasion to the human immune response but has also occurred a number of times in association with other RBD changes.
      Mutation P681H is immediately adjacent to the furin cleavage site, a known location of biological significance.

      The rapid growth of this lineage indicates the need for enhanced genomic and epidemiological surveillance worldwide and laboratory investigations of antigenicity and infectivity.

  // Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.31756
  ref 'Madwell_et_al_12_14_2020
    head = In this meta-analysis of 54 studies with 77 758 participants, the estimated overall household secondary attack rate was 16.6%, higher than observed secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

    > Importance
      Crowded indoor environments, such as households, are high-risk settings for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

    > Objectives
      To examine evidence for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by several covariates, and to compare it with other coronaviruses.

    > Data Source
      PubMed, searched through October 19, 2020. Search terms included SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission.

    > Study Selection
      All articles with original data for estimating household secondary attack rate were included. Case reports focusing on individual households and studies of close contacts that did not report secondary attack rates for household members were excluded.

    > Data Extraction and Synthesis
      Meta-analyses were done using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model to yield a point estimate and 95% CI for secondary attack rate for each subgroup analyzed, with a random effect for each study. To make comparisons across exposure types, study was treated as a random effect, and exposure type was a fixed moderator. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by covariates (ie, household or family contact, index case symptom status, adult or child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, adult or child index cases, index case sex, number of contacts in household) and for other coronaviruses.

    > Results
      A total of 54 relevant studies with 77 758 participants reporting household secondary transmission were identified. Estimated household secondary attack rate was 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher than secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) and MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%). Household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) than from asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%), to adult contacts (28.3%; 95% CI, 20.2%-37.1%) than to child contacts (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.3%-21.7%), to spouses (37.8%; 95% CI, 25.8%-50.5%) than to other family contacts (17.8%; 95% CI, 11.7%-24.8%), and in households with 1 contact (41.5%; 95% CI, 31.7%-51.7%) than in households with 3 or more contacts (22.8%; 95% CI, 13.6%-33.5%).

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      The findings of this study suggest that given that individuals with suspected or confirmed infections are being referred to isolate at home, households will continue to be a significant venue for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

  // ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine prevents SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y
  ref 'Doremalen_et_al_07_30_2020
    head = We show that a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is effective in preventing damage to the lungs after challenging non-human primates (NHPs) with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 to both upper and lower respiratory tract, and a prime–boost regimen significantly increased humoral immune responses.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 20191,2 and is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Vaccines are an essential countermeasure and are urgently needed to control the pandemic. Here we show that the adenovirus-vector-based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice and elicites a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was predominantly mediated by type-1 T helper cells, as demonstrated by the profiling of the IgG subclass and the expression of cytokines. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (using either a prime-only or a prime–boost regimen) induced a balanced humoral and cellular immune response of type-1 and type-2 T helper cells in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. However, there was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. Notably, we found no evidence of immune-enhanced disease after viral challenge in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy profiles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomized controlled clinical trials in humans.

Here we report long-term follow-up data.


    > Background
      The HVTN 503/Phambili study, which assessed the efficacy of the Merck Ad5 gag/pol/nef subtype B HIV-1 preventive vaccine in South Africa, was stopped when futility criteria in the Step study (assessing the same vaccine in the Americas, Caribbean, and Australia) were met. Here we report long-term follow-up data.

    > Methods
      HVTN 503/Phambili was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial that recruited HIV-1 uninfected, sexually active adults aged 18–35 years from five sites in South Africa. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated random numbers to either vaccine or placebo, stratified by site and sex. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HIV-1 infection in the modified intention-to-treat cohort, all of whom were unmasked early in follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00413725 and the South African National Health Research Database, number DOH-27-0207-1539.

    > Findings
      Between Jan 24, 2007, and Sept 19, 2007, 801 participants (26·7%) of a planned 3000 were randomly assigned (400 to vaccine, 401 to placebo); 216 (27%) received only one injection, 529 (66%) received only two injections, and 56 (7%) received three injections. At a median follow-up of 42 months (IQR 31–42), 63 vaccine recipients (16%) had HIV-1 infection compared with 37 placebo recipients (9%; adjusted HR 1·70, 95% CI 1·13–2·55; p=0·01). Risk for HIV-1 infection did not differ according to the number of vaccinations received, sex, circumcision, or adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) serostatus. Differences in risk behaviour at baseline or during the study, or annualised dropout rate (7·7% [95% CI 6·2–9·5] for vaccine recipients vs 8·8% [7·1–10·7] for placebo recipients; p=0·40) are unlikely explanations for the increased rate of HIV-1 infections seen in vaccine recipients.

    > Interpretation
      The increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in vaccine recipients, irrespective of number of doses received, warrants further investigation to understand the biological mechanism. We caution against further use of the Ad5 vector for HIV vaccines.

  // Safety and Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccine in Older Adults
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2028436
  ref 'Anderson_et_al_09_29_2020
    head = We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years).

    > Background
      Testing of vaccine candidates to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an older population is important, since increased incidences of illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been associated with an older age.

    > Methods
      We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 μg or 100 μg of vaccine administered 28 days apart.

    > Results
      Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-μg dose, the anti–S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-μg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells.

    > Conclusions
      In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-μg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-μg dose, which supports the use of the 100-μg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

However, we observed an increase in neutralizing activity on the pseudovirus neutralization assay when 614G was substituted for 614D. These data are consistent with results in mice that were vaccinated with mRNA-127316 and with observations from convalescent donor serum. These data are reassuring that immune responses to mRNA-1273 may not be compromised by the presence of the 614G strain.

In the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked, with seroconversion rates at 96% and 97%, respectively, at day 28.

    > Background
      This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study.

    > Methods
      This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 × 1011 viral particles per mL or 5 × 1010 viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389.

    >  Findings
      603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles n=253; 5 × 1010 viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2–749·2) and 571·0 (467·6–697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93–98) and 97% (92–99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 16·8–22·7) and 18·3 (14·4–23·3) in participants receiving 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85–93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81–92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 × 1011 viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5 × 1010 viral particles dose group. No serious adverse reactions were documented.

    > Background
      The 2013–15 Ebola virus disease epidemic in west Africa greatly accelerated the development of Ebola vaccine. We aimed to analyse the immune persistence induced by one shot of an adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola virus vaccine up to 6 months and the effect of boosting with a homologous vector in healthy adults in China.

    > Methods
      In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 clinical trial in one site in Jiangsu Province, China, 120 healthy adults aged 18–60 years received an initial dose of intramuscular adenovirus type-5 Ebola virus vaccine of 4·0 × 1010 viral particles, 1·6 × 1011 viral particles, or placebo, and were followed up to day 168. Participants were subsequently re-recruited to receive a booster dose of the same vaccine or placebo, in the same dose, at month 6. Women who were pregnant, breastfeeding, or planned to become pregnant during the next month were excluded. Randomisation was conducted by computer-generated block randomisation. Randomisation data were unmasked for interim analysis of the data obtained between days 0–28 but not disclosed to participants or site staff. Safety and immunogenicity analysis were done on the intention-to-treat population. We aimed to assess the safety profile of the experimental vaccine and the immunity responses to a single-dose immunisation or a homologous prime-boost regimen. Primary outcomes were Ebola glycoprotein-specific ELISA antibody responses 28 days post-boost and the occurrences of adverse reactions post-boost. The original trial and the extended booster study were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02326194 and NCT02533791, respectively.

    > Findings
      Between Dec 28, 2014, and Jan 9, 2015, we enrolled 210 volunteers. 90 participants were not randomised due to not meeting inclusion criteria (61), meeting exclusion criteria (4), or withdrawal of consent (25). 120 people were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular Ebola vaccine at 4·0 × 1010 viral particles (low dose, n=40), Ebola vaccine at 1·6 × 1011 viral particles (high dose, n=40), or placebo (n=40, in two groups of 20). After prime vaccination, the geometric mean titer (GMT) of ELISA EC90 peaked at 682·7 (95% CI 424·3–1098·5) in the low-dose vaccine group and 1305·7 (970·1–1757·2) in the high-dose vaccine group at day 28, and then fell gradually through the next a few months to 575·5 (394·8–838·8) in the high-dose vaccine group and 197·9 (107·9–362·7) in the low-dose vaccine group at day 168. No specific response was recorded in the placebo group with a GMT of 5·0. Of the 120 participants involved in the initial trial, ten participants declined to participate, and 110 were included in the boost immunisation: 38 received the low dose, 35 received the high dose, and 37 received the placebo. At day 28 after boost vaccination, the ELISA EC90 titres rapidly rose to 6110 (95% CI 4705–7935) in the low-dose group and to 11825 (8904–15705) in the high dose group. 78 of 110 participants reported at least one solicited adverse reaction within the first 7 days after booster administration. Both of the groups who received vaccine showed significantly higher incidence of mild or moderate solicited adverse reactions than did the placebo group.

    > Interpretation
      The adenovirus 5-vectored Ebola vaccine of 1·6 × 1011 viral particles was highly immunogenic and safe. The lower dose of 4·0 × 1010 viral particles was also safe, but immunogenicity seemed to be more vulnerable to the pre-existing immunity of adenovirus 5. A homologous priming-boosting regimen with adenovirus type-5 Ebola vaccine at 6 months interval was able to elicit greater antibody responses with longer duration. These results support an immunisation strategy to implement a booster injection for a more durable protection against Ebola virus disease.

    > Abstract
      The consequences of the 2013–16 Ebola Zaire virus disease epidemic in West Africa were grave. The economies, healthcare systems and communities of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia were devastated by over 18 months of active Ebola virus transmission, followed by sporadic resurgences potentially related to sexual transmission by survivors with viral persistence in body fluids following recovery. The need to develop and implement strategies to prevent and mitigate future outbreaks is now beyond dispute. The potential for unpredictable outbreaks of indeterminate duration, and control challenges posed by the possibility of sporadic re-emergence, mean that implementation of an effective vaccination program for outbreak containment necessitates a vaccine providing durable immunity. Heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens deliver the same or similar antigens through different vaccine types, the first to prime and the second to boost the immune system. Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo is an investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine regimen that uses this heterologous prime-boost approach. Preliminary Phase 1 data suggest that Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo confers durable immunity for at least 240 d and is well-tolerated with a good safety profile. This regimen may therefore be suitable for prophylactic use in a regional or targeted population vaccination strategy, and could potentially aid prevention and control of future Ebola outbreaks.

    > Abstract
      Ebola hemorrhagic fever, also known as Ebola virus disease or EVD, is one of the most dangerous viral diseases in humans and animals. In this open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial, we assessed the safety, side effects, and immunogenicity of a novel, heterologous prime-boost vaccine against Ebola, which was administered in 2 doses to 84 healthy adults of both sexes between 18 and 55 years. The vaccine consists of live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and adenovirus serotype-5 (Ad5) expressing Ebola envelope glycoprotein. The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site, although no serious adverse events were reported. The vaccine did not significantly impact blood, urine, and immune indices. Seroconversion rate was 100 %. Antigen-specific IgG geometric mean titer at day 42 was 3,277 (95 % confidence interval 2,401–4,473) in volunteers immunized at full dose. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 93.1 % of volunteers immunized at full dose, with geometric mean titer 20. Antigen-specific response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also detected in 100 % of participants, as well as in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 82.8 % and 58.6 % of participants vaccinated at full dose, respectively. The data indicate that the vaccine is safe and induces strong humoral and cellular immune response in up to 100 % of healthy adult volunteers, and provide a rationale for testing efficacy in Phase III trials. Indeed, the strong immune response to the vaccine may elicit long-term protection. This trial was registered with grls.rosminzdrav.ru (No. 495*), and with zakupki.gov.ru (No. 0373100043215000055).

    > Background
      The 2014 West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease highlighted the urgent need to develop an effective Ebola vaccine.

    > Methods
      We undertook 2 phase 1 studies assessing safety and immunogenicity of the viral vector modified vaccinia Ankara virus vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine (MVA-EBO-Z), manufactured rapidly on a new duck cell line either alone or in a heterologous prime-boost regimen with recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) followed by MVA-EBO-Z. Adult volunteers in the United Kingdom (n = 38) and Senegal (n = 40) were vaccinated and an accelerated 1-week prime-boost regimen was assessed in Senegal. Safety was assessed by active and passive collection of local and systemic adverse events.

    > Results
      The standard and accelerated heterologous prime-boost regimens were well-tolerated and elicited potent cellular and humoral immunogenicity in the United Kingdom and Senegal, but vaccine-induced antibody responses were significantly lower in Senegal. Cellular immune responses measured by flow cytometry were significantly greater in African vaccinees receiving ChAd3 and MVA vaccines in the same rather than the contralateral limb.

    head = In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1 or BNT162b2.

    > Background
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of persons worldwide. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States.

    > Methods
      In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 μg of BNT162b1), participants received one dose.

    > Results
      A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples.

    > Conclusions
      The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2–3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

    > Introduction
      Given the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and much of the U.S. implementing social distancing owing to the lack of alternatives, there has been a push to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing.

    > Methods
      In 2020, the team developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination.

    > Results
      Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the peak by >99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when vaccination coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5–3.5). This vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to 80% when coverage drops to 60% when reproduction number is 2.5, rising to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when the reproduction number is 3.5. To extinguish an ongoing epidemic, the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when coverage is 100% and at least 80% when coverage drops to 75% to reduce the peak by 85%–86%, 61%–62%, and 32% when vaccination occurs after 5%, 15%, and 30% of the population, respectively, have already been exposed to COVID-19 coronavirus. A vaccine with an efficacy between 60% and 80% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages.

    > Conclusions
      This study found that the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80% to largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing).

    head = MenC vaccination programmes with two MenC infant priming doses could be reduced to a single priming dose without reducing post-boost antibody titres.

    > Objective
      To determine whether the immunogenicity of a single dose infant priming schedule of serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) conjugate vaccine is non-inferior to a two dose priming schedule when followed by a booster dose at age 12 months.

    > Design
      Phase IV open label randomised controlled trial carried out from July 2010 until August 2013

    > Setting
      Four centres in the United Kingdom and one centre in Malta.

    > Participants
      Healthy infants aged 6-12 weeks followed up until age 24 months.

    > Interventions
      In the priming phase of the trial 509 infants were randomised in a 10:10:7:4 ratio into four groups to receive either a single MenC-cross reacting material 197 (CRM) dose at 3 months; two doses of MenC-CRM at 3 and 4 months; a single MenC-polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid (TT) dose at 3 months; or no MenC doses, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)-MenC-TT vaccine was administered to all infants at 12 months of age. All infants also received the nationally routinely recommended vaccines. Blood samples were taken at age 5, 12, 13, and 24 months.

    > Main outcome measure
      MenC serum bactericidal antibody assay with rabbit complement (rSBA) one month after the Hib-MenC-TT vaccine. Non-inferiority was met if the lower 95% confidence limit of the difference in the mean log10 MenC rSBA between the single dose MenC-CRM and the two dose MenC-CRM groups was >−0.35.

    > Results
      The primary objective was met: after a Hib-MenC-TT booster dose at 12 months of age the MenC rSBA geometric mean titres induced in infants primed with a single MenC-CRM dose were not inferior to those induced in participants primed with two MenC-CRM doses in infancy (660 (95% confidence interval 498 to 876) v 295 (220 to 398)) with a corresponding difference in the mean log10 MenC rSBA of 0.35 (0.17 to 0.53) that showed superiority of the single over the two dose schedule). Exploration of differences between the priming schedules showed that one month after Hib-MenC-TT vaccination, MenC rSBA ≥1:8 was observed in >96% of participants previously primed with any of the MenC vaccine schedules in infancy and in 83% of those who were not vaccinated against MenC in infancy. The MenC rSBA geometric mean titres induced by the Hib-MenC-TT boost were significantly higher in children who were primed with one rather than two MenC-CRM doses in infancy. Only priming with MenC-TT, however, induced robust MenC bactericidal antibody after the Hib-MenC-TT booster that persisted until 24 months of age.

    > Conclusions
      MenC vaccination programmes with two MenC infant priming doses could be reduced to a single priming dose without reducing post-boost antibody titres. When followed by a Hib-MenC-TT booster dose, infant priming with a single MenC-TT vaccine dose induces a more robust antibody response than one or two infant doses of MenC-CRM. Bactericidal antibody induced by a single Hib-MenC-TT conjugate vaccine dose at 12 months of age (that is, a toddler only schedule), without infant priming, is not well sustained at 24 months. Because of rapid waning of MenC antibody, programmes using toddler only schedules will still need to rely on herd protection to protect infants and young children.

    head = In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups.

    > Background
      Older adults (aged ≥70 years) are at increased risk of severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed. Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.

    > Methods
      In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ≥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2 × 1010 virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18–55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56–69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5–6·5 × 1010 virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18–55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA80). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.

    > Findings
      Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18–55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56–69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ≥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18–55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56–69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18–55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56–69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 20 713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13 898–33 550], n=39; 56–69 years, 16 170 AU/mL [10 233–40 353], n=26; and ≥70 years 17 561 AU/mL [9705–37 796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA80 at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 193 [IQR 113–238], n=39; 56–69 years, 144 [119–347], n=20; and ≥70 years, 161 [73–323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18–55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841–2428], n=24; 56–69 years: 797 SFCs [383–1817], n=29; and ≥70 years: 977 SFCs [458–1914], n=48).

    > Interpretation
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.

She thinks this is because a lower first dose leads more quickly to the establishment of ‘memory’ immune cells that are triggered by a second-dose boost. Waiting longer between the two doses could achieve the same effect.

  ref 'Voysey_et_al_12_08_2020
    head = We present the first interim safety and efficacy data for a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, evaluated in four trials across three continents, showing significant vaccine efficacy of 70·4% after two doses and protection of 64·1% after at least one standard dose, against symptomatic disease, with no safety concerns.

    > Background
      A safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), if deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials.

    > Methods
      This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5 × 1010 viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674.

    > Findings
      Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the UK, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62·1% (95% CI 41·0–75·7; 27 [0·6%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs71 [1·6%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90·0% (67·4–97·0; three [0·2%] of 1367 vs 30 [2·2%] of 1374; pinteraction=0·010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70·4% (95·8% CI 54·8–80·6; 30 [0·5%] of 5807 vs 101 [1·7%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19, including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3·4 months, IQR 1·3–4·8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.

    > Interpretation
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.

  // Household Transmission of SARS-COV-2: Insights from a Population-based Serological Survey
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.04.20225573
  ref 'Bi_et_al_11_04_2020
    head = The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was four-times that of extra-household exposures over the first wave of the pandemic. Young children had a lower risk from infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections. While the small households in Geneva limit the contribution of household spread, household transmission likely plays a greater role in other settings.

    > Importance
      Knowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from household and community exposures is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.

    > Objective
      Estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.

    > Design
      Household serosurvey and transmission model.

    > Setting
      Population-based serosurvey in Geneva, Switzerland

    > Participants
      4,524 household members five years and older from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.

    > Exposures
      SARS-CoV-2 infected (seropositive) household members and background risk of community transmission.

    > Main outcomes and measures
      Past SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by ELISA. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households were used to estimate extra-household infection risk by demographics and reported extra-household contacts, and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infector’s symptoms. Infections attributable to exposure to different types of infectious individuals were estimated.

    > Results
      The chance of being infected by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.2% (95%CrI 13.6-21.5%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1% (95%CrI 4.5-5.8%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, from 7.5% (95%CrI 1.3-20.3%) among 5-9 years to 30.2% (95%CrI 14.3-48.2%) among those ≥65 years. Working-age adults (20-49 years) had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 74.8% lower odds (95%CrI 43.8-90.3%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 19.6% (95%CrI 12.9-24.5%) of all household infections.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was four-times that of extra-household exposures over the first wave of the pandemic. Young children had a lower risk from infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties and night clubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity that outbreak can be effectively contained with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the potential types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      COVID-19 caused rapid mass infection worldwide. Understanding its transmission characteristics, including heterogeneity and the emergence of super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases, is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. Here, we collected information of all infected cases (135 cases) between 21 January and 26 February 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China, and grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of four generations. Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54–0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13–0.88), respectively. A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin. In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January. Our results highlighted more efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors.

    > Abstract
      A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; P = 8 × 10−7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.

      We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 and the overdispersion parameter K at two regions in Indonesia: JakartaDepok and Batam. Based on the first 1288 confirmed cases in both regions, we find a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission. The basic reproduction number R0 is estimated at 6.79 and 2.47, while the overdispersion parameter K of a negative-binomial distribution is estimated at 0.06 and 0.2 for Jakarta-Depok and Batam, respectively. This suggests that superspreading events played a key role in the early stage of the outbreak, i.e., a small number of infected individuals are responsible for large amounts of COVID-19 transmission.

    > Abstract
      It is imperative to advance our understanding of heterogeneities in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 such as age-specific infectiousness and superspreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatiotemporal mechanistic framework to integrate individual surveillance data with geolocation data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We analyze reported cases, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the state of Georgia. First, our results show that the reproductive number reduced to below one in about 2 wk after the shelter-in-place order. Superspreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in rural areas and an increasing importance toward later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases were directly responsible for 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected nonelderly cases (<60 y) may be 2.78 [2.10, 4.22] times more infectious than the elderly, and the former tend to be the main driver of superspreading. Our results improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectiousness and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of superspreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.

  ref 'Xia_et_al_08_13_2020
    head = In this interim report of the phase 1 and phase 2 trials of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, patients had a low rate of adverse reactions and demonstrated immunogenicity; the study is ongoing. Efficacy and longer-term adverse event assessment will require phase 3 trials.

    > Objective
      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine in China.

    > Interventions
      In the phase 1 trial, 96 participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 dose groups (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/dose) and an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant–only group (n = 24 in each group), and received 3 intramuscular injections at days 0, 28, and 56. In the phase 2 trial, 224 adults were randomized to 5 μg/dose in 2 schedule groups (injections on days 0 and 14 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28], and days 0 and 21 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28]).

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      Interim analysis of ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The trials were conducted in Henan Province, China, among 96 (phase 1) and 224 (phase 2) healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years. Study enrollment began on April 12, 2020. The interim analysis was conducted on June 16, 2020, and updated on July 27, 2020.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      The primary safety outcome was the combined adverse reactions 7 days after each injection, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response 14 days after the whole-course vaccination, which was measured by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

    > Results
      Among 320 patients who were randomized (mean age, 42.8 years; 200 women [62.5%]), all completed the trial up to 28 days after the whole-course vaccination. The 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 (16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 (14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. There were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this interim report of the phase 1 and phase 2 trials of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, patients had a low rate of adverse reactions and demonstrated immunogenicity; the study is ongoing. Efficacy and longer-term adverse event assessment will require phase 3 trials.

    > Background
      The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic warrants accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans.

    > Methods
      We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan Province, China. In phase 1, healthy people aged 18–80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of screening, were separated into two age groups (18–59 years and ≥60 years) and randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18–59 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo on a single-dose schedule of 8 μg on day 0 or on a two-dose schedule of 4 μg on days 0 and 14, 0 and 21, or 0 and 28. Participants within each cohort were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation (block size eight) and allocated (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo. Group allocation was concealed from participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459.

    > Findings
      In phase 1, 192 participants were enrolled (mean age 53·7 years [SD 15·6]) and were randomly assigned to receive vaccine (2 μg [n=24], 4 μg [n=24], or 8 μg [n=24] for both age groups [18–59 years and ≥60 years]) or placebo (n=24). At least one adverse reaction was reported within the first 7 days of inoculation in 42 (29%) of 144 vaccine recipients. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (18–59 years, one [4%] in the 2 μg group, one [4%] in the 4 μg group, and two [8%] in the 8 μg group; ≥60 years, one [4%] in the 8 μg group). All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18–59 years (87·7 [95% CI 64·9–118·6], 2 μg group; 211·2 [158·9–280·6], 4 μg group; and 228·7 [186·1–281·1], 8 μg group) and the group aged 60 years and older (80·7 [65·4–99·6], 2 μg group; 131·5 [108·2–159·7], 4 μg group; and 170·87 [133·0–219·5], 8 μg group) compared with the placebo group (2·0 [2·0–2·0]). In phase 2, 448 participants were enrolled (mean age 41·7 years [SD 9·9]) and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (8 μg on day 0 [n=84] or 4 μg on days 0 and 14 [n=84], days 0 and 21 [n=84], or days 0 and 28 [n=84]) or placebo on the same schedules (n=112). At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days was reported in 76 (23%) of 336 vaccine recipients (33 [39%], 8 μg day 0; 18 [21%], 4 μg days 0 and 14; 15 [18%], 4 μg days 0 and 21; and ten [12%], 4 μg days 0 and 28). One placebo recipient in the 4 μg days 0 and 21 group reported grade 3 fever, but was self-limited and recovered. All other adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (one [1%], 8 μg day 0; one [1%], 4 μg days 0 and 14; three [4%], 4 μg days 0 and 21; two [2%], 4 μg days 0 and 28). The vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody titres on day 28 were significantly greater in the 4 μg days 0 and 14 (169·5, 95% CI 132·2–217·1), days 0 and 21 (282·7, 221·2–361·4), and days 0 and 28 (218·0, 181·8–261·3) schedules than the 8 μg day 0 schedule (14·7, 11·6–18·8; all p<0·001).

    > Interpretation
      The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in two age groups. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were induced in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Two-dose immunisation with 4 μg vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 achieved higher neutralising antibody titres than the single 8 μg dose or 4 μg dose on days 0 and 14.

      With the unprecedented morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We investigated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against COVID-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.

    > Methods
      In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial, healthy adults aged 18–59 years were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history, with axillary temperature above 37·0°C, or an allergic reaction to any vaccine component were excluded. The experimental vaccine for the phase 1 trial was manufactured using a cell factory process (CellSTACK Cell Culture Chamber 10, Corning, Wujiang, China), whereas those for the phase 2 trial were produced through a bioreactor process (ReadyToProcess WAVE 25, GE, Umea, Sweden). The phase 1 trial was done in a dose-escalating manner. At screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into two vaccination schedule cohorts, the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and within each cohort the first 36 participants were assigned to block 1 (low dose CoronaVac [3 μg per 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dose) then another 36 were assigned to block 2 (high-dose Coronavc [6 μg per 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dse]). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of CoronaVac or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose CoronaVac, high-dose CoronaVac, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352608, and is closed to accrual.

    > Findings
      Between April 16 and April 25, 2020, 144 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 trial, and between May 3 and May 5, 2020, 600 participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 743 participants received at least one dose of investigational product (n=143 for phase 1 and n=600 for phase 2; safety population). In the phase 1 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was seven (29%) of 24 participants in the 3 ug group, nine (38%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and two (8%) of 24 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was three (13%) of 24 in the 3 μg group, four (17%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and three (13%) of 23 in the placebo group. The seroconversion of neutralising antibodies on day 14 after the days 0 and 14 vaccination schedule was seen in 11 (46%) of 24 participants in the 3 μg group, 12 (50%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and none (0%) of 24 in the placebo group; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 vaccination schedule, seroconversion was seen in 20 (83%) of 24 in the 3 μg group, 19 (79%) of 24 in the 6 μg group, and one (4%) of 24 in the placebo group. In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was 40 (33%) of 120 participants in the 3 μg group, 42 (35%) of 120 in the 6 μg group, and 13 (22%) of 60 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was 23 (19%) of 120 in the 3 μg group, 23 (19%) of 120 in the 6 μg group, and 11 (18%) of 60 for the placebo group. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen for 109 (92%) of 118 participants in the 3 μg group, 117 (98%) of 119 in the 6 μg group, and two (3%) of 60 in the placebo group at day 14 after the days 0 and 14 schedule; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 schedule, seroconversion was seen in 114 (97%) of 117 in the 3 μg group, 118 (100%) of 118 in the 6 μg group, and none (0%) of 59 in the placebo group.

    > Interpretation
      Taking safety, immunogenicity, and production capacity into account, the 3 μg dose of CoronaVac is the suggested dose for efficacy assessment in future phase 3 trials.

    head = We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rSARS-CoV-2 vaccine (in 5-μg and 25-μg doses, with or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant, and with observers unaware of trial-group assignments) in 131 healthy adults.


    > Background
      NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant.

    > Methods
      We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–2 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rSARS-CoV-2 vaccine (in 5-μg and 25-μg doses, with or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant, and with observers unaware of trial-group assignments) in 131 healthy adults. In phase 1, vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity; laboratory values (serum chemistry and hematology), according to Food and Drug Administration toxicity scoring, to assess safety; and IgG anti–spike protein response (in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units). Secondary outcomes included unsolicited adverse events, wild-type virus neutralization (microneutralization assay), and T-cell responses (cytokine staining). IgG and microneutralization assay results were compared with 32 (IgG) and 29 (neutralization) convalescent serum samples from patients with Covid-19, most of whom were symptomatic. We performed a primary analysis at day 35.

    > Results
      After randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive placebo. No serious adverse events were noted. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration (mean, ≤2 days). One participant had mild fever that lasted 1 day. Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants; there were no severe adverse events. The addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen dose–sparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response. The two-dose 5-μg adjuvanted regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutralization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent serum from mostly symptomatic Covid-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).

    > Conclusions
      At 35 days, NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that exceeded levels in Covid-19 convalescent serum. The Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype.

    > Abstract
      The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made the development of a vaccine a top biomedical priority. In this study, we developed a series of DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and evaluated them in 35 rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers at levels comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. After vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in >3.1 and >3.7 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, as compared with viral loads in sham controls. Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates.

      Correlates of protection (CoPs) can play a significant role in vaccine development by assisting the selection of vaccine candidates for clinical trials, supporting clinical trial design and implementation, and simplifying tests of vaccine modifications. Because of this important role in vaccine development, it is essential that CoPs be defined by well-designed immunogenicity and efficacy studies, with attention paid to benefits and limitations. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) field is unique in that a great deal of information about the humoral response is available from basic research and clinical studies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been used routinely in the clinic to protect vulnerable infants from infection, providing a wealth of information about correlations between neutralizing antibodies and disease prevention. Considerations for the establishment of future CoPs to support RSV vaccine development in different populations are therefore discussed.

  // Association between antibody titers and protection against influenza virus infection within households.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu186
  ref 'Tsang_et_al_03_26_2014
    head = We demonstrated that an HAI titer of 1:40 was not sufficient to provide 50% protection against PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection in households, potentially because of exposures of greater duration or intensity in that confined setting. We also demonstrated that MN titers were statistically significantly correlated with protection against infection.

    > Background
      Previous studies have established that antibody titer measured by the hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) assay is correlated with protection against influenza virus infection, with an HAI titer of 1:40 generally associated with 50% protection.

    > Methods
      We recruited index cases with confirmed influenza virus infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7–10 days to identify secondary infections. Serum samples collected from a subset of household contacts were tested by HAI and microneutralization (MN) assays against prevalent influenza viruses. We analyzed the data using an individual hazard-based transmission model that adjusted for age and vaccination history.

    > Results 
      Compared to a reference group with antibody titers <1:10, we found that HAI titers of 1:40 against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were associated with 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13%–46%) and 31% (CI, 1%–53%) protection against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus infection, respectively, while an MN titer of 1:40 against A(H3N2) was associated with 49% (95% CI, 7%–81%) protection against PCR-confirmed A(H3N2) virus infection.

    > Conclusions 
      An HAI titer of 1:40 was associated with substantially less than 50% protection against PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection within households, perhaps because of exposures of greater duration or intensity in that confined setting.

    > Abstract
      Although the microneutralization (MN) assay has been shown to be more sensitive than the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay for the measurement of humoral immunity against influenza viruses, further evidence relating MN titres to protective efficacy against infection is needed. Serum antibodies against seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza were measured in children and adolescents (n = 656) by MN and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays. Compared to HAI, the MN assay is more sensitive in detecting serum antibodies and estimates of protective effectiveness against PCR-confirmed infection were higher for both subtypes. Given our findings, the MN assay warrants further consideration as a formal tool for the routine evaluation of vaccine-induced antibody responses.

    > Background
      The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available.

    > Methods
      We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS).

    > Results
      We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels.

    > Conclusions
      The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19. Trial registration number: NCT04436276

  ref 'Bovendo_et_al_11_01_2014
    head = This review will first summarize the contributions of the different arms of the immune system toward pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors. Then, the mechanisms of evasion of the main strategies developed to circumvent pre-existing Ad immunity will be reviewed.

    > Abstract
      Pre-existing immunity against human adenovirus (HAd) serotype 5 derived vector in the human population is widespread, thus hampering its clinical use. Various components of the immune system, including neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), Ad specific T cells and type I IFN activated NK cells, contribute to dampening the efficacy of Ad vectors in individuals with pre-existing Ad immunity. In order to circumvent pre-existing immunity to adenovirus, numerous strategies, such as developing alternative Ad serotypes, varying immunization routes and utilizing prime-boost regimens, are under pre-clinical or clinical phases of development. However, these strategies mainly focus on one arm of pre-existing immunity. Selection of alternative serotypes has been largely driven by the absence in the human population of nAbs against them with little attention paid to cross-reactive Ad specific T cells. Conversely, varying the route of immunization appears to mainly rely on avoiding Ad specific tissue-resident T cells. Finally, prime-boost regimens do not actually circumvent pre-existing immunity but instead generate immune responses of sufficient magnitude to confer protection despite pre-existing immunity. Combining the above strategies and thus taking into account all components regulating pre-existing Ad immunity will help further improve the development of Ad vectors for animal and human use.

    head = We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a rAd26 vector and rAd5 vector, both carrying the gene for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.



    > Background
      We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.

    > Methods
      We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18–60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon-γ concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875.

    > Findings
      Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49·25 with the frozen formulation and 45·95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2·5% CD4+ and 1·3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1·3% CD4+ and 1·1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.

    > Interpretation
      The heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants. Further investigation is needed of the effectiveness of this vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

    head = We report interim findings from this phase 1 clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine encoding a stabilized prefusion spike trimer, S-2P. We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. There were 15 participants in each dose group.

    > Background
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine. The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

    > Methods
      We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. There were 15 participants in each dose group.

    > Results
      After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-μg group, 109,209 in the 100-μg group, and 213,526 in the 250-μg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-μg dose group reported one or more severe adverse events.

    > Conclusions
      The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine.

    > Abstract
      We evaluated the effectiveness of 11 face coverings for material filtration efficiency, inward protection efficiency on a manikin, and outward protection efficiency on a manikin. At the most penetrating particle size, the vacuum bag, microfiber cloth, and surgical mask had material filtration efficiencies >50%, while the other materials had much lower filtration efficiencies. However, these efficiencies increased rapidly with particle size, and many materials had efficiencies >50% at 2 μm and >75% at 5 μm. The vacuum bag performed best, with efficiencies of 54-96% for all three metrics, depending on particle size. The thin acrylic and face shield performed worst. Inward protection efficiency and outward protection efficiency were similar for many masks; the two efficiencies diverged for stiffer materials and those worn more loosely (e.g., bandana) or more tightly (e.g., wrapped around the head) compared to a standard earloop mask. Discrepancies between material filtration efficiency and inward/outward protection efficiency indicated that the fit of the mask was important. We calculated that the particle size most likely to deposit in the respiratory tract when wearing a mask is ∼2 μm. Based on these findings, we recommend a three-layer mask consisting of outer layers of a flexible, tightly woven fabric and an inner layer consisting of a material designed to filter out particles. This combination should produce an overall efficiency of >70% at the most penetrating particle size and >90% for particles 1 μm and larger if the mask fits well.

    > Summary
      The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority. We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs. Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, a newly developed experimental set-up was used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses caused a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmitted efficiently. Serological assays confirmed all virus transmission events. Although the experiments did not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while travelling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the evidence for airborne virus transmission between humans under natural conditions is absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.

We speculate that narrow transmission bottlenecks and the lack of pervasive positive selection combine to constrain the pace of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 adaptive evolution in mammalian hosts.

    > Abstract
      The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapt to mammalian hosts and, potentially, escape human immunity depend on the ways genetic variation is generated and selected within and between individual hosts. Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, but dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. Transmission bottlenecks in this system appear narrow, with new infections being founded by fewer than ten viruses. We identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y) which arises rapidly in index cats and becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs, suggesting this site may be under positive selection in feline hosts.

    > Abstract
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, jumped into humans from an unknown animal reservoir in late 2019. In line with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to infect a broad range of hosts. SARS-CoV-2 genomes have now been isolated from cats, dogs, lions, tigers and minks. SARS-CoV-2 seems to transmit particularly well in mink farms with outbreaks reported in Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, the USA and Denmark. Genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 isolated from infected minks provides a natural case study of a secondary host jump of the virus, in this case from humans to animals, and occasionally back again. We screened published SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks for the presence of recurrent mutations common in mink but infrequent in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from human infections. We identify 23 recurrent mutations including three nonsynonymous mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that independently emerged at least four times but are only rarely observed in human lineages. The repeat emergence of mutations across phylogenetically distinct lineages of the virus isolated from minks points to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to a new host. The rapid acquisition and spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in minks suggests that if a similar phenomenon of host adaptation had occurred upon its jump into humans, those human-specific mutations would likely have reached fixation already before the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated.

These findings highlight the critical role of the S1/S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission.


    > Summary
      The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is posing major public health challenges. One unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the insertion of multi-basic residues at the S1/S2 subunit cleavage site, the function of which remains uncertain. We found that the virus with intact spike (Sfull) preferentially enters cells via fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas a clone (Sdel) with deletion disrupting the multi-basic S1/S2 site instead utilizes a less efficient endosomal entry pathway. This idea was supported by the identification of a suite of endosomal entry factors specific to Sdel virus by a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. A panel of host factors regulating the surface expression of ACE2 was identified for both viruses. Using a hamster model, animal-to-animal transmission with the Sdel virus was almost completely abrogated, unlike with Sfull. These findings highlight the critical role of the S1/S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission.

    > Summary
      SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via its spike glycoprotein which must be cleaved sequentially at the S1/S2, then the S2’ cleavage sites (CS) to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a unique polybasic insertion at the S1/S2 CS, which we demonstrate can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. We find this selective advantage depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin CS was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals. Thus, the polybasic CS is a key determinant for efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Animals could play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 disease transmission. The recently confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands due to mink could suggest that animal to human viral spillover is possible.

    > Abstract
      On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), a disease caused by a pathogen called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. This ongoing pandemic has now been reported in 215 countries with more than 23 million confirmed cases and more than 803 thousand deaths worldwide as of August 22, 2020. Although efforts are undergoing, there is no approved vaccine or any specific antiretroviral drug to treat COVID-19 so far. It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 can affect not only humans but also pets and other domestic and wild animals, making it a one health global problem. Several published scientific evidence has shown that bats are the initial reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, and pangolins are suggested as an intermediate hosts. So far, little is known concerning the role of pets and other animals in the transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, updated knowledge about the potential role of pets in the current outbreak will be of paramount importance for effective prevention and control of the disease. This review summarized the current evidence about the role of pets and other animals in the transmission of COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in five nasal swabs collected over a 13-day period from a 17-year-old neutered male Pomeranian. A 2.5-year-old male German shepherd was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on two occasions and virus was isolated from nasal and oral swabs. Antibody responses were detected in both dogs using plaque-reduction-neutralization assays.

    > Abstract
      Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses, can be dispersed and potentially transmitted by aerosols directly or via ventilation systems. We therefore investigated ventilation openings in one COVID-19 ward and central ducts that expel indoor air from three COVID-19 wards at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, during April and May 2020. Swab samples were taken from individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. Central ventilation HEPA filters, located several stories above the wards, were removed and portions analyzed in the same manner. In two subsequent samplings, SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes were detected in seven and four out of 19 room vents, respectively. Central ventilation HEPA exhaust filters from the ward were found positive for both genes in three samples. Corresponding filters from two other, adjacent COVID-19 wards were also found positive. Infective ability of the samples was assessed by inoculation of susceptible cell cultures but could not be determined in these experiments. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the relatively low air change rates in these wards. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be taken into consideration for preventive measures.

    > Abstract
      Evaluation of potential immunity against the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus that emerged in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for health, as well as social and economic recovery. Generation of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (seroconversion) may inform on acquired immunity from prior exposure, and antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) are speculated to neutralize virus infection. Some serology assays rely solely on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) as the antibody detection antigen; however, whether such immune responses correlate with S-RBD response and COVID-19 immunity remains unknown. Here, we generated a quantitative serological ELISA using recombinant S-RBD and N-protein for the detection of circulating antibodies in 138 serial serum samples from 30 reverse transcription PCR–confirmed, SARS-CoV-2–hospitalized patients, as well as 464 healthy and non–COVID-19 serum samples that were collected between June 2017 and June 2020. Quantitative detection of IgG antibodies against the 2 different viral proteins showed a moderate correlation. Antibodies against N-protein were detected at a rate of 3.6% in healthy and non–COVID-19 sera collected during the pandemic in 2020, whereas 1.9% of these sera were positive for S-RBD. Approximately 86% of individuals positive for S-RBD–binding antibodies exhibited neutralizing capacity, but only 74% of N-protein–positive individuals exhibited neutralizing capacity. Collectively, our studies show that detection of N-protein–binding antibodies does not always correlate with presence of S-RBD–neutralizing antibodies and caution against the extensive use of N-protein–based serology testing for determination of potential COVID-19 immunity.

    head = An outbreak of COVID-19 in a nursing home in the Netherlands, following an on-site church service held on March 8, 2020, triggered an investigation to unravel sources and chain(s) of transmission.

    > Background
      An outbreak of COVID-19 in a nursing home in the Netherlands, following an on-site church service held on March 8, 2020, triggered an investigation to unravel sources and chain(s) of transmission.

    > Methods
      Epidemiological data were collected from registries and through a questionnaire among church visitors. Symptomatic residents and healthcare workers (HCWs) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Sequences from a selection of people from the same area were included as community reference.

    > Results
      After the church service, 30 of 39 visitors (77%) developed symptoms; 14 were tested and were positive for COVID-19 (11 residents and 3 non-residents). In the following five weeks, 62 of 300 residents (21%) and 30 of 640 HCWs (5%) tested positive for COVID-19; 21 of 62 residents (34%) died. The outbreak was controlled through a cascade of measures. WGS of samples from residents and HCWs identified a diversity of sequence types, grouped into eight clusters. Seven resident church visitors all were infected with distinct viruses, four of which belonged to two larger clusters in the nursing home.

    > Conclusions
      Although initial investigation suggested the church service as source of the outbreak, detailed analysis showed a more complex picture, most consistent with widespread regional circulation of the virus in the weeks before the outbreak, and multiple introductions into the nursing home before the visitor ban. The findings underscore the importance of careful outbreak investigations to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission to develop evidence-based mitigation measures.

  // Sewage as a Possible Transmission Vehicle During a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak in a Densely populated Community: Guangzhou, China, April 2020
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1494
  ref 'Yuan_et_al_10_12_2020
    head = SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the fecal matter of COVID-19 patients. However, sewage transmission has never been shown. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission.

    > Background
      SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the fecal matter of COVID-19 patients. However, sewage transmission has never been shown. In April 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a densely populated community in Guangzhou, China. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission.

    > Method
      A home quarantined order was issued in the community. We collected throat swab samples from the residents and environmental samples from the surfaces inside and around the houses, and conducted RT-PCR testing and genome sequencing. We defined a case as a resident in this community with a positive RT-PCR test, with or without symptoms. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all residents living in the same buildings as the cases to identify exposure risk factors.

    > Result
      We found eight cases (four couples) in this community of 2888 residents (attack rate=2.8/1000), with onset during April 5–21, 2020. During their incubation periods, Cases 1-2 frequented market T with an ongoing outbreak. Cases 3-8 never visited market T during incubation period, lived in separate buildings from, and never interacted with, Cases 1-2. Retrospective cohort study showed that working as cleaners or waste picker (RR=13, 95% CIexact: 2.3-180), not changing to clean shoes after returning home (RR=7.4, 95% CIexact: 1.8-34), collating and cleaning dirty shoes after returning home (RR=6.3, 95% CIexact: 1.4-30) were significant exposure risk factors. Of 63 samples collected from street-sewage puddles and sewage-pipe surfaces, 19% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 50 environmental samples taken from cases’ apartments, 24% tested positive. Viral genome sequencing showed that the viruses identified from the squat toilet and shoe-bottom dirt inside the apartment of Cases 1-2 were homologous with those from Cases 3-8 and those identified from sewage samples. The sewage pipe leading from the apartment of Cases 1-2 to the drainage had a large hole above ground. Rainfalls after the onset of Cases 1-2 flooded the streets.

    > Conclusion
      Our investigation has for the first time pointed to the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might spread by sewage. This finding highlighted the importance of sewage management, especially in densely-populated places with poor hygiene and sanitation measures, such as urban slums and other low-income communities in developing countries.

  // Reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households by face mask use, disinfection and social distancing: a cohort study in Beijing, China
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002794
  ref 'Wang_et_al_05_28_2020
    head = A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case was conducted. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the family.

    > Introduction
      Transmission of COVID-19 within families and close contacts accounts for the majority of epidemic growth. Community mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing are thought to be effective but there is little evidence to inform or support community members on COVID-19 risk reduction within families.

    > Methods
      A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case was conducted from 28 February to 27 March 2020, in Beijing, China. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the family. Characteristics and practices of primary cases, of well family contacts and household hygiene practices were analysed as predictors of secondary transmission.

    > Results
      The secondary attack rate in families was 23.0% (77/335). Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79). Daily use of chlorine or ethanol based disinfectant in households was 77% effective (OR=0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84). Wearing a mask after illness onset of the primary case was not significantly protective. The risk of household transmission was 18 times higher with frequent daily close contact with the primary case (OR=18.26, 95% CI 3.93 to 84.79), and four times higher if the primary case had diarrhoea (OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.60). Household crowding was not significant.

    > Conclusion
      The study confirms the highest risk of transmission prior to symptom onset, and provides the first evidence of the effectiveness of mask use, disinfection and social distancing in preventing COVID-19. We also found evidence of faecal transmission. This can inform guidelines for community prevention in settings of intense COVID-19 epidemics.

  // SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV viral load dynamics, duration of viral shedding, and infectiousness: a systematic review and meta-analysis
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30172-5
  ref 'Cevik_et_al_11_19_2020
    head = This systematic review and meta-analysis provides comprehensive data on the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, including the duration of RNA shedding and viable virus isolation.

    > Background
      Viral load kinetics and duration of viral shedding are important determinants for disease transmission. We aimed to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA shedding, and viable virus shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in various body fluids, and to compare SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral dynamics.

    > Methods
      In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, and the grey literature, for research articles published between Jan 1, 2003, and June 6, 2020. We included case series (with five or more participants), cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that reported SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV infection, and reported viral load kinetics, duration of viral shedding, or viable virus. Two authors independently extracted data from published studies, or contacted authors to request data, and assessed study quality and risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools. We calculated the mean duration of viral shedding and 95% CIs for every study included and applied the random-effects model to estimate a pooled effect size. We used a weighted meta-regression with an unrestricted maximum likelihood model to assess the effect of potential moderators on the pooled effect size. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020181914.

    > Findings
      79 studies (5340 individuals) on SARS-CoV-2, eight studies (1858 individuals) on SARS-CoV, and 11 studies (799 individuals) on MERS-CoV were included. Mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 17·0 days (95% CI 15·5–18·6; 43 studies, 3229 individuals) in upper respiratory tract, 14·6 days (9·3–20·0; seven studies, 260 individuals) in lower respiratory tract, 17·2 days (14·4–20·1; 13 studies, 586 individuals) in stool, and 16·6 days (3·6–29·7; two studies, 108 individuals) in serum samples. Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope 0·304 [95% CI 0·115–0·493]; p=0·0016). No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, despite persistently high viral loads, which were inferred from cycle threshold values. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the first week of illness, whereas that of SARS-CoV peaked at days 10–14 and that of MERS-CoV peaked at days 7–10.

    > Interpretation
      Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. SARS-CoV-2 titres in the upper respiratory tract peak in the first week of illness. Early case finding and isolation, and public education on the spectrum of illness and period of infectiousness are key to the effective containment of SARS-CoV-2.

We reviewed and analyzed clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data of 74 pediatric cases of COVID-19 from 2 children’s hospitals within and beyond the epidemic center (from southern China and northern China, respectively).

    > Background and Objectives
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen that mainly spreads by droplets. Most published studies have been focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients are limited. In this study, we aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19.

    > Methods
      We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome, and follow-up results.

    > Results
      A total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 case patients whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65 of 68; 95.59%) were household contacts of adults. Cough (32.43%) and fever (27.03%) were the predominant symptoms of 44 (59.46%) symptomatic patients at onset of the illness. Abnormalities in leukocyte count were found in 23 (31.08%) children, and 10 (13.51%) children presented with abnormal lymphocyte count. Of the 34 (45.95%) patients who had nucleic acid testing results for common respiratory pathogens, 19 (51.35%) showed coinfection with other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. Ten (13.51%) children had real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for fecal specimens, and 8 of them showed prolonged existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

    > Conclusions
      Pediatric patients with COVID-19 presented with distinct epidemiological, clinical, and radiologic characteristics from adult patients. Nearly one-half of the infected children had coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens. It is not uncommon for pediatric patients to have prolonged fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the convalescent phase.

    > Background
      Since its identification on the 7th of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide, causing >11,000 deaths. At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters.

    > Methods
      We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms.

    > Findings
      Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were identified as having a paediatric index case. This is in contrast other zoonotic infections (namely H5N1 influenza virus) where 54% (30/56) of transmission clusters identified children as the index case.

    > Interpretation

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spread by direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people via infected respiratory droplets or saliva. Crowded indoor environments with sustained close contact and conversations are a particularly high-risk setting.

    > Methods
      We performed a meta-analysis through July 29, 2020 of SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR), disaggregating by several covariates (contact type, symptom status, adult/child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, index case sex, number of contacts in household, coronavirus).

    > Findings
      We identified 40 relevant published studies that report household secondary transmission. The estimated overall household SAR was 18.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4%-22.2%), which is higher than previously observed SARs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We observed that household SARs were significantly higher from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic index cases, to adult contacts than children contacts, to spouses than other family contacts, and in households with one contact than households with three or more contacts.

    > Interpretation
      To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, people are being asked to stay at home worldwide. With suspected or confirmed infections referred to isolate at home, household transmission will continue to be a significant source of transmission.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227699
  ref 'Asadi_et_al_01_27_2020
    head = We measured the respiratory particle emission rates of 56 healthy human volunteers voicing specific phones, both in isolation and in the context of a standard spoken text. The results suggest that airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens via speech aerosol particles could be modulated by specific phonetic characteristics of the language spoken by a given human population, along with other, more frequently considered epidemiological variables.

    > Abstract
      Previously, we demonstrated a strong correlation between the amplitude of human speech and the emission rate of micron-scale expiratory aerosol particles, which are believed to play a role in respiratory disease transmission. To further those findings, here we systematically investigate the effect of different ‘phones’ (the basic sound units of speech) on the emission of particles from the human respiratory tract during speech. We measured the respiratory particle emission rates of 56 healthy human volunteers voicing specific phones, both in isolation and in the context of a standard spoken text. We found that certain phones are associated with significantly higher particle production; for example, the vowel /i/ (“need,” “sea”) produces more particles than /ɑ/ (“saw,” “hot”) or /u/ (“blue,” “mood”), while disyllabic words including voiced plosive consonants (e.g., /d/, /b/, /g/) yield more particles than words with voiceless fricatives (e.g., /s/, /h/, /f/). These trends for discrete phones and words were corroborated by the time-resolved particle emission rates as volunteers read aloud from a standard text passage that incorporates a broad range of the phones present in spoken English. Our measurements showed that particle emission rates were positively correlated with the vowel content of a phrase; conversely, particle emission decreased during phrases with a high fraction of voiceless fricatives. Our particle emission data is broadly consistent with prior measurements of the egressive airflow rate associated with the vocalization of various phones that differ in voicing and articulation. These results suggest that airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens via speech aerosol particles could be modulated by specific phonetic characteristics of the language spoken by a given human population, along with other, more frequently considered epidemiological variables.

      Aerosols represent a potential transmission route of COVID-19. This study examined effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Simulated sunlight and matrix significantly affected decay rate of the virus. Relative humidity alone did not affect the decay rate; however, minor interactions between relative humidity and other factors were observed. Mean decay rates (± SD) in simulated saliva, under simulated sunlight levels representative of late winter/early fall and summer were 0.121 ± 0.017 min−1 (90% loss, 19 minutes) and 0.306 ± 0.097 min−1 (90% loss, 8 minutes), respectively. Mean decay rate without simulated sunlight across all relative humidity levels was 0.008 ± 0.011 min−1 (90% loss, 286 minutes). These results suggest that the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on environmental conditions, particularly sunlight. These data may be useful to inform mitigation strategies to minimize the potential for aerosol transmission.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be transmitted via airborne droplets or contact with surfaces onto which droplets have deposited. In this study, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to survive in the dark, at two different relative humidity values and within artificial saliva, a clinically relevant matrix, was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 was found to be stable, in the dark, in a dynamic small particle aerosol under the four experimental conditions we tested and viable virus could still be detected after 90 minutes. The decay rate and half-life was determined and decay rates ranged from 0.4 to 2.27 % per minute and the half lives ranged from 30 to 177 minutes for the different conditions. This information can be used for advice and modelling and potential mitigation strategies.

Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens. Stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance and disease severity.

    > Background
      A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort.

    > Methods
      We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

    > Results
      The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p<0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011).

    > Conclusions
      Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding.

    > Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. It is unclear whether convalescing patients have a risk of reinfection. We generated a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that was characterized by interstitial pneumonia and systemic viral dissemination mainly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Rhesus macaques reinfected with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain during the early recovery phase of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection did not show detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations of viral disease, or histopathological changes. Comparing the humoral and cellular immunity between primary infection and rechallenge revealed notably enhanced neutralizing antibody and immune responses.

    > Summary
      The COVID-19 pandemic urgently needs therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. Here, we report the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by high-throughput single-cell RNA and VDJ sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells from 60 convalescent patients. From 8,558 antigen-binding IgG1+ clonotypes, 14 potent neutralizing antibodies were identified, with the most potent one, BD-368-2, exhibiting an IC50 of 1.2 and 15 ng/mL against pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Additionally, the 3.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibody’s epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, we showed that human neutralizing antibodies could be efficiently discovered by high-throughput single B cell sequencing in response to pandemic infectious diseases.

    head = Using sequential samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals collected up to 94 d post onset of symptoms (POS), we demonstrate a typical antibody response after an acute viral infection where a peak response was detected 3–4 weeks post-infection, which then wanes. The magnitude of this peak is dependent on disease severity. For those who develop a low neutralizing antibody response (ID50 100–300), titres can return to baseline over a relatively short period, whereas those who develop a robust neutralizing antibody response maintain titres >1,000 despite the initial decline.

    > Abstract
      Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy′s and St Thomas′ Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection.

      COVID-19 CG is an open resource for tracking SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and lineages while filtering by location, date, gene, and mutation of interest. COVID-19 CG provides significant time, labor, and cost-saving utility to diverse projects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, emergence, immune interactions, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and intervention tracking. Here, we describe case studies in which users can interrogate (1) SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) across different geographic regions to inform the design and testing of therapeutics, (2) SNVs that may impact the sensitivity of commonly used diagnostic primers, and (3) the recent emergence of a dominant lineage harboring an S477N RBD mutation in Australia. To accelerate COVID-19 research and public health efforts, COVID-19 CG will be continually upgraded with new features for users to quickly and reliably pinpoint mutations as the virus evolves throughout the pandemic and in response to therapeutic and public health interventions.

    > Background
      The prevalence of true asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is critical to policy makers considering the effectiveness of mitigation measures against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible.

    > Methods
      We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe PMC (which covers pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv). We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies.

    > Results
      We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-PCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 4% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17% (95% CI: 14% - 20%) overall; higher in aged care 20% (14% - 27%), and lower in non-aged care 16% (13% - 20%). Five studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases. Overall, there was a 42% lower relative risk of asymptomatic transmission compared to symptomatic transmission (combined Relative Risk: 0.58; 95% CI 0.335-0.994, p=0.047).

    > Discussion
      Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.

  // A Rapid Review of the Asymptomatic Proportion of PCR-Confirmed  SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Community Settings
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108183
  ref 'Beale_et_al_05_23_2020
    head = Accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings.

    > Background
      Up to 80% of active SARS-CoV-2 infections are proposed to be asymptomatic based on cross-sectional studies. However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings.

    > Methods
      We searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published before 25/08/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold/genome copy number values and/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status, and age of asymptomatic versus (pre)symptomatic cases. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis.

    > Findings
      We screened 1138 studies and included 21. The pooled asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 23% (95% CI 16%-30%). When stratified by testing context, the asymptomatic proportion ranged from 6% (95% CI 0-17%) for household contacts to 47% (95% CI 21-75%) for non-outbreak point prevalence surveys with follow-up symptom monitoring. Estimates of viral load and duration of viral shedding appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on available data, though detailed reporting of viral load and natural history of viral shedding by symptom status were limited. Evidence into the relationship between age and symptom status was inconclusive.

    > Conclusion
      Asymptomatic viral shedding comprises a substantial minority of SARS-CoV-2 infections when estimated using methodologically-appropriate studies. Further investigation into variation in the asymptomatic proportion by testing context, the degree and duration of infectiousness for asymptomatic infections, and demographic predictors of symptom status are warranted.

      We aim to systematically review the characteristics of asymptomatic infection in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). PubMed and EMBASE were electronically searched to identify original studies containing the rate of asymptomatic infection in COVID‐19 patients before 20 May 2020. Then mate‐analysis was conducted using R version 3.6.2. A total of 50 155 patients from 41 studies with confirmed COVID‐19 were included. The pooled percentage of asymptomatic infection is 15.6% (95% CI, 10.1%‐23.0%). Ten included studies contain the number of presymptomatic patients, who were asymptomatic at screening point and developed symptoms during follow‐up. The pooled percentage of presymptomatic infection among 180 initially asymptomatic patients is 48.9% (95% CI, 31.6%‐66.2%). The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection among 1152 COVID‐19 children from 11 studies is 27.7% (95% CI, 16.4%‐42.7%), which is much higher than patients from all aged groups. Abnormal CT features are common in asymptomatic COVID‐19 infection. For 36 patients from 4 studies that CT results were available, 15 (41.7%) patients had bilateral involvement and 14 (38.9%) had unilateral involvement in CT results. Reduced white blood cell count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased C‐reactive protein were also recorded. About 15.6% of confirmed COVID‐19 patients are asymptomatic. Nearly half of the patients with no symptoms at detection time will develop symptoms later. Children are likely to have a higher proportion of asymptomatic infection than adults. Asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients could have abnormal laboratory and radiational manifestations, which can be used as screening strategies to identify asymptomatic infection.

  // Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: A living systematic review and meta-analysis
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003346
  ref 'Buitrago-Garcia_et_al_09_22_2020
    head = There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the proportion of cases without symptoms, and the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

    > Background
      There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic?

    > Methods and findings
      We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17–25) with a prediction interval of 3%–67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%–37%, prediction interval 24%–38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10–1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources.

    > Conclusions
      The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.

    > Background
      Reliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics not requiring laboratory infrastructure could be a game changer
      in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Global South. We assessed performance, limit of detection and ease-ofuse of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2.

    > Methods
      This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV2 in Germany and the UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected  from participants (one for clinical RT-PCR and one for Ag-RDT). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptoms  onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of the analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand the usability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.

    > Results
      Between April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76∙6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62∙8- 86∙4) sensitive and 99∙3% (CI 98∙6-99∙6) specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were  detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris  showed specificity of 93∙1% (CI 91∙0%-94∙8%) and 95∙8% (CI 93∙4%-97∙4%), respectively, not meeting the predefined target of ≥98%.

    > Conclusion
      There is large variability in performance of Ag-RDT with SD Biosensor showing promise. Given the usability at POC, this test is likely to have impact despite imperfect sensitivity; however further research and modelling are needed.

The sensitivity range of most AgPOCT overlaps with viral load figures typically observed during the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in the majority patients.


    > Background
      Antigen point of care tests (AgPOCT) can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 testing. As first AgPOCT are becoming available, there is a growing interest in their utility and performance.

    > Methods
      Here we compare AgPOCT products by seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test; the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag; the Healgen Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab); the Coris Bioconcept Covid.19 Ag Respi-Strip; the R-Biopharm RIDA QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen; the NAL von minden NADAL COVID19-Ag Test; and the Roche/SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored clinical samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (n=138), stored samples from patients with respiratory agents other than SARS-CoV-2 (n=100), as well as self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers (n=35).

    > Findings
      Limits of detection in six of seven tested products ranged between 2.08 X 106 and 2.88 X 107 copies per swab, the outlier at 1.58 X 1010 copies per swab. Specificities ranged between 98.53% and 100% in five products, with two outliers at 94.85% and 88.24%. False positive results were not associated with any specific respiratory agent. As some of the tested AgPOCT were early production lots, the observed issues with specificity are unlikely to persist.

    > Interpretation
      The sensitivity range of most AgPOCT overlaps with viral load figures typically observed during the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in the majority patients. AgPOCTs with a limit of detection that approximates the virus concentration above which patients are infectious may enable shortcuts in decision-making in various areas of healthcare and public health.

    head = Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

    > Background
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with respiratory-related disease and death. Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response.

    > Methods
      Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed using luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A subset of samples was tested both with and without heat inactivation.

    > Results
      At >14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike protein antibodies appearing between days 8 and 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, compared with immunocompetent patients.

    > Conclusions
      Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

    > Objectives
      Severe or critical COVID-19 is associated with intensive care unit admission, increased secondary infection rate, and would lead to significant worsened prognosis. Risks and characteristics relating to secondary infections in severe COVID-19 have not been described.

    > Results
      We found 57.89% (22/38) patients developed secondary infections. The patient receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or in critical state has a higher chance of secondary infections (P<0.0001). The most common infections were respiratory, blood-stream and urinary infections, and in respiratory infections, the most detected pathogens were gram-negative bacteria (26, 50.00%), following by gram-positive bacteria (14, 26.92%), virus (6, 11.54%), fungi (4, 7.69%), and others (2, 3.85%). Respiratory Infection rate post high flow, tracheal intubation, and tracheotomy were 12.90% (4/31), 30.43% (7/23), and 92.31% (12/13) respectively. Secondary infections would lead to lower discharge rate and higher mortality rate.

    head = We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae.

    > Background
      Data on the prevalence of bacterial and viral co-infections among patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure related to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are lacking. We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

    > Patients and methods
      In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure.

    > Results
      From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st–3rd quartiles [55–70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3–7] and SAPS II: 31 [21–40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin–clavulanate combination, respectively.

    > Conclusions
      We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the predictors of co-infection together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

    head = Based on 136 patients with a travel history to Hubei, the epicenter of COVID‐19, the COVID‐19 incubation period was found to be longer in older adults.

    > Objective
      The aim of this study was to explore any age‐related change in the incubation period of COVID‐19, specifically any difference between older (aged ≥65 years) and younger adults.

    > Methods
      Based on online data released officially by 21 Chinese cities from January 22 to February 15, 2020, the incubation period of COVID‐19 patients who had travelled to Hubei was studied according to age. Previous studies were reviewed and compared.

    > Results
      The study recruited 136 COVID‐19 patients who had travelled to Hubei during January 5‐31, 2020, stayed for 1‐2 days, and returned with symptom onset during January 10‐February 6, 2020. The median age was 50.5 years (range 1‐86 years), and 22 patients (16.2%) were aged ≥65 years. The age‐stratified incubation period was U‐shaped with higher values at extremes of age. The median COVID‐19 incubation period was 8.3 (90% confidence interval [CI], 7.4‐9.2) days for all patients, 7.6 (90% CI, 6.7‐8.6) days for younger adults, and 11.2 (90% CI, 9.0‐13.5) days for older adults. The 5th/25th/75th/90th percentiles were 2.3/5.3/11.3/14.2 days for all, 2.0/5.0/10.5/13.2 days for younger adults, and 3.1/7.8/14.4/17.0 days for older adults. There were 11 published studies on COVID‐19 incubation periods up to March 30, 2020, reporting means of 1.8‐7.2 days, and medians of 4‐7.5 days, but there was no specific study on the effect of age on incubation period. One study showed that severe COVID‐19 cases, which included more elderly patients, had longer incubation periods.

    > Conclusion
      Based on 136 patients with a travel history to Hubei, the epicenter of COVID‐19, the COVID‐19 incubation period was found to be longer in older adults. This finding has important implications for diagnosis, prevention, and control of COVID‐19.

    head = Ww found an association between shorter incubation periods among patients with MERS-CoV infection and a higher risk of death subsequently, similar to the association previously reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This association might occur because the duration of the incubation period is an early reflection of disease pathogenesis.

    > Abstract
      We analyzed data for 170 patients in South Korea who had laboratory-confirmed infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. A longer incubation period was associated with a reduction in the risk for death (adjusted odds ratio/1-day increase in incubation period 0.83, 95% credibility interval 0.68–1.03).

  ref 'Virlogeux_et_al_09_2015
    head = It is unlikely that a shorter incubation period itself is the cause of greater severity, but our results indicate that it could be a marker of underlying biologic processes that led to greater severity. A shorter incubation period could indicate a higher infective dose, leading to faster/greater pathogen replication, out-running adaptive immune responses or leading to a more aggressive and damaging inflammatory response, and thus leading to more severe disease.

    > Background
      Few previous studies have investigated the association between the severity of an infectious disease and the length of incubation period.

    > Methods
      We estimated the association between the length of the incubation period and the severity of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, using data from the epidemic in 2003 in Hong Kong.

    > Results
      We estimated the incubation period of SARS based on a subset of patients with available data on exposure periods and a separate subset of patients in a putative common source outbreak, and we found significant associations between shorter incubation period and greater severity in both groups after adjusting for potential confounders.

    > Conclusions
      Our findings suggest that patients with a shorter incubation period proceeded to have more severe disease. Further studies are needed to investigate potential biological mechanisms for this association.

  ref 'Hermesh_et_al_11_18_2010
    head = We discuss the concept of the “stealth phase”, defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the “stealth phase” phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.

    >
      Respiratory viruses cause disease in humans characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms. Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the “stealth phase”, defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the “stealth phase” phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.

    head = This study reports that total lymphocyte count and CD4+ T cell count are related with the outcome of the disease, with total lymphocyte count being a risk factor associated with the outcome of the disease. A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease. This suggests that immune response may be critical in directing disease progression at the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.

    > Background
      The emerging infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused an extreme health concern, with many patients having progressed to acute respiratory disease or other complications in a short period. Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive.

    > Methods
      A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis.

    > Results
      The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the non-aggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.

    > Conclusions
      A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.

    head = Our study demonstrated that patients with different incubation periods were different in clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and CT presentations. Shorter incubation was associated with the aggravation of lung involvement in CT scan.

    > Abstract
      The diagnosed COVID-19 cases revealed that the incubation periods (IP) varied a lot among patients. However, few studies had emphasized on the different clinical features and prognosis of patients with different IP. A total of 330 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and classified into immediate onset group(IP<3 days, I group, 57 cases) and late onset group(IP>10 days, L group, 75 cases) based on IP. The difference of clinical characteristics and prognosis of the two groups were compared. There were more patients with fever in I group than in L group(P = 0.003), and counts of all the total lymphocytes, total T lymphocytes, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes were significantly different between the two groups(all P < 0.01). Besides, patients in L group had more GGOs in CT scan than I group and there were more patients in I group receiving antibiotic treatment than in L group(P < 0.001). For disease aggravation, the median CT scores were comparable between the two groups, but individually, there were more patients with increased CT score during hospitalization in I group than in L group. The aggravation incidence of CT presentation was 21.1% in I group, significantly higher than L group(8.0%, P = 0.042). Multivariable COX models suggested that IP was the only independent factors for CT aggravation. Conclusively, patients with different IP were different in clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and CT presentations. Shorter IP was associated with the aggravation of lung involvement in CT scan.

The associations between the incubation periods and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients suggest that the incubation period may be a useful marker of disease severity and prognosis.

    > Purpose
      To investigate associations between the clinical characteristics and incubation periods of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.

    > Methods
      Complete clinical and epidemiological data from 149 patients with COVID-19 at a hospital in Hunan Province, China, were collected and retrospectively analyzed.

    > Results
      Analysis of the distribution and receiver operator characteristic curve of incubation periods showed that 7 days was the optimal cut-off value to assess differences in disease severity between groups. Patients with shorter (≤7 days) incubation periods (n = 79) had more severe disease, longer durations of hospitalization, longer times from symptom onset to discharge, more abnormal laboratory findings, and more severe radiological findings than patients with longer (>7 days) incubation periods. Regression and correlation analyses also showed that a shorter incubation period was associated with longer times from symptom onset to discharge.

    > Conclusion
      The associations between the incubation periods and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients suggest that the incubation period may be a useful marker of disease severity and prognosis.

    head = During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Some patients with Covid-19 do not have fever or radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation, which has complicated the diagnosis.

    > BACKGROUND
      Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.

    > METHODS
      We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.

    > RESULTS
      The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.)

    head = Our data indicated that RAD test was capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus in NPA & TS, NPS & TS, sputum and throat saliva with different sensitivities, this method was less sensitive than RT-PCR. Consequently, the negative results from this RAD method cannot exclude SARS-CoV-2 virus infection confidently and thus results should be verified by further RT-PCR testing.

  > Background
    The rapid diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is essential to reduce the disease spread. Rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests are available, however, there is scanty data on the performance of RAD tests.

  > Objective
    To evaluate the performance of the commercially available BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag test and compare it with RT-PCR for detecting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined for the RAD test using viral culture and RT-PCR as reference methods. The RAD test was further evaluated using respiratory samples collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results were compared with RT-PCR test.

  > Results
    The detection limits between RAD test, viral culture and RT-PCR varied hugely. RAD was 103 fold less sensitive than viral culture while RAD was 105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. The RAD test detected between 11.1 % and 45.7 % of RT-PCR-positive samples from COVID-19 patients.

  > Conclusions
    This study demonstrated that the RAD test serves only as adjunct to RT-PCR test because of potential for false-negative results.

    > Background
      The spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been described in case series and retrospective studies. In this study, we provide a coherent overview of the duration of viral detection and viral RNA load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity, and age.

    > Method
      We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1.11.2019 and 23.04.2020. We pooled the data of selected studies (22/7226 (650 patients) for meta-analysis) to estimate duration of viral detection and visualized viral load over time.

    > Findings
      Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT in adult patients (5•7 days in mild; 5•9 days in moderate-severe patients). The differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection for moderate-severe patients was observed in feces (15 days in mild vs. 21 days in moderate-severe patients) and the URT (12 days in mild vs. 16 days in moderate-severe patients). Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in earlier stages of infection in the URT compared to LRT.

IgG responses were detected in most patients in both the severe and mild groups at 9 days after onset, and remained at a high level throughout the study.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Little is known about the kinetics, tissue distribution, cross-reactivity, and neutralization antibody response in patients with COVID-19. Two groups of patients with RT-PCR–confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study: 12 severely ill patients in intensive care units who needed mechanical ventilation and 11 mildly ill patients in isolation wards. Serial clinical samples were collected for laboratory detection. Results showed that most of the severely ill patients had viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20–40 days after onset of disease (8/12, 66.7%), while the majority of mildly ill patients had viral shedding restricted to the respiratory tract and had no detectable virus RNA 10 days after onset (9/11, 81.8%). Mildly ill patients showed significantly lower IgM response compared with that of the severe group. IgG responses were detected in most patients in both the severe and mild groups at 9 days after onset, and remained at a high level throughout the study. Antibodies cross-reactive to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected in patients with COVID-19 but not in patients with MERS. High levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced after about 10 days after onset in both severely and mildly ill patients which were higher in the severe group. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization test and focus reduction neutralization test with authentic virus showed consistent results. Sera from patients with COVID-19 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry. Sera from convalescent patients with SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) did not. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 S and N IgG levels exhibited a moderate correlation with neutralization titers in patients’ plasma. This study improves our understanding of immune response in humans after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    head = We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by RT-qPCR. Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.


    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.

    > Methods
      We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.

    > Findings
      Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0·15, 95% CI −0·19 to −0·11; R2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.

    > Interpretation
      Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

    > Aim
      In addition to respiratory symptoms, COVID‐19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints suggesting possible faeco‐oral transmission. The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS‐CoV‐2 in patients with COVID‐19.

    > Methods
      A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID‐19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for MEDLINE included ‘clinical’, ‘faeces’, ‘gastrointestinal secretions’, ‘stool’, ‘COVID‐19’, ‘SARS‐CoV‐2’ and ‘2019‐nCoV’. Additional searches were done in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the World Health Organization Database, the Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, social media and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco‐oral transmission of the virus.

    > Results
      Twenty‐six relevant articles were identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. The duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID‐19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus.

    > Conclusion
      There is a high rate of positive polymerase chain reaction tests with persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID‐19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco‐oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.

    > Abstract
      In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally. However, the transmission route of SARS‐CoV‐2 has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate SARS‐CoV‐2 shedding in the excreta of COVID‐19 patients. Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool, and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA by real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and its correlation analyzed with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. A total of 42 laboratory‐confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in stool specimens, and this was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in the feces after the pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from the feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6‐10) days, regardless of COVID‐19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did not differ between patients who tested positive and negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in the feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients. Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in the feces of COVID‐19 patients and suggested the possibility of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission via the fecal‐oral route.

  ref 'Kampen_et_al_06_09_2020
    head = We assessed the duration and determinants of infectiousness using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding.

    > Background
      Long-term shedding of viral RNA in COVID-19 prevents timely discharge from the hospital or de-escalation of infection prevention and control practices. Key questions are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. We assessed these questions using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding.
    > Methods
      Clinical and virological data were obtained from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (89 intensive care, 40 medium care). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify if viral RNA load, detection of viral subgenomic RNA, serum neutralizing antibody response, duration of symptoms, or immunocompromised status were predictive for a positive virus culture.
    > Findings
      Infectious virus shedding was detected in 23 of the 129 patients (17,8%). The median duration of shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and the probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13,4-17,2). Multivariate analyses identified viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p<0,001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p<0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.
    > Interpretation
      Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Infectious virus shedding drops to undetectable levels below a viral RNA load threshold and once serum neutralizing antibodies are present, which warrants the use of quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.

  ref 'Fikenzer_et_al_07_06_2020
    head = The results from this first randomized cross-over study assessing the effects of surgical masks and FFP2/N95 masks on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity states clearly that ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals.

    > Background
      Due to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, medical face masks are widely recommended for a large number of individuals and long durations. The effect of wearing a surgical and a FFP2/N95 face mask on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity has not been systematically reported.

    > Methods
      This prospective cross-over study quantitated the effects of wearing no mask (nm), a surgical mask (sm) and a FFP2/N95 mask (ffpm) in 12 healthy males (age 38.1 ± 6.2 years, BMI 24.5 ± 2.0 kg/m2). The 36 tests were performed in randomized order. The cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses were monitored by ergo-spirometry and impedance cardiography. Ten domains of comfort/discomfort of wearing a mask were assessed by questionnaire.

    > Results
      The pulmonary function parameters were significantly lower with mask (forced expiratory volume: 5.6 ± 1.0 vs 5.3 ± 0.8 vs 6.1 ± 1.0 l/s with sm, ffpm and nm, respectively; p = 0.001; peak expiratory flow: 8.7 ± 1.4 vs 7.5 ± 1.1 vs 9.7 ± 1.6 l/s; p < 0.001). The maximum power was 269 ± 45, 263 ± 42 and 277 ± 46 W with sm, ffpm and nm, respectively; p = 0.002; the ventilation was significantly reduced with both face masks (131 ± 28 vs 114 ± 23 vs 99 ± 19 l/m; p < 0.001). Peak blood lactate response was reduced with mask. Cardiac output was similar with and without mask. Participants reported consistent and marked discomfort wearing the masks, especially ffpm.

    > Conclusion
      Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals. These data are important for recommendations on wearing face masks at work or during physical exercise.

    quote !f = Surgical masks, and to a greater extent FFP2/N95 masks, reduce the maximum power. Pmax (Watt) depends on energy consumption and the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). The reduction of Pmax was primarily driven by the observed reduction of the arterio-venous oxygen content (avDO2). Therefore, the primary effect of the face masks on physical performance in healthy individuals is driven by the reduction of pulmonary function. In addition, the auxiliary breathing muscles have been described to induce an additional afferent drive which can contribute to an increase of the fatigue effect.

    quote !g = The performance of several different populations may be significantly affected by face masks. For athletes the use of fm will reduce physical performance. Less pronounced but mechanistically similar effects have been observed for mouthguards. The increased breathing resistance is especially problematic for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Patients with diffusion disorders have reduced capacity to compensate due to the reduced tidal volume. Another example of a population at risk is patients with heart failure. The observed mechanisms may lead to more severe symptoms in individuals with impaired capacity for myocardial compensation.

    / July, 2020 - Clinical Research in Cardiology
    quote !h = Our data show that FM leads to severe subjective discomfort during exercise. FFP2/N95 masks are perceived as more uncomfortable than sm. In particular, breathing resistance, heat, tightness and overall discomfort are the items with the greatest influence on subjective perception.  Wearing of fm is perceived as subjectively disturbing and is accompanied by an increased perception of exertion. It is likely that the masks negatively impact on the dynamics of perception especially at the limit of exercise tolerance. In addition to the severe impact on ventilation, the data suggest the associated discomfort as a second important reason for the observed impairment of physical performance.

    head = N95 and surgical facemasks can induce significantly different temperatures and humidity in the microclimates of facemasks, which have profound influences on heart rate and thermal stress and subjective perception of discomfort.

    > Aim
      The study was aimed at investigating the effects of wearing N95 and surgical facemasks with and without nano-functional treatments on thermophysiological responses and the subjective perception of discomfort.

    >
      Method Five healthy male and five healthy female participants performed intermittent exercise on a treadmill while wearing the protective facemasks in a climate chamber controlled at an air temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of 70%. Four types of facemasks, including N95 (3M 8210) and surgical facemasks, which were treated with nano-functional materials, were used in the study.

    > Results
      (1) The subjects had significantly lower average heart rates when wearing nano-treated and untreated surgical facemasks than when wearing nano-treated and untreated N95 facemasks. (2) The outer surface temperature of both surgical facemasks was significantly higher than that of both N95 facemasks. On the other hand, the microclimate and skin temperatures inside the facemask were significantly lower than those in both N95 facemasks. (3) Both surgical facemasks had significantly higher absolute humidity outside the surface than both N95 facemasks. The absolute humidity inside the surgical facemask was significantly lower than that inside both N95 facemasks. (4) Both surgical facemasks were rated significantly lower for perception of humidity, heat, breath resistance and overall discomfort than both N95 facemasks. The ratings for other sensations, including feeling unfit, tight, itchy, fatigued, odorous and salty, that were obtained while the subjects were wearing the surgical facemasks were significantly lower than when the subjects were wearing the N95 facemasks. (5) Subjective preference for the nano-treated surgical facemasks was the highest. There was significant differences in preference between the nano-treated and untreated surgical facemasks and between the surgical and N95 facemasks.

    > Discussion
      We discuss how N95 and surgical facemasks induce significantly different temperature and humidity in the microclimates of the facemasks, which have profound influences on heart rate and thermal stress and subjective perception of discomfort.

      While the mechanisms of adaptive immunity to pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown, the immune response to the widespread endemic coronaviruses HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43 provide a useful reference for understanding repeat infection risk.

    > Methods
      Here we used data from proactive sampling carried out in New York City from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined weekly nasal swab collection with self-reports of respiratory symptoms from 191 participants to investigate the profile of recurring infections with endemic coronaviruses.

    > Results
      During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity but strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family.

    > Abstract
      The permanence of rt-PCR positivity after a long time in COVID-19 patients has prompted the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 could cause a persistent infection or patients can become re-infected by this virus. Both possibilities could have critical implications for the management and control of COVID-19. Here we present the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Ecuador and South America.

    > Materials and methods
      Our diagnostic laboratory detected a potential re-infection in one patient who was SARS-COv2 rt-PCR positive twice (in May and July 2020). The first laboratory-confirmed infection presented with mild symptoms and full recovery, reaffirmed by a negative RT-PCR test result obtained two weeks after symptom onset. More severe COVID-19-like symptoms presented again four weeks after the first event, and a third RT-PCR test was performed which resulted positive. The total RNA extraction (from the samples collected on both occasions) was sequenced in an Oxford Nanopore MinION using a tilling PCR protocol developed by the ARTIC-Network, and the reads were analyzed using the artic-medaka consensus generation tool. Anti SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were investigated.

Viral genomes from first and second episodes belong to different clades/lineages. Despite having an acute infection as evidenced by an elevated CRP, relatively high viral load with gradual decline (Ct value-26.69 upon hospitalization), and seroconversion, the patient was asymptomatic during the second episode.

    > Background
      Waning immunity occurs in patients who have recovered from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it remains unclear whether true re-infection occurs.

    > Methods
      Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during 2 episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Comparative genome analysis was conducted to differentiate re-infection from persistent viral shedding. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR Ct values and serum Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG, were analyzed.

    > Results
      The second episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 days after the first symptomatic episode in an apparently immunocompetent patient. During the second episode, there was evidence of acute infection including elevated C-reactive protein and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. Viral genomes from first and second episodes belong to different clades/lineages. The virus genome from the first episode contained a a stop codon at position 64 of ORF8, leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids. Another 23 nucleotide and 13 amino acid differences located in 9 different proteins, including positions of B and T cell epitopes, were found between viruses from the first and second episodes. Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the first virus genome was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the second virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020.

    > Conclusions
      Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among humans despite herd immunity due to natural infection. Further studies of patients with re-infection will shed light on protective immunological correlates for guiding vaccine design.

    > Background
      The degree of protective immunity conferred by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently unknown. As such, the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. We describe an investigation of two instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual.

    > Methods
      A 25-year-old man who was a resident of Washoe County in the US state of Nevada presented to health authorities on two occasions with symptoms of viral infection, once at a community testing event in April, 2020, and a second time to primary care then hospital at the end of May and beginning of June, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation and twice during follow-up. Nucleic acid amplification testing was done to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Sequence data were assessed by two different bioinformatic methodologies. A short tandem repeat marker was used for fragment analysis to confirm that samples from both infections came from the same individual.

    > Findings
      The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences between each variant associated with each instance of infection. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first.

    > Interpretation
      Genetic discordance of the two SARS-CoV-2 specimens was greater than could be accounted for by short-term in vivo evolution. These findings suggest that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by a genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases. All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with COVID-19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application.

The levels of specific cytokines vary substantially between people, making it hard to benchmark a level of cytokine expression that constitutes a sign of abnormality. Therefore, groups of cytokines, each with different degrees of inter-individual variability, must be measured to identify useful alterations.

    > Abstract
      The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT–qPCR) assays are being used by clinical, research and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear whether results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to make independent evaluations of primer–probe sets used in four common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. From our comparisons of RT–qPCR analytical efficiency and sensitivity, we show that all primer–probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 viral RNA copies per reaction. The exception for this is the RdRp-SARSr (Charité) confirmatory primer–probe set which has low sensitivity, probably due to a mismatch to circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the reverse primer. We did not find evidence for background amplification with pre-COVID-19 samples or recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution decreasing sensitivity. Our recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is to select an assay with high sensitivity and that is regionally used, to ease comparability between outcomes.

We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay.

    > Abstract
      Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemic's trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.

    head = The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

    > Background
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health. Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients.

    > Methods
      Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time.

    > Findings
      SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P<0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: < 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response.

    > Interpretation
      The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

    > Abstract
      Although the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating, public health strategies have transitioned from containment to harm reduction. In light of this paradigm shift, it is critical that individuals take steps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the United States, the CDC recommends that individuals wear face coverings in public places, such as grocery stores. As lockdowns are being phased out around the world, authorities are requiring the use of such masks in public places while maintaining social distance. Individuals (including healthcare professionals outside of their clinical settings) and manufacturers are following the CDC’s recommendation. But, many currently available masks are not form-fitting, are not customizable, and are uncomfortable with even short-term use, thereby undercutting their effectiveness. Moreover, because cotton absorbs and retains the moisture found in an exhaled breath masks made of cotton have the potential to increase the wearer’s risk of infection. Thus, as we shift to harm reduction and social distancing measures relax, it is imperative that these shortcomings in fabric masks are addressed and that is the motivation for this research. The overall objective of the research is to design, develop, and test a fabric mask that is effective while being comfortable during continuous use over long periods of time. As the first step in the design process, we reviewed the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We analyzed a medical mask and a fabric mask in the market and identified their shortcomings. We carried out an in-depth analysis of user needs and developed the performance requirements of the proposed mask. We defined the architecture of the mask comprising the following principal components: Barrier, Form-Fitting, Positioning, and Fastening. We tested and evaluated candidate materials for the components and developed the design specifications and construction details for the mask. We produced the mask and carried out subjective testing on a user in a typical workplace setting; we demonstrated that the mask was form-fitting, customizable, washable, and could be worn continuously and routinely over extended periods of time by individuals and therefore could serve as an effective means to reduce the harm from SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      In the case of pandemic crisis situations, a crucial lack of protective material such as protective face masks for healthcare professionals can occur. A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed. Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.

  // Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflections on public health measures.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329
  ref 'Wu_et_al_04_02_2020
    head = We provide a summary of the public health measures by the Chinese government concerning facemasks. Facemasks shortage, particularly for N95, would occur regardless of the implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. The facemask shortage could be much more severe if a universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in the whole of China rather than the most severely affected areas. The shortage of N95 facemask were not alleviated under the existing public health measures.

    > Background
      A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.

    > Methods
      We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.

    > Findings
      Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million.

    > Interpretation
      Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.

The framework consists of eight questions framed around ethical values, and a decision-making tree  which agencies can follow through the process from planning, to policy development and enactment and, finally, action in a crisis.

    > Abstract
      Disasters involving severe air pollution episodes create a pressing public health issue. During such emergencies, there may be pressure on agencies to provide solutions to protect affected communities. One possible intervention to reduce exposure during such crises is facemasks. Ethical values need to be considered as part of any decision-making process to assess whether to provide advice on, recommend and/or distribute any public health intervention. In this paper, we use principles from public health ethics to analyse the critical ethical issues that relate to agencies providing advice on, recommending and/or distributing facemasks in air pollution disasters, given a lack of evidence of both the specific risk of some polluting events or the effectiveness of facemasks in community settings. The need for reflection on the ethical issues raised by the possible recommendation/use of facemasks to mitigate potential health issues arising from air pollution disasters is critical as communities progressively seek personal interventions to manage perceived and actual risks. This paper develops an ethical decision-making framework to assist agency deliberations. We argue that clarity around decision-making by agencies, after using this framework, may help increase trust about the intervention and solidarity within and between populations affected by these disasters and the agencies who support public health or provide assistance during disasters.

    > Abstract
      N95 respirators comprise a critical part of the personal protective equipment used by frontline health-care workers and are typically meant for one-time usage. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g., use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post-decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration efficiency.

Sustainable PPE, made from bioplastics, will facilitate effective waste management and inform technology disruption.

    > Abstract
      Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with the occurrence of repeat waves of infection frequently stretching hospital resources beyond capacity. Disease countermeasures rely upon preventing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV2 so as to protect front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). COVID-19 brings enormous challenges in terms of sustaining the supply chain for single-use-plastic personal and protective equipment (PPE). Post-COVID-19, the changes in medical practice will drive high demand for PPE. Important countermeasures for preventing COVID-19 transmission include mitigating potential high risk aerosol transmission in healthcare setting using medical PPE (such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs)) and the appropriate use of face coverings by the general public that carries a lower transmission risk. PPE reuse is a potential short term solution during COVID-19 pandemic where there is increased evidence for effective deployment of reprocessing methods such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (30 to 35% VH2OH) used alone or combined with ozone, ultraviolet light at 254 nm (2000 mJ/cm2) and moist heat (60 °C at high humidity for 60 min). Barriers to PPE reuse include potentially trust and acceptance by HCWs. Efficacy of face coverings are influenced by the appropriate wearing to cover the nose and mouth, type of material used, number of layers, duration of wearing, and potentially superior use of ties over ear loops. Insertion of a nose clip into cloth coverings may help with maintaining fit. Use of 60 °C for 60 min (such as, use of domestic washing machine and spin dryer) has been advocated for face covering decontamination. Risk of virus infiltration in improvised face coverings is potentially increased by duration of wearing due to humidity, liquid diffusion and virus retention. Future sustained use of PPE will be influenced by the availability of recyclable PPE and by innovative biomedical waste management.

    > Abstract
      Although the benefit of population-level public facial masking to protect others during the COVID-19 pandemic has received a great deal of attention, we discuss for one of the first times the hypothesis that universal masking reduces the “inoculum” or dose of the virus for the mask-wearer, leading to more mild and asymptomatic infection manifestations. Masks, depending on type, filter out the majority of viral particles, but not all. We first discuss the near-century-old literature around the viral inoculum and severity of disease (conceptualized as the LD50 or lethal dose of the virus). We include examples of rising rates of asymptomatic infection with population-level masking, including in closed settings (e.g., cruise ships) with and without universal masking. Asymptomatic infections may be harmful for spread but could actually be beneficial if they lead to higher rates of exposure. Exposing society to SARS-CoV-2 without the unacceptable consequences of severe illness with public masking could lead to greater community-level immunity and slower spread as we await a vaccine. This theory of viral inoculum and mild or asymptomatic disease with SARS-CoV-2 in light of population-level masking has received little attention so this is one of the first perspectives to discuss the evidence supporting this theory.

    head = The vocabulary used in exposure science and industrial hygiene to describe aerosols and their respiratory tract deposition does not correspond well to the way the terms “respiratory droplets” and “aerosols” are frequently used by the medical infectious disease community. The resulting communication difficulty hampers effective and timely collaborative efforts. The aim of this document is to come to a better and ultimately transdisciplinary understanding of the modes of respiratory infection transmission.

    head = The potential for a substantial viral load within the wastewater plumbing system (and therefore the main sewer system), in combination with the potential for airborne transmission due to aerosolisation of the virus, calls for wastewater plumbing systems to be considered as a potential transmission pathway for COVID-19. The interconnectedness of the wastewater plumbing network can facilitate exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within, or even between, buildings. This is of particular concern in high-risk transmission settings such as hospitals and health-care buildings.

    > Abstract
      Violent respiratory events such as coughs and sneezes play a key role in transferring respiratory diseases between infectious and susceptible individuals. We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the fluid dynamics of such violent expiratory events. Direct observation of sneezing and coughing events reveals that such flows are multiphase turbulent buoyant clouds with suspended droplets of various sizes. Our observations guide the development of an accompanying theoretical model of pathogen-bearing droplets interacting with a turbulent buoyant momentum puff. We develop in turn discrete and continuous models of droplet fallout from the cloud in order to predict the range of pathogens. According to the discrete fallout model droplets remain suspended in the cloud until their settling speed matches that of the decelerating cloud. A continuous fallout model is developed by adapting models of sedimentation from turbulent fluids. The predictions of our theoretical models are tested against data gathered from a series of analogue experiments in which a particle-laden cloud is ejected into a relatively dense ambient. Our study highlights the importance of the multiphase nature of respiratory clouds, specifically the suspension of the smallest drops by circulation within the cloud, in extending the range of respiratory pathogens.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12445
  ref 'Lei_et_al_12_15_2017
    head = Our identification of the dominated routes, that is the close contact route (large droplet) for influenza, the fomite route for norovirus, and all 3 routes for SARS CoV, suggested the relative importance of different environment intervention for different infectious diseases in air cabins and probably also in other indoor environments. For minimizing in‐flight fomite transmission, the aisle seatbacks and toilets should be cleaned and disinfected effectively.

    > Abstract
      Identifying the exact transmission route(s) of infectious diseases in indoor environments is a crucial step in developing effective intervention strategies. In this study, we proposed a comparative analysis approach and built a model to simulate outbreaks of 3 different in‐flight infections in a similar cabin environment, that is, influenza A H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), and norovirus. The simulation results seemed to suggest that the close contact route was probably the most significant route (contributes 70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%‐72%) in the in‐flight transmission of influenza A H1N1 transmission; as a result, passengers within 2 rows of the index case had a significantly higher infection risk than others in the outbreak (relative risk [RR]: 13.4, 95% CI: 1.5‐121.2, P = .019). For SARS CoV, the airborne, close contact, and fomite routes contributed 21% (95% CI: 19%‐23%), 29% (95% CI: 27%‐31%), and 50% (95% CI: 48%‐53%), respectively. For norovirus, the simulation results suggested that the fomite route played the dominant role (contributes 85%, 95% CI: 83%‐87%) in most cases; as a result, passengers in aisle seats had a significantly higher infection risk than others (RR: 9.5, 95% CI: 1.2‐77.4, P = .022). This work highlighted a method for using observed outbreak data to analyze the roles of different infection transmission routes.

    head = A basic and consistent pressure-based formulation is firstly revisited for natural ventilation of multi-zone buildings with multiple openings for both buoyancy and wind-driven flows.  A simple and easy implementation method is then presented for the simplest situation of bi-directional flows,, i.e. the temperature in each zone is uniform. A reasonable agreement has been found between the results predicted by the pressure-based formulation and those predicted by the analytical solutions and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods.


    > Abstract
      This paper first presents a consistent pressure-based formulation for natural ventilation of single-zone and multi-zone buildings with multiple openings. Pressure-based multi-zone formulation is made easier to implement by introducing an auxiliary concept of external pressure, which allows all the formulas to be presented in an integrated form. Multi-zone situations considered include vertically interconnected zones, and horizontally interconnected zones with same heights and dierent heights. The formulation includes the combined effect of wind, thermal buoyancy and mechanical ventilation, and it can be used for both external and internal large openings. A simple and easy implementation method was then presented. Single-zone and multi-zone analytical solutions are revisited or developed by the pressure-based formulations and used for the validation of the implementation method. A CFD method is also used to cross-check the implementation method in a single-zone building with very large external openings. A reasonable agreement has been found between the results predicted by the pressure-based formulation and those predicted by the analytical solutions and CFD methods.

    > Background
      The role of fecal aerosols in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been suspected.

    > Objective
      To investigate the temporal and spatial distributions of 3 infected families in a high-rise apartment building and examine the associated environment variables to verify the role of fecal aerosols.

    head = In this cohort study of 128 individuals who rode 1 of 2 buses and attended a worship event, those who rode a bus with air recirculation and with a patient with COVID-19 had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those who rode a different bus.

    > Importance
      Evidence of whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can be transmitted as an aerosol (ie, airborne) has substantial public health implications.

    > Objective
      To investigate potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection with epidemiologic evidence from a COVID-19 outbreak.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      This cohort study examined a community COVID-19 outbreak in Zhejiang province. On January 19, 2020, 128 individuals took 2 buses (60 [46.9%] from bus 1 and 68 [53.1%] from bus 2) on a 100-minute round trip to attend a 150-minute worship event. The source patient was a passenger on bus 2. We compared risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection among at-risk individuals taking bus 1 (n = 60) and bus 2 (n = 67 [source patient excluded]) and among all other individuals (n = 172) attending the worship event. We also divided seats on the exposed bus into high-risk and low-risk zones according to the distance from the source patient and compared COVID-19 risks in each zone. In both buses, central air conditioners were in indoor recirculation mode.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or by viral genome sequencing results. Attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated for different groups, and the spatial distribution of individuals who developed infection on bus 2 was obtained.

    > Results
      Of the 128 participants, 15 (11.7%) were men, 113 (88.3%) were women, and the mean age was 58.6 years. On bus 2, 24 of the 68 individuals (35.3% [including the index patient]) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after the event. Meanwhile, none of the 60 individuals in bus 1 were infected. Among the other 172 individuals at the worship event, 7 (4.1%) subsequently received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Individuals in bus 2 had a 34.3% (95% CI, 24.1%-46.3%) higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared with those in bus 1 and were 11.4 (95% CI, 5.1-25.4) times more likely to have COVID-19 compared with all other individuals attending the worship event. Within bus 2, individuals in high-risk zones had moderately, but nonsignificantly, higher risk for COVID-19 compared with those in the low-risk zones. The absence of a significantly increased risk in the part of the bus closer to the index case suggested that airborne spread of the virus may at least partially explain the markedly high attack rate observed.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this cohort study and case investigation of a community outbreak of COVID-19 in Zhejiang province, individuals who rode a bus to a worship event with a patient with COVID-19 had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individuals who rode another bus to the same event. Airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 seems likely to have contributed to the high attack rate in the exposed bus. Future efforts at prevention and control must consider the potential for airborne spread of the virus.

      The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world, representing a global pandemic, counting, as of June 5th, 2020, over 6,600,000 confirmed cases and more than 390,000 deaths, with exponentially increasing numbers. In the first half of 2020, because of the widespread of the COVID-19, researches were focused on the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in water, wastewater, sludge, air, and on surfaces, in order to assess the risk of contracting the viral infection from contaminated environments. So far, the survival of the novel Coronavirus out of the human body has been reported for short time periods (from hours to few days, in optimized in vitro conditions), mainly because of the need of an host organism which could consent the viral attack, and due to the weak external membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding strategies in the environment, either through animate and unanimate matrices, or exploiting the organic matter in water, wastewater, and waste in general, have been discussed in the present article. We concluded that, besides the high infectuousness of the novel Coronavirus, the transmission of the pathogen may be efficiently contained applying the adequate preventive measures (e.g., personal protection equipments, and disinfecting agents), indicated by national and international health authories.

    > Abstract
      This paper characterizes the relationship between occupant activities and indoor air particulate levels in a non-smoking office building. Occupant activities were recorded on video. Particulate concentrations were monitored by three optical particle counters (OPCs) in five size ranges at three heights. Particulate mass concentrations were measured gravimetrically and bioaerosol concentrations were determined by impaction methods. Occupant activities and number concentrations were determined with 1-min resolution over a 1-week period. Occupant activities such as walking past or visiting the monitoring site explained 24–55% of the variation of 1- to 25-mm diameter particle number concentrations. Statistical models associating particulate concentrations with occupant activities depended on the size fraction and included an autocorrelative term. Occupant activities are estimated to contribute up to 10 mg mª3 in particulate concentrations per person. Number concentrations of particles smaller than 1 mm had little correlation with indoor activities other than cigarette smoking and were highly correlated with outdoor levels. The method can be used to characterize emissions from activities if rapid measurements can be made and if activities can be coded from the video record.

    > Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and has since become pandemic. As part of initial response activities in the United States, enhanced contact investigations were conducted to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission.

    > Methods
      Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

    > Results
      There were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had at least 1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all known close contacts under monitoring, two additional cases were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients.

We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions.

    > Methods
      We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method.

    > Results
      Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols.

    > Conclusions
      Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.

    > Background
      An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission.

    > Methods
      We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine.

    > Results
      Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5.

    > Conclusions
      We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.

    > Background
      An epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spread of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 in Italy, which was fast and dramatic only in Lombardy and Po Valley. On March 16th 2020, we presented a Position Paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID-19 observed in Northern Italy and the peaks of particulate matter concentrations, frequently exceeding the legal limit of 50 micrograms/m3 as PM10 daily average

    > Methods
      To assess environmental factors related to the spread of the COVID-19 in Italy from February 24th to March 13th (the date when the lockdown has been imposed over Italy), official daily data relevant to ambient PM10 levels were collected from all Italian Provinces between February 9th and February 29th , taking into account the average time (estimated in 17 days) elapsed between the initial infection and the recorded COVID positivity. In addition to the number of exceedances of PM10 daily limit value, we considered also population data and daily travelling information per each Province.

    > Results
      PM10 daily limit value exceedances appear to be a significant predictor (p <0.001) of infection in univariate analyses. Less polluted Provinces had a median of 0.03 infection cases over 1000 residents, while most polluted Provinces had a median of 0.26 cases over 1000 residents. Thirty-nine out of 41 Northern Italian Provinces resulted in the category with highest PM10 levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern Provinces presented low PM10 concentrations (p<0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than Rome (0.34 vs. 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs. 2.6), suggesting a basic reproductive number R0>6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China.

Increased infection risk among children and spouses, household contacts with an immunocompromising condition, with diabetes mellitus of primary patients, and household contacts of male primary patients.

    > Background
      Although many viral respiratory illnesses are transmitted within households, the evidence base for SARS-CoV-2 is nascent. We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform strategies to reduce transmission.

    > Methods
      We recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during March 22–April 25, 2020. We interviewed patients and all household contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and odds ratios (OR) to assess risk factors for secondary infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test.

    > Results
      Thirty-two (55%) of 58 households had evidence of secondary infection among household contacts. The SIR was 29% (n = 55/188; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23–36%) overall, 42% among children (<18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33% among spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with immunocompromised conditions had increased odds of infection (OR: 15.9, 95% CI: 2.4–106.9). Household contacts who themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.2–42.5).

    > Conclusions
      We found substantial evidence of secondary infections among household contacts. People with COVID-19, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions or those with household contacts with diabetes, should take care to promptly self-isolate to prevent household transmission.

Contact with indexed patients, colleagues with infection as well as community-acquired infection were the main routes of exposure for HCWs.

    > Objectives
      To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected.

    > Results
      Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non–first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non–first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P < .001). The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non–first-line HCWs. No environmental surfaces tested positive. Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had non severe disease, while 1 (0.9%) died. The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]). Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
        In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non–first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.

    > Background
      Since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, scientific exploration of infection control is no longer restricted to microbiologists or medical scientists. Many studies have reported on the release, transport, and exposure of expiratory droplets because of respiratory activities. This review focuses on the airborne spread of infectious agents from mucus to mucus in the indoor environment and their spread as governed by airflows in the respiratory system, around people, and in buildings at different transport stages.

    > Methods
      We critically review the literature on the release of respiratory droplets, their transport and dispersion in the indoor environment, and the ultimate exposure of a susceptible host, as influenced by airflows.

    > Results
      These droplets or droplet nuclei are transported by expired airflows, which are sometimes affected by the human body plume and use of a face mask, as well as room airflow. Room airflow is affected by human activities such as walking and door opening, and some droplets are eventually captured by a susceptible individual because of his or her inspired flows; such exposure can eventually lead to long-range spread of airborne pathogens. Direct exposure to the expired fine droplets or droplet nuclei results in short-range airborne transmission. Deposition of droplets and direct personal exposure to expired large droplets can lead to the fomite route and the droplet-borne route, respectively.

    > Conclusions
      We have shown the opportunities for infection control at different stages of the spread. We propose that the short-range airborne route may be important in close contact, and its control may be achieved by face masks for the source patients and use of personalized ventilation. Our discussion of the effect of thermal stratification and expiratory delivery of droplets leads to the suggestion that displacement ventilation may not be applicable to hospital rooms where respiratory infection is a concern.

    > Abstract
      Close contact was first identified as the primary route of transmission for most respiratory infections in the early 20th century. In this review, we synthesize the existing understanding of the mechanisms of close contact transmission. We focus on two issues: the mechanism of transmission in close contact, namely the transmission of the expired particles between two people, and the physical parameters of close contact that affect the exposure of particles from one individual to another, or how the nature of close contact plays a role in transmission. We propose the existence of three sub-routes of transmission: short-range airborne, large droplets, and immediate body-surface contact. We also distinguish a "body contact," which is defined with an interpersonal distance of zero, from a close contact. We demonstrate herein that the short-range airborne sub-route may be most common. The timescales over which data should be collected to assess the transmission risk during close contact events are much shorter than those required for the distant airborne or fomite routes. The current paucity of high-resolution data over short distances and timescales makes it very difficult to assess the risk of infection in these circumstances.

      Timing of infection events, spatial relationship between workers in the meat processing plant, climate and ventilation conditions, sharing of living quarters and transport, and full viral genome sequences recovered from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were analyzed.

    > Findings
      Transmissions occurred in a confined area of a meat processing plant in which air is constantly re-circulated and cooled to 10°C. Index case B1 transmitted the virus to co-workers in a radius of more than 8 meters during work-shifts on 3 consecutive days. Assessment of viral sequences shows that all cases share a set of eight single nucleotide mutations representing a novel sub-branch in the SARS-CoV-2 C20 clade. We identified the same set of mutations in samples collected in the time period between the initial infection cluster and a subsequent outbreak in the following month, with the largest number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in a meat processing facility reported so far.

    > Abstract
      A susceptible person experiences the highest exposure risk of respiratory infection when he or she is in close proximity with an infected person. The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (<2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 μm and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 μm and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing.

    head = We explore the role of relative humidity in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus in indoor environments based on recent studies around the world.

    > Abstract
      COVID-19 disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China and spread with an astonishing rate across the world. The transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are still debated, but recent evidence strongly suggests that COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in poorly ventilated places. Some studies also suggest the higher surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SARS-CoV-1. It is also possible that small viral particles may enter into indoor environments from the various emission sources aided by environmental factors such as relative humidity, wind speed, temperature, thus representing a type of an aerosol transmission. Here, we explore the role of relative humidity in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus in indoor environments based on recent studies around the world. Humidity affects both the evaporation kinematics and particle growth. In dry indoor places i.e., less humidity (< 40% RH), the chances of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are higher than that of humid places (i.e., > 90% RH). Based on earlier studies, a relative humidity of 40–60% was found to be optimal for human health in indoor places. Thus, it is extremely important to set a minimum relative humidity standard for indoor environments such as hospitals, offices and public transports for minimization of airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2.

    > Abstract
      A novel β-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal–oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Here we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.

    > Background
      The Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020.

    > Methods
      Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among
      pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

    > Findings
      Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 - 2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since midJanuary were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 –9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2 – 23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1 - 6.4).

    head = 18 different clusters of COVID19 cases with 2–48 cases per cluster have been reported in Singapore (Medical store, hotel, restaurant, construction site, office space, church, gym). Our current findings point to temporary sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number lying below 1.02.

    > Background
      As of March 31, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in December 2019 is now generating local transmission around the world. The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued.

    > Methods
      Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts.

    > Results
      The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p < 0.001).

    > Conclusion
      The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.

      Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.

    > Methods
      The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.

    > Results
      We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.

      We report the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 across different settings from the initial COVID-19 cluster in Brunei, arisen from 19 attendees at the Malaysian Tablighi Jama′at gathering and resulted in 52 locally transmitted cases. Highest non-primary attack rates(ARs) were observed at a subsequent local religious gathering (14.8% [95%CI: 7.1,27.7]) and in the household (10.6% [95%CI: 7.3,15.1]. Household ARs of symptomatic cases were higher (14.4% [95%CI: 8.8,19.9]) than asymptomatic (4.4% [95%CI: 0.0,10.5]) or presymptomatic cases (6.1% [95%CI: 0.3,11.8]). Low ARs (<1%) were observed for workplace and social settings. Our analysis highlights that SARS-CoV-2 transmission varies depending on environmental, behavioural and host factors. We identify ′red flags′ of potential super-spreading events, namely densely populated gatherings for prolonged periods in enclosed settings, presence of individuals with recent travel history, and group behaviours such as communal eating, sleeping and sharing of personal hygiene facilities. We propose differentiated testing strategies that account for transmission risk.

Information on all recruited individuals was extracted from medical records and confirmed or supplemented by telephone interviews. The baseline characteristics of index cases and contact patients were described. Secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 to contact members were computed and the risk factors for transmission within the household were estimated.

    > Results
      Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). The secondary attack rate to children was 4% compared with 17.1% for adults. The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since onset of symptoms was 0% compared with 16.9% for contacts without quarantined index patients.

    > Abstract
      Most ventilation and air conditioning systems are designed without much concern about how settling particles behave in ventilation air flows. For displacement ventilation systems, designers normally assume that all pollutants follow the buoyant air flow into an upper zone, where they are evacuated. This is, however, not always true. Previous studies show that high concentrations of settling respirable particles can be found in the breathing zone, and that the exposure rates can be a health hazard to occupants. The emphasis here is on how ventilation systems should be designed to minimise respirable airborne particles in the breathing zone. The supply and exhaust conditions of the ventilation air flow are shown to play an important role in the control of air quality. Computer simulation programs of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) type are used. Particle concentrations, thermal conditions and modified ventilation system solutions are reported.

      The outbreak and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused an emergency in the health system worldwide. After a first development in Wuhan, China, the virus spread in other countries, with Italy registering the second highest number of cases in Europe on the 7th of April 2020 (135,586 in total). The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients’ entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed. COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.

Undeniably, although such practices help control the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent, the complete control of virus-laden droplet and aerosol transmission by such practices is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a cough-jet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible. Hence, clearly defined, science-based administrative, clinical, and physical measures are of paramount importance to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic from the world.

    > Abstract
      Restrictions on the use of public space and social distancing have been key policy measures to reduce the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 and protect public health. At the time of writing, one half of the world’s population has been asked to stay home and avoid many public places. What will be the long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public space once the restrictions have been lifted? The depth and extent of transformation is unclear, especially as it relates to the future design, use and perceptions of public space. This article aims to highlight emerging questions at the interface of COVID-19 and city design. It is possible that the COVID-19 crisis may fundamentally change our relationship with public space. In the ensuing months and years, it will be critical to study and measure these changes in order to inform urban planning and design in a post-COVID-19 world.

      Super-spreading events in an outbreak can change the nature of an epidemic. Therefore, it is useful for public health teams to determine whether an ongoing outbreak has any contribution from such events, which may be amenable to interventions. We estimated the basic reproductive number (R0) and the dispersion factor (k) from empirical data on clusters of epidemiologically linked coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. This allowed us to infer the presence or absence of super-spreading events during the early phase of these outbreaks. The relatively large values of k implied that large cluster sizes, compatible with super-spreading, were unlikely.

    > Purpose
      The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has reached pandemic proportions within an unprecedented span of time. It is controversial whether the virus can be transmitted via tears and its ocular implications have not been widely studied. In this article, the current evidence related to ocular transmission and ocular manifestations is reviewed.

    > Results
      Several mechanisms for the ocular transmission of the virus are proposed with highlight on the nasolacrimal system as a conduit between the eye and the respiratory tract, and the role of the lacrimal gland in hematogenous spread. Ocular surface manifestations such as conjunctivitis are more commonly reported.

    > Conclusion
      The exact pathophysiology of ocular transmission of the virus remains incompletely understood, although there is preliminary evidence of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in ocular secretions. The ocular tropism of the virus and its potential to cause localized ocular disease are worth considering.

    > Background
      Systematic reviews have the potential to contribute substantially to environmental health and risk assessment.

    > Objective
      This study aimed to investigate indoor air quality of environments used for physical exercise and sports practice through a systematic review.

    > Methods
      The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and was recorded in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42016036057). The search was performed using the SciELO, Science Direct, Scopus, LILACS, MEDLINE via PubMed, and SPORTDiscus databases, from their inception through April 2017. The search terms used in the databases were (air pollution” OR “air pollutants” OR “air quality”) AND (“physical exercise” OR “physical activity” OR “sport”). The results of selected studies were divided into 5 categories for analysis: monitoring of air quality in the environment according to international guidelines, indoor-to-outdoor ratio (I/O), air quality during physical exercise, impact of air quality on health, and interventions to improve indoor air quality.

    > Results
      Among 1281 studies screened, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. The monitoring of pollutants was conducted in 20 studies. CO and NO2 were the most investigated pollutants, and guidelines were discussed in most studies. The I/O ratio was investigated in 12 studies, of which 9 showed a higher concentration of some pollutants in indoor rather than outdoor environments. Among the 34 studies selected, only 7 investigated the impact of indoor air pollution on human health. The population in most of these studies consisted of hockey players.

    > Conclusion
      Most studies conducted monitoring of pollutants in indoor environments used for physical exercise and sports practice. The earliest studies were conducted in ice skating rinks and the most recent evaluated gymnasiums, fitness centers, and sports centers. The CO, particulate matter, and NO2 concentrations were the most investigated and have the longest history of investigation. These pollutants were within the limits established by guidelines in most studies. Studies that examined the association between air quality documented the adverse effects of pollution. There is a need for more studies focused on the relationship between pollution and health.

  ref 'Murphy_et_al_06_21_2008
    head = This study used an established mouse model of short-term of severe exercise training and respiratory infection to examine the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to influenza virus. The results indicates that 3 days of exhaustive exercise on a treadmill can result in an increase in susceptibility to influenza virus.

    > Abstract
      Exercise stress is associated with an increased risk for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) while moderate exercise has been associated with a decreased risk. We have shown that exercise stress can increase susceptibility (morbidity, symptom severity and mortality) to HSV-1 respiratory infection, but there is little evidence on the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to the principal etiological agents of human respiratory infections, including influenza viruses. This study examined the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to influenza virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)). Mice were assigned to one of two groups: exercise (Ex) or control (Con). Exercise consisted of a treadmill run to volitional fatigue ( approximately 120 min) performed on three consecutive days. Fifteen minutes after the last bout of exercise or rest, mice (n=20-21/group) were intranasally inoculated with a standardized dose of influenza virus (0.25 HAU). Mice were monitored daily for morbidity (time to sickness), symptom severity and mortality (time to death) for 21 days. Exercise stress was associated with an increase in susceptibility to infection (morbidity, mortality and symptom severity on days 6 and 7; P<0.05). These data from a controlled influenza virus challenge model add significantly to the growing body of evidence that severe exercise can increase susceptibility to URTI.

    head = The respiratory physiology of exercise suggests that athletes and other exercisers may experience magnified exposure to ambient air pollution.

    > Objectives
      To establish by literature survey: (a) levels at which air pollutants are considered damaging to human health and to exercisers in particular; (b) the current ambient levels experienced in the United Kingdom; (c) whether athletes are especially at risk.

    > Methods
      Six major urban air pollutants were examined: carbon monoxide (CO); nitrogen oxides (NOX); ozone (O3); particulate matter (PM10); sulphur dioxide (SO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

    > Results
      CO is detrimental to athletic performance. NO2 is of concern to human health, but outdoor levels are low. O3 poses a potentially serious risk to exercising athletes. Decrements in lung function result from exposure, and there is evidence that athletic performance may be affected. Detrimental effects may occur at low ambient levels, but there is no scientific consensus on this matter. PM10 is causing concern in the scientific community. Blood lead accumulation during exercise indicates that personal exposure to toxic compounds associated with PM10 may be magnified. Generally, outdoor ambient levels of SO2 are too low to cause a problem to the athlete, except the asthmatic athlete. The few studies on exposure of exercisers to VOCs are reviewed.

    > Conclusions
      Athletes and exercisers should avoid exercising by the road side even though levels of the more noxious air pollutants have been controlled in the United Kingdom. O3 is particularly damaging to athletes; it reaches its highest concentrations on hot bright days in rural areas.

    > Abstract
      The ultimate aim of sustainability in buildings gained an additional new dimension as the start of the year 2020 saw a rapid worldwide spread of the infectious disease caused by a coronavirus named COVID-19. There is evidence that, in addition to person to person contact, the disease transmission occurs through airborne droplets/aerosols generated by breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. For that reason, building heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems can play an important role, as they may both contribute as well as reduce the transmission risk. However, there is insufficient understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings. This article introduces a method of bottom-up emergent modelling of the movement of infectious aerosols in internal space using a physics engine, and reports on simple simulation experiments. The results show that the smallest droplets that are large enough to contain the virus can be suspended in the air for an extended period of time; that turbulent air flow can contribute to the infectious aerosols remaining in the room; and that unidirectional air flow can contribute to purging the room of the infectious aerosols. The model introduced in this article is a starting point for further development and for increasing our understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings, and thus for increased sustainability of building design.

    > Abstract
      Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19. Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content. Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.

    head = Our finding has confirmed the aerosol transmission as an important pathway for surface contamination. Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

    > Background
      The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.

    > Methods
      Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.

    > Results
      The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.

    > Conclusions
      Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

    head = Based on the theoretical knowledge from computational fluid dynamics, aerosol science and ventilation inbuilt environment technology, we wish to draw the hypothesis to Middle Eastern countries that PM emissions due to indoor burning of incense, poor building ventilation and low indoor temperature may increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

    > Abstract
      Majority of countries across the globe have employed improving building ventilation, quarantine, social distancing, and disinfections as a general measure of preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions. However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM10; aerodynamic diameter <10 μm) and fine (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments. In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings. It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.

      With the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal, state, county, and city governments, universities, school districts, places of worship, prisons, health care facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares, homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission through built environment (BE)-mediated pathways. Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.

    > Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world. In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.

  ref 'Leclerc_et_al_06_05_2020
    head =  We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics.

    > Background
      Concern about the health impact of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in widespread enforced reductions in people’s movement (“lockdowns”). However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these “exit strategies” entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures.

    > Methods
      We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database.

    > Results
      We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe.

    > Conclusions
      We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.

    quote !o = We found that clusters of cases were reported in many, predominantly indoor settings (such as hospitals and elderly care, large religious gatherings, food processing plants, schools, shopping, and worker dormitories, prisons and ships, weddings, sport, bar). The majority of our reports are from China and Singapore.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !a = Large clusters, such as those linked to churches and ships, were infrequently reported. Almost all clusters involved fewer than 100 cases (181/201), with the outliers being transmission in hospitals, elderly care, worker dormitories, food processing plants, prisons, schools, shopping and ship settings. Religious venues provided a further setting with large cluster sizes: there were separate clusters in South Korea, France, India and Malaysia

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !b = In addition to these settings with maximum cluster sizes of more than 100 cases per cluster, we identified five further settings with maximum cluster sizes between 50 and 100: sport (65 cases) (Korean Centre for Diease Control & Prevention, 2020), bar (80 cases) (Sim, 2020), wedding (98 cases) (Ministry of Health – New Zealand, 2020), work (97 cases) (Park et al., 2020) and conference (89 cases) (Marcelo & O'brien, 2020).

    # quote !c = We found a notably high number of transmission events reported in worker dormitories (21/201), although all of these were from Singapore. This type of setting had the second highest total cluster size out of all the recorded events we found, with 797 cases reported in the S11 dormitory cluster in Singapore (Data Against COVID19 SG, 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !d = We found only a small number of clusters linked to schools (8/201), and there the SARS-CoV-2 cases reported were most often in teachers or other staff. For example, for two school clusters in Singapore (Ministry of Health - Singapore, 2020), 16/26 and 7/8 cases were staff. Some children were also found to be infected in these clusters, as was the case in the Salanter Akiba Riverdale school in New York, USA (Ailworth & Berzon (2020)), although testing for infection was not always universal. In a retrospective close cohort study in a French high school however, 133 children and staff were seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 92 of whom were pupils (Fontanet et al., 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !e = We identified 9 clusters linked to food processing plants in 4 different countries (USA, Germany, Canada, Netherlands). These transmission events have led to large clusters, such as in a meat processing plant in South Dakota where a total of 518 employees were infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Cannon, 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !f = The setting with the greatest number of reported clusters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was households (36/201). Again, most were from China (25/36) with all cluster sizes being less than 10. However, for 27 out of 36 studies, we were unable to calculate either the secondary or final attack rates due to a lack of information on total household size.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !g = One type of setting that was associated with large numbers of eventual cases was religious venues. The common features of these meetings are the large number of attendees, confined spaces and physical contact. For example, there were eventually more than 5000 COVID-19 cases linked to transmission at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in South Korea (Shin et al., 2020). In this particular religious venue, no preventative action was taken despite knowing members were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In other venues, transmission events took place without prior knowledge of any infections and before the WHO declared pandemic status.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !h = Other large clusters in this setting type were associated with annual religious events that took place over a few days or weeks (Ananthalakshmi & Sipalan, 2020; BBC, 2020; Salaün, 2020). Attendees returned to their home countries where they continued to transmit. This generated many secondary cases internationally as well as locally.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !i = However, it is clear from smaller “first-generation” clusters, which our analysis focuses on, that these settings provide ideal conditions for transmission: we found 7/16 identified religious clusters had 10 cases or less, whilst 9/16 had 23 or more. The number of cases in each cluster is an approximation, and little is known about the number of index cases in these religious meetings to begin with, with the exception of the South Korea cluster. Religious events are well known sources of heightened transmission; there is a focus on vaccination recommendations for attendees to the annual Hajj pilgrimage for example, which is currently being postponed for 2020.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !j = Worker dormitories have been recognised as key places linked to transmission in Singapore, with 893 out of 942 new cases recorded on April 18th being residents in such dormitories (Asia, 2020). We found 21 reported clusters, one of which had the second largest cluster size of all the events we report here; 797 cases which from the data we believe is a first-generation cluster

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !k = These points also apply to prisons, another type of large co-habiting setting for which we have identified 4 clusters with a maximum cluster size of 353 cases.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !l = In addition to religious events and worker homes, we also identified clusters of more than 100 cases in elderly care homes, hospitals and ships.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !m = We identified seven additional setting types with cluster sizes above 50 or 100 cases (school, sport, bar, shopping, wedding, work and conference), which shared characteristics with the settings described above. Notably, sport, bars, shopping areas and conferences are predominantly indoor settings, where people are in close proximity. For conferences and work, like religious events, transmission within the cluster is facilitated by the duration of the events over several days, as well as the combination of interactions there (workshops, dinners etc…).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    quote !n = This can also apply to weddings, where transmission is further increased due to the close-proximity interactions between people (kissing, hugging, dancing etc…). As for bars and shopping areas, these are places with important fluxes of people, which increases the diversity of contacts. Finally, schools, like religious groups, can sometimes represent tightly knit communities which facilitates disease transmission amongst individuals, as was the case with the Salanter Akiba Riverdale school in New York, with a cluster size of at least 60 cases

    > Abstract
      This paper introduces a numerical simulation model for investigating the influence of moving subjects on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets, rather than on the dispersion of surrogate gaseous counterparts generally adopted in related research works. In our work, the Lagrangian discrete trajectory model is used for tracing the motion of droplets, the Eulerian RANS method is used for solving the airflow field, and the dynamic mesh model for describing the human movement. The model validation was performed through result comparisons with published data from literatures. A case study on the influence of human walking on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) is then presented. Our findings show that the human walking disturbs the local velocity field with wake formation. The increase of walking speed could effectively reduce the overall number of suspended droplets, which may have a positive impact on releasing the infection risk of health workers in AIIR.

    > Abstract
      After the emergence of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), many exposure and environmental health scientists promptly recognized the potentially catastrophic public health ramifications of concurrent infectious and air pollution-mediated disease. Nevertheless, much of this attention has been focused on outdoor interactions. Each year, 3.8 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to indoor air. Hence, poor household indoor air quality is a long-standing public health issue with even greater relevance now that many individuals are spending more time at home. At present, the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate indoor air, and state-level legislation has resulted in a patchwork of national coverage. Here, we describe common sources of indoor air pollution, the health impacts of indoor pollutants, and populations disparately impacted by COVID-19 and poor indoor air quality. Furthermore, we detail the need for better legislation that promotes the integrity of the indoor air environment, and what individuals can do to personally protect themselves as we await more comprehensive indoor air legislation.

      The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019, and its resulting coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 represents perhaps the most significant public health emergency in a century. As the pandemic progressed, a continued paucity of evidence on routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has resulted in shifting infection prevention and control guidelines between classically-defined airborne and droplet precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, we collected air and surface samples to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. We detected viral contamination among all samples, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients.

    > Abstract
      Since December 2019, COVID-19, a new emerging infection disease, has spread in 27 countries and regions. The clusters of many cases were reported with the epidemic progresses. We collected currently available information for 377 COVID-19 clusters (1 719 cases), excluded the hospital clusters and Hubei cases, during the period from January 1 to February 20, 2020. There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median was 4; 39 clusters of dining (10%), case median was 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case median was 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median was 6, and 6 clusters of transportation. We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and its range was 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days. The analysis of the epidemic situation in a department store in China indicated that there was a possibility of patients as the source of infection during the incubation period of the epidemic. From February 5 to 21, 2020, 634 persons were infected on the Diamond Princess Liner. All persons are susceptible to the 2019 coronavirus. Age, patients during the incubation period and the worse environment might be the cause of the cases rising. The progress of the two typical outbreaks clearly demonstrated the spread of the early cases in Wuhan. In conclusion, screening and isolating close contacts remained essential other than clinical treatment during the epidemic. Especially for the healthy people in the epidemic area, isolation was the key.

    > Methods
      Eighty-eight cases of laboratory-confirmed and three cases of clinically confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020.

    > Results and discussion
      Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2, three (3.30%) cases were clinically diagnosed. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5–57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample, 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the disease from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, eight (8.79%) patients had contacted with people from Wuhan, and 11 (12.09%) patients were diagnosed after having flown together in the same flight with no passenger that could later be identified as the source of infection. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (interquartile range 3–8) days and the median time from the first visit to a doctor to the confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1–2) days. According to the chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.

    > Abstract
      Commissioned by the Minister of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan, we collected secondary transmission data with the aim of identifying high risk transmission settings. We show that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environments are consistent with large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital-associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease. Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help prevent large case clusters and superspreading events.

    > Abstract
      Over 1 billion people currently live in slums, with the number of slum dwellers only expected to grow in the coming decades. The vast majority of slums are located in and around urban centres in the less economically developed countries, which are also experiencing greater rates of urbanization compared with more developed countries. This rapid rate of urbanization is cause for significant concern given that many of these countries often lack the ability to provide the infrastructure (e.g., roads and affordable housing) and basic services (e.g., water and sanitation) to provide adequately for the increasing influx of people into cities. While research on slums has been ongoing, such work has mainly focused on one of three constructs: exploring the socio-economic and policy issues; exploring the physical characteristics; and, lastly, those modelling slums. This paper reviews these lines of research and argues that while each is valuable, there is a need for a more holistic approach for studying slums to truly understand them. By synthesizing the social and physical constructs, this paper provides a more holistic synthesis of the problem, which can potentially lead to a deeper understanding and, consequently, better approaches for tackling the challenge of slums at the local, national and regional scales.

  ref 'Riley_et_al_03_07_2007
    head = Continued neglect of ever-expanding urban slum populations could inevitably lead to greater expenditure and diversion of health care resources to the management of end-stage complications of diseases that are preventable.

    > Background
      Urban slums, like refugee communities, comprise a social cluster that engenders a distinct set of health problems. With 1 billion people currently estimated to live in such communities, this neglected population has become a major reservoir for a wide spectrum of health conditions that the formal health sector must deal with.

    > Discussion
      Unlike what occurs with refugee populations, the formal health sector becomes aware of the health problems of slum populations relatively late in the course of their illnesses. As such, the formal health sector inevitably deals with the severe and end-stage complications of these diseases at a substantially greater cost than what it costs to manage non-slum community populations. Because of the informal nature of slum settlements, and cultural, social, and behavioral factors unique to the slum populations, little is known about the spectrum, burden, and determinants of illnesses in these communities that give rise to these complications, especially of those diseases that are chronic but preventable. In this article, we discuss observations made in one slum community of 58,000 people in Salvador, the third largest city in Brazil, to highlight the existence of a spectrum and burden of chronic illnesses not likely to be detected by the formal sector health services until they result in complications or death. Lack of health-related data from slums could lead to inappropriate and unrealistic allocation of health care resources by the public and private providers. Similar misassumptions and misallocations are likely to exist in other nations with large urban slum populations.

    > Summary
      Continued neglect of ever-expanding urban slum populations in the world could inevitably lead to greater expenditure and diversion of health care resources to the management of end-stage complications of diseases that are preventable. A new approach to health assessment and characterization of social-cluster determinants of health in urban slums is urgently needed.

    > Abstract
      The informal settlements of the Global South are the least prepared for the pandemic of COVID-19 since basic needs such as water, toilets, sewers, drainage, waste collection, and secure and adequate housing are already in short supply or non-existent. Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.

    > Purpose of Review
      Mass gatherings (MGs) are characterized by a high concentration of people at a specific time and location. Infectious diseases are of particular concern at MGs. The aim of this review was to summarize findings in the field of infectious diseases with a variety of pathogens associated with international MGs in the last 5 years.

    > Recent Findings
      In the context of Hajj, one of the largest religious MGs at Mecca, Saudi Arabia, respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of infectious diseases in pilgrims with a prevalence of 50–93%. The most commonly acquired respiratory viruses were human rhinovirus, followed by human coronaviruses and influenza A virus, in decreasing order. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria. The prevalence of Hajj-related diarrhea ranged from 1.1 to 23.3% and etiologies included Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli, with evidence of acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In other MGs such as Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, sports events, and large-scale open-air festivals, outbreaks have been reported less frequently. The most common outbreaks at these events involved diseases preventable by vaccination, notably measles and influenza. Gastrointestinal infections caused by a variety of pathogens were also recorded.

    > Summary
      Because social distancing and contact avoidance are difficult measures to implement in the context of many MGs, individual preventive measures including vaccination, use of face mask, disposable handkerchief and hand hygiene may be recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures has been poorly investigated in the context of MGs.

    > Abstract
      From January 1993 through February 1995, CDC and state health departments completed investigations of six instances in which passengers or flight crew traveled on commercial aircraft while infectious with tuberculosis (TB). All six of these investigations involved symptomatic TB patients with acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive cavitary pulmonary TB, who were highly infectious at the time of the flight(s). In two instances, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from the index patients was resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; organisms isolated from other cases were susceptible to all antituberculous medications. In addition, in two instances, the index patients were aware of their TB at the time of travel and were in transit to the United States to obtain medical care. However, in none of six instances were the airlines aware of the TB in these passengers. This report summarizes the investigations by CDC and state health departments and provides guidance about notification of passengers and flight crew if an exposure to TB occurs during travel on commercial aircraft.

    > BACKGROUND
      In April 1994, a passenger with infectious multidrug-resistant tuberculosis traveled on commercial-airline flights from Honolulu to Chicago and from Chicago to Baltimore and returned one month later. We sought to determine whether she had infected any of her contacts on this extensive trip.

    > METHODS
      Passengers and crew were identified from airline records and were notified of their exposure, asked to complete a questionnaire, and screened by tuberculin skin tests.

    > RESULTS
      Of the 925 people on the airplanes, 802 (86.7 percent) responded. All 11 contacts with positive tuberculin skin tests who were on the April flights and 2 of 3 contacts with positive tests who were on the Baltimore-to-Chicago flight in May had other risk factors for tuberculosis. More contacts on the final, 8.75-hour flight from Chicago to Honolulu had positive skin tests than those on the other three flights (6 percent, as compared with 2.3, 3.8, and 2.8 percent). Of 15 contacts with positive tests on the May flight from Chicago to Honolulu, 6 (4 with skin-test conversions) had no other risk factors; all 6 had sat in the same section of the plane as the index patient (P = 0.001). Passengers seated within two rows of the index patient were more likely to have positive tuberculin skin tests than those in the rest of the section (4 of 13, or 30.8 percent, vs. 2 of 55, or 3.6 percent; rate ratio, 8.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 41.3; P = 0.01).

    > BACKGROUND
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.

    > METHODS
      We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.

    > RESULTS
      After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

    > Abstract
      This study aimed to analyze the risk of infection (influenza and tuberculosis) for individuals participating in physical exercise. This was achieved by assessment of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and examination of the physical characteristics of a number of gyms to determine whether there was a relationship to CO2 levels. This study was performed in three different gyms ventilated with either split system or central system air conditioners. The risk of airborne infection (percent of susceptible persons infected) was estimated for each gym using the Wells-Riley model. The risk of infection increased during periods of peak occupancy where the ventilation required by occupants was greater. In each gym, the highest risk of infection occurred during the evening where occupancy and CO2 levels were high. The infection risk for influenza was high in all situations due to the high quantum generation rate for this agent. This study suggests that inefficient ventilation in gyms is a significant problem, with high CO2 concentrations resulting in impaired air quality and high health risks to users, including increased risk of infections such as influenza and tuberculosis.

    > Abstract
      We analyzed 3,184 cases of coronavirus disease in Japan and identified 61 case-clusters in healthcare and other care facilities, restaurants and bars, workplaces, and music events. We also identified 22 probable primary case-patients for the clusters; most were 20–39 years of age and presymptomatic or asymptomatic at virus transmission.
