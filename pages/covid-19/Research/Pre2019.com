  // Vitamin D controls T cell antigen receptor signaling and activation of human T cells
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1851
  ref 'Essen_et_al_03_07_2010
    head = Human T cells had very low expression of PLC-gamma1 and that this correlated with low T cell antigen receptor (TCR) responsiveness in naive T cells. TCR signaling via p38 leads to successive induction of VDR (vitamin D receptor) and PLC-gamma1, which are required for subsequent classical TCR signaling and T cell activation.

    > Abstract
      Phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes are key signaling proteins downstream of many extracellular stimuli. Here we show that naive human T cells had very low expression of PLC-gamma1 and that this correlated with low T cell antigen receptor (TCR) responsiveness in naive T cells. However, TCR triggering led to an upregulation of approximately 75-fold in PLC-gamma1 expression, which correlated with greater TCR responsiveness. Induction of PLC-gamma1 was dependent on vitamin D and expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Naive T cells did not express VDR, but VDR expression was induced by TCR signaling via the alternative mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway. Thus, initial TCR signaling via p38 leads to successive induction of VDR and PLC-gamma1, which are required for subsequent classical TCR signaling and T cell activation.

  # Cloth Mask vs Surgical Mask

    > Abstract
      Inexpensive cloth masks are widely used in developing countries to protect from particulate pollution albeit limited data on their efficacy exists. This study examined the efficiency of four types of masks (three types of cloth masks and one type of surgical mask) commonly worn in the developing world. Five monodispersed aerosol sphere size (30, 100, and 500 nm, and 1 and 2.5 μm) and diluted whole diesel exhaust was used to assess facemask performance. Among the three cloth mask types, a cloth mask with an exhaust valve performed best with filtration efficiency of 80–90% for the measured polystyrene latex (PSL) particle sizes. Two styles of commercially available fabric masks were the least effective with a filtration efficiency of 39–65% for PSL particles, and they performed better as the particle size increased. When the cloth masks were tested against lab-generated whole diesel particles, the filtration efficiency for three particle sizes (30, 100, and 500 nm) ranged from 15% to 57%. Standard N95 mask performance was used as a control to compare the results with cloth masks, and our results suggest that cloth masks are only marginally beneficial in protecting individuals from particles<2.5 μm. Compared with cloth masks, disposable surgical masks are more effective in reducing particulate exposure.

  #  Face masks, children, efficacy
  // Smaller facemasks for positive pressure ventilation in preterm infants: A randomised trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.12.005
  ref 'O'Currain_et_al_12_17_2018
    head = Smaller facemasks did not reduce mask leak in preterm facemask ventilation. All facemasks had high leak, particularly in infants ≤26 weeks’ gestation.

    > Aim
      Facial measurements of preterm infants indicate that standard diameter facemasks used during positive pressure ventilation are too large, which may lead to mask leak and compromise resuscitation. We aimed to determine whether the use of a facemask that better complies with the dimensions of preterm faces, compared with a standard facemask, reduces facemask leak.

    > Methods
      Parallel group, randomised controlled trial. Preterm infants ≤32 weeks’ gestation receiving facemask ventilation prior to intubation in the neonatal intensive care unit, and those 28–32+6 weeks’ receiving facemask ventilation in the delivery room were eligible. Infants were randomised to receive ventilation via a standard (50 mm) (control), or a smaller (35 mm or 42 mm) diameter facemask (intervention), stratified by gestation (≤26 weeks’; 35 mm, 27–32+6; 42 mm). The primary outcome was leak between the mask and the infants face.

    > Results
      Of 298 eligible infants, 139 were randomised and 131 were included in the final analysis; 66 in the intervention group and 65 in the control group. The median (IQR) leak was 42% (13–69%) in the intervention group compared with 39% (22–66%) in the control group P = 0.43. The median (IQR) lowest oxygen saturation was similar in both groups [intervention 70% (34–93%) vs. control 71% (40–93%) P = 0.75]. One infant crossed over from the intervention to the control group due to poor response to ventilation with the intervention facemask.

    >  Conclusions
      Smaller facemasks did not reduce mask leak in preterm facemask ventilation. All facemasks had high leak, particularly in infants ≤26 weeks’ gestation.

  ref 'Quan_et_al_01_04_2017
    head = We report the development of a universal, reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the main fibrous filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium chloride salt. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses.

    > Abstract
      Aerosolized pathogens are a leading cause of respiratory infection and transmission. Currently used protective measures pose potential risk of primary/secondary infection and transmission. Here, we report the development of a universal, reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the main fibrous filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium chloride salt. The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer, and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh environmental conditions. Our results can be applied in obtaining a broad-spectrum, airborne pathogen prevention device in preparation for epidemic and pandemic of respiratory diseases.

  doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002618
  ref 'Sande_et_al_07_09_2008
    head = Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection. Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission.

    > Background
      Governments are preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. Therefore they need data to assess the possible impact of interventions. Face-masks worn by the general population could be an accessible and affordable intervention, if effective when worn under routine circumstances.

    > Methodology
      We assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators, surgical masks and home-made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient.

    > Principal Findings
      All types of masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable over time, unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity, but with a high degree of individual variation. Personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. Regardless of mask type, children were less well protected. Outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers).

    > Conclusions/Significance
      Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection. Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission.

  ref 'Wood_et_al_10_23_2016
    head = Four- to seven-day exposures to low levels of HPV (hydrogen peroxide Vapour) were effective in inactivating B. anthracis spores on multiple materials.

    > Aims:
      To evaluate the use of relatively low levels of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) for the inactivation of Bacillus anthracis spores within an indoor environment.

    > Methods and Results:
      Laboratory-scale decontamination tests were conducted using bacterial spores of both B. anthracis Ames and Bacillus atrophaeus inoculated onto several types of materials. Pilot-scale tests were also conducted using a larger chamber furnished as an indoor office. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) humidifiers filled with aqueous solutions of 3 or 8% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were used to generate the HPV inside the mock office. The spores were exposed to HPV for periods ranging from 8 h up to 1 week.

    > Conclusions:
      Four- to seven-day exposures to low levels of HPV (average air concentrations of approx. 5–10 parts per million) were effective in inactivating B. anthracis spores on multiple materials. The HPV can be generated with COTS humidifiers and household H2O2 solutions. With the exception of one test/material, B. atrophaeus spores were equally or more resistant to HPV inactivation compared to those from B. anthracis Ames.

    > Objective
      This study examined homemade masks as an alternative to commercial face masks.

    > Methods
      Several household materials were evaluated for the capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols. Twenty-one healthy volunteers made their own face masks from cotton t-shirts; the masks were then tested for fit. The number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask, a surgical mask, or no mask was compared using several air-sampling techniques.

    > Results
      The median-fit factor of the homemade masks was one-half that of the surgical masks. Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers, although the surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask.

    > Conclusion
      Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.

  ref 'Zhang_et_al_02_20_2008
    head = The present study analyzed the similarities and differences of transport and dispersion between the gaseous and particulate contaminants. The sub-micron-sized heavy particles behaved like the passive gas contaminant in the cabin except in the region near the source position because the diffusivity can be different.

    > Abstract
      The study of airflow and contaminant transport in airliner cabins is very important for creating a comfortable and healthy environment. This paper shows the results of such a study by conducting experimental measurements and numerical simulations of airflow and contaminant transport in a section of half occupied, twin-aisle cabin mockup. The air velocity and air temperature were measured by ultrasonic and omni-directional anemometers. A gaseous contaminant was simulated by a tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride or SF6, and measured by a photo-acoustic multi-gas analyzer. A particulate contaminant was simulated by 0.7 μm di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacat (DEHS) particles and measured by an optical particle sizer. The numerical simulations used the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations based on the RNG k–ε model to solve the air velocity, air temperature, and gas contaminant concentration; and employed a Lagrangian method to model the particle transport. The numerical results quantitatively agreed with the experimental data while some remarkable differences exist in airflow distributions. Both the experimental measurements and computer simulations were not free from errors. A complete and accurate validation for a complicated cabin environment is challenging and difficult.

    > Abstract
      The transport and deposition of polydispersed expiratory aerosols in an aircraft cabin were simulated using a Lagrangian-based model validated by experiments conducted in an aircraft cabin mockup. Infection risk by inhalation was estimated using the aerosol dispersion data and a model was developed to estimate the risk of infection by contact. The environmental control system (ECS) in a cabin creates air circulation mainly in the lateral direction, making lateral dispersions of aerosols much faster than longitudinal dispersions. Aerosols with initial sizes under 28 μm in diameter can stay airborne for comparatively long periods and are favorable for airborne transport. Using influenza data as an example, the estimated risk of infection by inhalation are at least two orders of magnitude higher than the risk of infection by contact. An increase in the supply airflow rate enhances ventilation removal and the dispersion of these aerosols. It reduces the risk of infection by inhalation for passengers seated within one row and one column from the index patient but it increases the risk for passengers seated further away. The deposition fraction increases with aerosol size. The ECS supply airflow rate has insignificant impact on the deposition behavior of these large aerosols, making the impact on the risk of infection by contact insignificant. Comparatively, the contact behavior of passengers is highly influential to the contact infection risk. Passengers seated within one row from the index patient are subject to contact risks that are one to two orders of magnitude higher than are passengers seated further away.

    > Background
      Recent studies suggest that humans exhale fine particles during tidal breathing but little is known of their composition, particularly during infection.

    > Methodology/principal findings
      We conducted a study of influenza infected patients to characterize influenza virus and particle concentrations in their exhaled breath. Patients presenting with influenza-like-illness, confirmed influenza A or B virus by rapid test, and onset within 3 days were recruited at three clinics in Hong Kong, China. We collected exhaled breath from each subject onto Teflon filters and measured exhaled particle concentrations using an optical particle counter. Filters were analyzed for influenza A and B viruses by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Twelve out of thirteen rapid test positive patients provided exhaled breath filter samples (7 subjects infected with influenza B virus and 5 subjects infected with influenza A virus). We detected influenza virus RNA in the exhaled breath of 4 (33%) subjects--three (60%) of the five patients infected with influenza A virus and one (14%) of the seven infected with influenza B virus. Exhaled influenza virus RNA generation rates ranged from <3.2 to 20 influenza virus RNA particles per minute. Over 87% of particles exhaled were under 1 microm in diameter.

    > Conclusions
      These findings regarding influenza virus RNA suggest that influenza virus may be contained in fine particles generated during tidal breathing, and add to the body of literature suggesting that fine particle aerosols may play a role in influenza transmission.

    > Abstract
      A new expiratory droplet investigation system (EDIS) was used to conduct the most comprehensive program of study to date, of the dilution corrected droplet size distributions produced during different respiratory activities.
      Distinct physiological processes were responsible for specific size distribution modes. The majority of particles for all activities were produced in one or more modes, with diameters below 0.8 μm at average concentrations up to 0.75 cm−3. These particles occurred at varying concentrations, during all respiratory activities, including normal breathing. A second mode at 1.8 μm was produced during all activities, but at lower concentrations of up to 0.14 cm−3.
      Speech produced additional particles in modes near 3.5 and 5 μm. These two modes became most pronounced during sustained vocalization, producing average concentrations of 0.04 and 0.16 cm−3, respectively, suggesting that the aerosolization of secretions lubricating the vocal chords is a major source of droplets in terms of number.
      For the entire size range examined of 0.3–20 μm, average particle number concentrations produced during exhalation ranged from 0.1 cm−3 for breathing to 1.1 cm−3 for sustained vocalization.
      Non-equilibrium droplet evaporation was not detectable for particles between 0.5 and 20 μm, implying that evaporation to the equilibrium droplet size occurred within 0.8 s.

      Droplets carried in exhaled breath may carry microorganisms capable of transmitting disease over both short and long distances. The size distribution of such droplets will influence the type of organisms that may be carried as well as strategies for controlling airborne infection. The aim of this study was to characterize the size distribution of droplets exhaled by healthy individuals. Exhaled droplets from human subjects performing four respiratory actions (mouth breathing, nose breathing, coughing, talking) were measured by both an optical particle counter (OPC) and an analytical transmission electron microscope (AEM). The OPC indicated a preponderance of particles less than 1 μ, although larger particles were also found. Measurements with the AEM confirmed the existence of larger sized droplets in the exhaled breath. In general, coughing produced the largest droplet concentrations and nose breathing the least, although considerable intersubject variability was observed.

  ref 'Yu_et_al_04_22_2004
    head = Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.

    > BACKGROUND
      There is uncertainty about the mode of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of cases in a large community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and examined the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume that was modeled using studies of airflow dynamics.

    > METHODS
      We determined the distribution of the initial 187 cases of SARS in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003 according to the date of onset and location of residence. We then studied the association between the location (building, floor, and direction the apartment unit faced) and the probability of infection using logistic regression. The spread of the airborne, virus-laden aerosols generated by the index patient was modeled with the use of airflow-dynamics studies, including studies performed with the use of computational fluid-dynamics and multizone modeling.

    > RESULTS
      The curves of the epidemic suggested a common source of the outbreak. All but 5 patients lived in seven buildings (A to G), and the index patient and more than half the other patients with SARS (99 patients) lived in building E. Residents of the floors at the middle and upper levels in building E were at a significantly higher risk than residents on lower floors; this finding is consistent with a rising plume of contaminated warm air in the air shaft generated from a middle-level apartment unit. The risks for the different units matched the virus concentrations predicted with the use of multizone modeling. The distribution of risk in buildings B, C, and D corresponded well with the three-dimensional spread of virus-laden aerosols predicted with the use of computational fluid-dynamics modeling.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.

    > Abstract
      The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted both short- and long-range transmission routes, i.e. between infected patients and healthcare workers, and between distant locations. With other infections such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox, the concept of aerosol transmission is so well accepted that isolation of such patients is the norm. With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of transmission via infectious air has become more important. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the factors involved in: (1) the generation of an infectious aerosol, (2) the transmission of infectious droplets or droplet nuclei from this aerosol, and (3) the potential for inhalation of such droplets or droplet nuclei by a susceptible host. On this basis, recommendations are made to improve the control of aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals as well as in the design and construction of future isolation facilities.

      We studied transmission patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among medical students exposed exclusively to the first SARS patient in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, before his illness was recognized. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 66 medical students who visited the index patient’s ward, including 16 students with SARS and 50 healthy students. The risk of contracting SARS was sevenfold greater among students who definitely visited the index case’s cubicle than in those who did not (10/27 [41%] versus 1/20 [5%], relative risk [RR] 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 53.3). Illness rates increased directly with proximity of exposure to the index case. However, four of eight students who were in the same cubicle, but were not within 1 m of the index case-patient, contracted SARS. Proximity to the index case-patient was associated with transmission, which is consistent with droplet spread. Transmission through fomites or small aerosols cannot be ruled out.

    > Background
      The largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015 and resulted in 186 laboratory-confirmed infections, including 36 (19%) deaths. Some hospitals were considered epicenters of infection and voluntarily shut down most of their operations after nearly half of all transmissions occurred in hospital settings. However, the ways that MERS-CoV is transmitted in healthcare settings are not well defined.

    > Methods
      We explored the possible contribution of contaminated hospital air and surfaces to MERS transmission by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces in 2 hospitals treating MERS-CoV patients. The samples were tested by viral culture with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using MERS-CoV Spike antibody, and electron microscopy (EM).

    > Results
      The presence of MERS-CoV was confirmed by RT-PCR of viral cultures of 4 of 7 air samples from 2 patients' rooms, 1 patient's restroom, and 1 common corridor. In addition, MERS-CoV was detected in 15 of 68 surface swabs by viral cultures. IFA on the cultures of the air and swab samples revealed the presence of MERS-CoV. EM images also revealed intact particles of MERS-CoV in viral cultures of the air and swab samples.

    > Conclusions
      These data provide experimental evidence for extensive viable MERS-CoV contamination of the air and surrounding materials in MERS outbreak units. Thus, our findings call for epidemiologic investigation of the possible scenarios for contact and airborne transmission, and raise concern regarding the adequacy of current infection control procedures.

    > Abstract
      Violent respiratory events such as coughs and sneezes play a key role in transferring respiratory diseases between infectious and susceptible individuals. We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the fluid dynamics of such violent expiratory events. Direct observation of sneezing and coughing events reveals that such flows are multiphase turbulent buoyant clouds with suspended droplets of various sizes. Our observations guide the development of an accompanying theoretical model of pathogen-bearing droplets interacting with a turbulent buoyant momentum puff. We develop in turn discrete and continuous models of droplet fallout from the cloud in order to predict the range of pathogens. According to the discrete fallout model droplets remain suspended in the cloud until their settling speed matches that of the decelerating cloud. A continuous fallout model is developed by adapting models of sedimentation from turbulent fluids. The predictions of our theoretical models are tested against data gathered from a series of analogue experiments in which a particle-laden cloud is ejected into a relatively dense ambient. Our study highlights the importance of the multiphase nature of respiratory clouds, specifically the suspension of the smallest drops by circulation within the cloud, in extending the range of respiratory pathogens.

    > Abstract
      Assessment of the risks posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on surfaces requires data on survival of this virus on environmental surfaces and on how survival is affected by environmental variables, such as air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH). The use of surrogate viruses has the potential to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV and to increase the available data on coronavirus survival on surfaces. Two potential surrogates were evaluated in this study; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were used to determine effects of AT and RH on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel. At 4 degrees C, infectious virus persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% RH. Inactivation was more rapid at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C at all humidity levels; the viruses persisted for 5 to 28 days, and the slowest inactivation occurred at low RH. Both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The relationship between inactivation and RH was not monotonic, and there was greater survival or a greater protective effect at low RH (20%) and high RH (80%) than at moderate RH (50%). There was also evidence of an interaction between AT and RH. The results show that when high numbers of viruses are deposited, TGEV and MHV may survive for days on surfaces at ATs and RHs typical of indoor environments. TGEV and MHV could serve as conservative surrogates for modeling exposure, the risk of transmission, and control measures for pathogenic enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV and influenza virus, on health care surfaces.

    > Abstract
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial drug used as chemoprophylaxis against malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA). In this study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of HCQ and its metabolites and the relationship between the PK of HCQ and the effect of treatment of HCQ on vivax malaria in South Koreans. Three PK studies of HCQ were conducted with 91 healthy subjects and patients with vivax malaria. Plasma concentrations were analyzed by noncompartmental and mixed-effect modeling approaches. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption best described the data. The clearance and the central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 15.5 liters/h, 733 liters, and 1,630 liters, respectively. We measured the plasma concentrations of HCQ in patients with prophylactic failure of HCQ and compared them with the prediction intervals of the simulated concentrations for HCQ from the final PK model built in this study. In 71% of the patients with prophylactic failure, the plasma concentrations of HCQ were below the lower bounds of the 95% prediction interval, while only 8% of them showed higher levels than the upper bounds of the 95% prediction interval. We report that a significant cause of prophylactic failure among the individuals in ROKA was ascribed to plasma concentrations of HCQ lower than those predicted by the PK model. However, prophylactic failure despite sufficient plasma concentrations of HCQ was confirmed in several individuals, warranting continued surveillance to monitor changes in the HCQ susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax in the Republic of Korea.

    > Abstract
      This paper presents the current state of knowledge on chloroquine disposition, with special emphasis on stereoselectivity and microsomal metabolism. In addition, the impact of the patient's physiopathological status and ethnic origin on chloroquine pharmacokinetics is discussed. In humans, chloroquine concentrations decline multiexponentially. The drug is extensively distributed, with a volume of distribution of 200 to 800 L/kg when calculated from plasma concentrations and 200 L/kg when estimated from whole blood data (concentrations being 5 to 10 times higher). Chloroquine is 60% bound to plasma proteins and equally cleared by the kidney and liver. Following administration chloroquine is rapidly dealkylated via cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) into the pharmacologically active desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine. Desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine concentrations reach 40 and 10% of chloroquine concentrations, respectively; both chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentrations decline slowly, with elimination half-lives of 20 to 60 days. Both parent drug and metabolite can be detected in urine months after a single dose. In vitro and in vivo, chloroquine and desethylchloroquine competitively inhibit CYP2D1/6-mediated reactions. Limited in vitro studies and preliminary data from clinical experiments and observations point to CYP3A and CYP2D6 as the 2 major isoforms affected by or involved in chloroquine metabolism. In vitro efficacy studies did not detect any difference in potency between chloroquine enantiomers but, in vivo in rats, S(+)-chloroquine had a lower dose that elicited 50% of the maximal effect (ED950) than that of R(-)-chloroquine. Stereoselectivity in chloroquine body disposition could be responsible for this discrepancy. Chloroquine binding to plasma proteins is stereoselective, favouring S(+)-chloroquine (67% vs 35% for the R-enantiomer). Hence, unbound plasma concentrations are higher for R(-)-chloroquine. Following separate administration of the individual enantiomers, R(-)-chloroquine reached higher and more sustained blood concentrations. The shorter half-life of S(+)-chloroquine appears secondary to its faster clearance. Blood concentrations of the S(+)-forms of desethylchloroquine always exceeded those of the R(-)-forms, pointing to a preferential metabolism of S(+)-chloroquine.

      1. Five healthy volunteers received, in a randomised crossover design study, a 155 mg oral tablet and an intravenous infusion of 155 mg racemic hydroxychloroquine (200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate) to assess the bioavailability of the commercially available tablet (Plaquenil, Winthrop Laboratories, Australia).
      2. The terminal elimination half-life of hydroxychloroquine is more than 40 days, thus blood and urine samples were collected for 5 months following each dose to characterise adequately the terminal elimination phase and obtain accurate estimates of the areas under the concentration-time curves.
      3. The mean (+/- s.d.) fraction of the oral dose absorbed, estimated from the blood and urine data, was 0.74 (+/- 0.13). A wide range of estimates of the fraction of the oral dose absorbed was calculated from the plasma data (0.41 - 1.53), reflecting the difficulties of accurate measurement of hydroxychloroquine in plasma.
      4. A period of 6 months is required to achieve 96% of steady-state levels of hydroxychloroquine with the usual once daily, oral dosage regimen. Pharmacokinetic factors may thus be partly responsible for the delayed action of the drug in rheumatic conditions.
      5. Haemodialysis will not aid in the case of oral overdose with hydroxychloroquine. Although the proportionate increase in clearance may be large, the increase in the fraction of the dose excreted will be negligible. The extensive sequestration of the drug by tissues limits effectiveness of haemodialysis.

    > Abstract
      Coronaviruses can cause respiratory and enteric disease in a wide variety of human and animal hosts. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences of zoonotic coronavirus infections in humans. In 2012, a similar previously unknown coronavirus emerged, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), thus far causing over 650 laboratory-confirmed infections, with an unexplained steep rise in the number of cases being recorded over recent months. The human MERS fatality rate of ∼30% is alarmingly high, even though many deaths were associated with underlying medical conditions. Registered therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus infections are not available. Moreover, the pace of drug development and registration for human use is generally incompatible with strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, we have screened a library of 348 FDA-approved drugs for anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell culture. If such compounds proved sufficiently potent, their efficacy might be directly assessed in MERS patients. We identified four compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in the low-micromolar range (50% effective concentrations [EC50s], 3 to 8 μM). Moreover, these compounds also inhibit the replication of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E. Although their protective activity (alone or in combination) remains to be assessed in animal models, our findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with zoonotic coronaviruses like MERS-CoV. Although they may not necessarily reduce viral replication to very low levels, a moderate viral load reduction may create a window during which to mount a protective immune response.

Repurposing of approved pharmaceutical drugs for new indications presents an attractive alternative to clinicians, researchers, public health agencies, drug developers, and funding agencies. Given the development times and manufacturing requirements for new products, repurposing of existing drugs is likely the only solution for outbreaks due to emerging viruses. In the studies described here, a library of 290 compounds was screened for antiviral activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Selection of compounds for inclusion in the library was dependent on current or previous FDA approval or advanced clinical development. Some drugs that had a well-defined cellular pathway as target were included. In total, 27 compounds with activity against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were identified. The compounds belong to 13 different classes of pharmaceuticals, including inhibitors of estrogen receptors used for cancer treatment and inhibitors of dopamine receptor used as antipsychotics. The drugs identified in these screens provide new targets for in vivo studies as well as incorporation into ongoing clinical studies.

    > Abstract
      We report on chloroquine, a 4-amino-quinoline, as an effective inhibitor of the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vitro. Chloroquine is a clinically approved drug effective against malaria. We tested chloroquine phosphate for its antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-induced cytopathicity in Vero E6 cell culture. Results indicate that the IC50 of chloroquine for antiviral activity (8.8 ± 1.2 μM) was significantly lower than its cytostatic activity; CC50 (261.3 ± 14.5 μM), yielding a selectivity index of 30. The IC50 of chloroquine for inhibition of SARS-CoV in vitro approximates the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached during treatment of acute malaria. Addition of chloroquine to infected cultures could be delayed for up to 5 h postinfection, without an important drop in antiviral activity. Chloroquine, an old antimalarial drug, may be considered for immediate use in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV infections.

    > Abstract
      Compounds approved for therapeutic use and in vitro inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were evaluated for inhibition in the mouse SARS-CoV replication model. A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-α) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon (IFN) inducer, Ampligen® (poly I:poly C124), were the only compounds that potently inhibited virus titres in the lungs of infected mice as assessed by CPE titration assays. When mice were dosed intraperitoneally (i.p.) with IFN-α B/D once daily for 3 days beginning 4 h after virus exposure, SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected mice was reduced by 1 log10 at 10,000 and 32,000 IU; at the highest dose of 100,000 IU, virus lung titres were below detectable limits. Ampligen® used i.p. at 10 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure also reduced virus lung titres to below detectable limits. Nelfinavir, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, calpain inhibitor VI, 3-deazaneplanocin A and Alferon® (human leukocyte IFN-α-n3) did not significantly reduce lung virus titres in mice. Anti-inflammatory agents, chloroquine, amodiaquin and pentoxifylline, were also inactive in vivo, suggesting that although they may be useful in ameliorating the hyperinflammatory response induced by the virus infection, they will not significantly reduce the replication of the virus, the inducer of inflammatory response. Thus, anti-inflammatory agents may only be useful in treating virus lung infections if used in combination with agents that inhibit virus replication. In summary, the data suggest that induction of IFN by mismatched dsRNA or actual treatment with exogenous IFN-α can inhibit SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of mice.

    > Abstract
      Cardiotoxicity is a rare but serious complication of hydroxychloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatological disorders. We describe typical clinical, echocardiographic, and histological features of this rare condition according to the currently available literature, illustrated with a recent new biopsy-proven case of hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity in a 52-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis. Presentation in this case was of a rapidly progressive decompensated biventricular cardiomyopathy associated with recurrent biomarker elevations, conduction system disease, and possibly neuromyotoxicity. Death occurred suddenly 2 months after diagnosis despite drug discontinuation and clinical improvement. The potential role of cardiac magnetic resonance delayed gadolinium enhancement imaging in the prognosis of this toxic cardiomyopathy is also introduced. This case-based literature review highlights that, although rare, hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity can be fatal, particularly if irreversible histopathological changes have occurred prior to drug discontinuation. Given this, regular screening with 12-lead electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography to detect conduction system disease and/or biventricular morphological or functional changes should be considered in hydroxychloroquine-treated patients in addition to recommended ophthalmological screening.

    head = Although the viruses identified may have been noninfectious, health care workers should be aware that SARS coronavirus can contaminate environmental surfaces in the hospital, and fomites should be considered to be a possible mode of transmission of SARS.

    > Background
      Health care workers continued to contract severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), even after barrier precautions were widely implemented.

    > Methods
      We explored the possible contribution of contaminated hospital surfaces to SARS transmission by swabbing surfaces in 2 hospitals and testing the swab samples by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture.

    > Results
      Twenty-six of 94 swab samples tested positive for viral RNA. Swab samples of respiratory secretions from each of the 4 patients examined tested positive by RT-PCR, as were 12 of 43 swabs from patient rooms and 10 of 47 swabs from other parts of the hospital, including the computer mouses at 2 nursing stations and the handrail of the public elevator. Specimens from areas with patients with SARS in the most infectious phase of illness (days 5–15 after onset) were more likely to be RNA positive than were swab specimens from elsewhere (24 of 63 samples vs. 2 of 31 samples; P = .001). All cultures showed no growth.

The full genomic sequence of SL-CoV WIV16 (GenBank accession number KT444582) was determined and contained 30,290 nucleotides (nt) and a poly(A) tail which is slightly larger than those of SARS-CoVs and other bat SL-CoVs.

Frequent recombination events have happened among those SARSr-CoVs in the same cave. There is sufficient evidence that SARS-CoV most likely originated from horseshoe bats via recombination events among existing SARSr-CoVs. Various SARSr-CoVs capable of using human ACE2 are still circulating among bats in this region.

    > Abstract
      A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China. However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.

    quote !i = The genomes of SARS-CoVs from patients during the early epidemic phase and civet SARS-CoVs all contained a single full-length ORF8. We have found that a number of bat SARSr-CoVs from this cave possessed a complete ORF8 highly similar to that of early human/civet SARS-CoV (>97% nt sequence identity), represented by strain Rf4092. This provided further evidence for the source of human SARS-CoV ORF8 in bats.

    # quote !s = Taken together, the evidence of recombination events among SARSr-CoVs harbored by bats in this single location suggests that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated as a result of a series of recombination within the S gene and around ORF8. This could have been followed by the spillover from bats to civets and people either in the region, or during movement of infected animals through the wildlife trade. However, given the paucity of data on animal trade prior to the SARS outbreak, the likely high geographical sampling bias in bat surveillance for SARSr-CoVs in southern China, and the possibility that other caves harbor similar bat species assemblages and a rich diversity of SARSr-CoVs, a definite conclusion about the geographical origin of SARS-CoV cannot be drawn at this point.

Nonetheless, since the correlation between the host species and the phylogeny of SARSr-CoV ORF1ab seems limited, more SARSr-CoV sequences need to be obtained from different Rhinolophus bat species in both locations in Yunnan, and from other locations in southern China. In particular, it will be important to assess whether R. ferrumequinum played a more important role in the evolution of SARS-CoV ORF1ab.

These 7 strains, plus Rs4874 and the previously studied WIV1 and RsSHC014, could represent all types of S variants of SARSr-CoVs in this location. However, none of the strains with deletions in the RBD could be rescued from Vero E6 cells.

      The origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) remains unclear. Evidence based on Bayesian scanning plots and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods indicates that SARS‐CoV, for the largest part of the genome (∼80%), is more closely related to Group II coronaviruses sequences, whereas in three regions in the ORF1ab gene it shows no apparent similarity to any of the previously characterized groups of coronaviruses.

Approximately one-half of recognized Nipah case patients in Bangladesh developed their disease following person-to-person transmission of the virus.

    > Abstract
      Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus whose reservoir host is fruit bats of the genus Pteropus . Occasionally the virus is introduced into human populations and causes severe illness characterized by encephalitis or respiratory disease. The first outbreak of NiV was recognized in Malaysia, but 8 outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001. The primary pathways of transmission from bats to people in Bangladesh are through contamination of raw date palm sap by bats with subsequent consumption by humans and through infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats), presumably from consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine with subsequent transmission to people. Approximately one-half of recognized Nipah case patients in Bangladesh developed their disease following person-to-person transmission of the virus. Efforts to prevent transmission should focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and reducing family members' and friends' exposure to infected patients' saliva.

The most frequently implicated route is ingestion of fresh date palm sap. Date palm sap is harvested from December through March, particularly in west central Bangladesh. A tap is cut into the tree trunk and sap flows slowly overnight into an open clay pot. Infrared camera studies confirm that P. giganteus bats frequently visit date palm sap trees and lick the sap during collection. NiV can survive for days on sugar-rich solutions such as fruit pulp.

Twenty-one of the 23 index NiV case patients recognized in Bangladesh developed their initial symptoms during the December through March date palm sap collection season.

    # quote !c = A second route of transmission for NiV from bats to people in Bangladesh is via domestic animals. Fruit bats commonly drop partially eaten saliva-laden fruit. Domestic animals in Bangladesh forage for such food. Date palm sap that is contaminated with bat feces and so is unfit for human consumption is also occasionally fed to domestic animals. The domestic animals may become infected with NiV, and shed the virus to other animals, including humans.

A pig herd visited the community two weeks before the 2003 Nipah outbreak in Naogaon and contact with the pigs was associated with illness (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.3–27.8; P=.007). In 2004, one family explained that they owned 2 goats that their son frequently played with. The goats became ill with fever, difficulty walking, walking in circles, and frothing at the mouth. The parents believe their son had contact with goat saliva while the goats were ill. Both goats died. Within 2 weeks of the goats' death, the child developed encephalitis that was confirmed to be Nipah by antibody testing. Third, some people may come into direct contact with NiV-infected bat secretions. In the Goalando outbreak in 2004, persons who climbed trees were more likely to develop NiV infection than were control patients (OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.3-∞).

In both the Faridpur outbreak in 2004 and the Thakurgaon outbreak in 2007, persons who were in a room when a Nipah patient was coughing or sneezing were at increased risk of Nipah virus infection. Across all recognized outbreaks in Bangladesh from 2001 through 2007, Nipah patients with respiratory symptoms were more likely to transmit Nipah.

If the NiV strain was central to person-to-person transmission, then secondary cases of NiV would be more likely to become NiV transmitters, than primary cases (because secondary cases would already have selected for strains predisposed to person-to-person transmission). However, in the review of 7 years of human Nipah infection in Bangladesh, secondary cases were no more or less likely to become Nipah transmitters than were primary cases.

    # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    # quote !k = The epidemiology of NiV transmission in Bangladesh suggests two avenues to prevent human disease. The first is limiting exposure of Bangladeshi villagers to NiV contaminated fresh date palm sap. A second area for targeted intervention is reducing the exposure of caretakers to the saliva of seriously ill persons. An important research priority is to identify approaches that can be consistently implemented in these low income settings where family members are caring for patients with severe respiratory and neurological disease. For example, family members who washed their hands with soap after caring for Nipah patients were significantly less likely to become infected. If such practices were widely adopted, they would lessen the risk of person-to-person transmission of NiV and other pathogens.

    > Abstract
      The coronavirus spike protein (S) plays a key role in the early steps of viral infection, with the S1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the S2 domain mediating membrane fusion. In some cases, the S protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S1–S2 boundary. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S2 domain (S2′, R797). Mutation of R797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell–cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2′ cleavage site within S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2′), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S2′ position allowed trypsin-independent cell–cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S2′), acting in concert with the S1–S2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity.

The mutant R667N was still able to cause cell–cell fusion; however, the fusion was not as efficient as that observed for the wild-type protein (maximum fusion for the mutant was ≈50% of the fusion of the wild-type protein). These data suggest that although the R667 at the S1–S2 boundary does have some role in cleavage activation of SARS-CoV S-mediated membrane fusion, other residues are likely to have more critical roles.

    # quote !e = IBV Beaudette was the only coronavirus for which the ProP server predicted a furin site clearly above threshold within S2. However, analysis of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed a relatively high cleavage potential by furin at the S2′ position, with very limited cleavage potential at the S1–S2 boundary, indicating the possibility of a cryptic cleavage site at the S2′ position. The S2′ site of SARS-CoV S comprises a dibasic motif K796, R797 that could be such a cleavage site, and so we decided to investigate the role of these 2 basic residues in the membrane fusion and entry of SARS-CoV.

    # / April, 2009 - PNAS

Analysis of the role of each residue independently shows that mutation of K796 only partially affected the fusion induced by trypsin (79.5% ± 4.9%), whereas mutation of R797 completely blocked membrane fusion induced by trypsin (2.5% ± 0.8%). The mutation R667N (S1–S2) had limited fusion activity (48.8% ± 2.9%).

As expected, the effect of mutation K796A was weak (84.8% ± 14% of the wild-type level), but mutation of R797 induced a strong decrease of infection induced by trypsin (3.8% ± 2.3% of the wild-type level). Surprisingly, whereas mutation R667N decreased cell–cell fusion induced by trypsin by ≈50%, infection recovery induced by trypsin was strongly impaired (21.4% ± 10.6% of the wild type). This suggests that in the context of the virus infection, cleavage at the S1–S2 boundary may play a more important role than in cell–cell fusion.

    head = We show that furin cleavage at the modified R667 position generates discrete S1 and S2 subunits and potentiates membrane fusion activity. The lack of effect of furin cleavage on virion infectivity mirrors that observed in the normally cleaved S glycoprotein of the murine coronavirus and highlights an additional level of complexity in coronavirus entry.

    > Abstract
      The fusogenic potential of Class I viral envelope glycoproteins is activated by proteloytic cleavage of the precursor glycoprotein to generate the mature receptor-binding and transmembrane fusion subunits. Although the coronavirus (CoV) S glycoproteins share membership in this class of envelope glycoproteins, cleavage to generate the respective S1 and S2 subunits appears absent in a subset of CoV species, including that responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To determine whether proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein might be important for the newly emerged SARS-CoV, we introduced a furin recognition site at single basic residues within the putative S1–S2 junctional region. We show that furin cleavage at the modified R667 position generates discrete S1 and S2 subunits and potentiates membrane fusion activity. This effect on the cell–cell fusion activity by the S glycoprotein is not, however, reflected in the infectivity of pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the cleaved glycoprotein. The lack of effect of furin cleavage on virion infectivity mirrors that observed in the normally cleaved S glycoprotein of the murine coronavirus and highlights an additional level of complexity in coronavirus entry.

The S1 and S2 subunits were absent in FD11 cells, and S1 was not detected in the cell culture medium. These findings provide evidence that proteolytic cleavage in the furin-site-containing mutants is indeed mediated by the furin protease.

These findings suggest that the furin-mediated cleavage event at R667 is disrupted by the substitution of serine and, importantly, is responsible for the generation of the S1 subunit in the wild-type and HTVR glycoproteins. By contrast, the larger S1-like fragment thought to represent cleavage at the RNTR site at position 758–761 was produced and shed by both the R667S and K672S mutants and by the wild-type glycoprotein.

Expression of the ACE2 receptor remained essential for entry. Thus, the enhanced facility of the furin-cleaved HTVR glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion is apparently not reflected in the overall process of virion entry. The disconnect between the membrane fusion activity of the S glycoprotein and its ability to mediate viral entry, demonstrated here in the normally uncleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and previously in the normally cleaved glycoprotein of MHV, highlights unresolved complexities in the pathway used by CoVs to infect target cells.

However, pre-cleavage was not essential for S protein activation by TMPRSS2 and Caco-2 cell entry driven by a MERS-S variant lacking pre-cleavage was still TMPRSS2 dependent.

    > Abstract
      The Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe disease and has pandemic potential. Therefore, development of antiviral strategies is an important task. The activation of the viral spike protein (S) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential therapeutic targets. The cellular proteases furin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 can activate MERS-S and may cleave the S protein at two distinct sites, termed S1/S2 and S2′. Moreover, a potential cathepsin L cleavage site in MERS-S has been reported. However, the relative importance of these sites for MERS-S activation is incompletely understood. Here, we used mutagenic analysis and MERS-S-bearing vectors to study the contribution of specific cleavage sites to S protein-driven entry. We found that an intact S1/S2 site was only required for efficient entry into cells expressing endogenous TMPRSS2. In keeping with a previous study, pre-cleavage at the S1/S2 motif (RSVR) was important although not essential for subsequent MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, and indirect evidence was obtained that this motif is processed by a protease depending on an intact RXXR motif, most likely furin. In contrast, the S2′ site (RSAR) was required for robust viral entry into all cell lines tested and the integrity of one of the two arginines was sufficient for efficient entry. These findings suggest that cleavage at S2′ is carried out by proteases recognizing a single arginine, most likely TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Finally, mutation of the proposed cathepsin L site did not impact viral entry and double mutation of S1/S2 and S2′ site was compatible with cathepsin L- but not TMPRSS2-dependent host cell entry, indicating that cathepsin L can process the S protein at auxiliary sites. Collectively, our results indicate a rigid sequence requirement for S protein activation by TMPRSS2 but not cathepsin L.

Moreover, residual entry of the S1/S2 mutant into Caco-2 cells was not facilitated by cathepsin L, as one would have expected from previous work with Calu-3 and Huh7/TMPRSS2 cells16, but remained TMPRSS2 dependent.

Thus, active cathepsin L seems to be expressed in Caco-2 cells. Finally, our results suggest that the second arginine at the S2′ site might be essential for MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, since mutation of this residue markedly reduced S protein-driven entry into Caco-2 cells, while mutation of the first arginine did not diminish entry efficiency.

    > Abstract
      T-cell receptors recognize peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC). The ability of the T-cell receptor (TCR) to recognize more than one peptide-MHC structure defines cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity is a documented phenomenon of the immune system whose importance is still under investigation. There are a number of rational arguments for cross-reactivity. These include the discrepancy between the theoretical high number of pathogen-derived peptides and the lower diversity of the T-cell repertoire, the need for recognition of escape variants, and the intrinsic low affinity of this receptor−ligand pair. However, quantifying the phenomenon has been difficult, and its immunological importance remains unknown. In this review, we examined the cases for and against an important role for cross reactivity. We argue that it may be an essential feature of the immune system from the point of view of biological robustness.

  // Lifting the Lid on Toilet Plume Aerosol: A Literature Review With Suggestions for Future Research

    head = Contaminated toilets have been clearly shown to produce large droplet and droplet nuclei bioaerosols during flushing, and research suggests that this toilet plume could play an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases for which the pathogen is shed in feces or vomit. The possible role of toilet plume in airborne transmission of norovirus, SARS, and pandemic influenza is of particular interest.

    > Background
      The potential risks associated with “toilet plume” aerosols produced by flush toilets is a subject of continuing study. This review examines the evidence regarding toilet plume bioaerosol generation and infectious disease transmission.

    > Methods
      The peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched to identify articles related to aerosol production during toilet flushing, as well as epidemiologic studies examining the potential role of toilets in infectious disease outbreaks.

    > Results
      The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.

    > Conclusion
      Research suggests that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities.

    head = Viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. Toilets are an important source of viral contamination

    > Background
      The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations.

    > Methods
      To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used.

    > Results
      On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination.

    > Conclusions
      The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread.

The reason for this contradiction seems to be the interference of dirtiness on PCR enzymes, as demonstrated by our experiments on artificially contaminated surfaces, as well as previous studies. We can conclude that molecular data on surfaces before disinfection are affected by underestimation due to interference by organic substances on PCR and data obtained after disinfection are affected by overestimation due to the detection of noninfective DNA. Thus, the validity of TVBC abatement for predicting virus removal should be assessed through further investigation.

    head = We were able to show when simulating loose stool that material deposited both on the sidewalls and in the bowl water were involved in the dissemination of micro‐organisms into the air and onto surrounding surfaces. Sequential flushing resulted in further distribution of micro‐organisms into the air although the numbers declined after each flush. Serratia adhering to the sidewalls, as well as free‐floating organisms in the toilet water, were responsible for the formation of bacterial aerosols.

    > Aims
      To determine the level of aerosol formation and fallout within a toilet cubicle after flushing a toilet contaminated with indicator organisms at levels required to mimic pathogen shedding during infectious diarrhoea.

    > Methods and Results
      A semisolid agar carrier containing either Serratia marcesens or MS2 bacteriophage was used to contaminate the sidewalls and bowl water of a domestic toilet to mimic the effects of soiling after an episode of acute diarrhoea. Viable counts were used to compare the numbers of Serratia adhering to the porcelain surfaces and those present in the bowl water before and after flushing the toilet. Air sampling and settle plates were used to determine the presence of bacteria or virus‐laden aerosols within the toilet cubicle. After seeding there was a high level of contamination on the porcelain surfaces both under the rim and on the sides of the bowl. After a single flush there was a reduction of 2·0–3·0 log cycles cm−2 for surface attached organisms. The number of micro‐organisms in the bowl water was reduced by 2·0–3·0 log cycles ml−1 after the first flush and following a second flush, a further reduction of c. 2·0 log cycles ml−1 was achieved. Micro‐organisms in the air were at the highest level immediately after the first flush (mean values, 1370 CFU m−3 for Serratia and 2420 PFU m−3 for MS2 page). Sequential flushing resulted in further distribution of micro‐organisms into the air although the numbers declined after each flush. Serratia adhering to the sidewalls, as well as free‐floating organisms in the toilet water, were responsible for the formation of bacterial aerosols.

    > Conclusion
      Although a single flush reduced the level of micro‐organisms in the toilet bowl water when contaminated at concentrations reflecting pathogen shedding, large numbers of micro‐organisms persisted on the toilet bowl surface and in the bowl water which were disseminated into the air by further flushes.

Darlow and Bale (1959) estimated that c. 80% of air‐borne particles released after flushing a toilet seeded with a liquid culture containing Serratia were probably <4 μ m.

Compared with the number of bacteria released into the air after the first flush, a second flush resulted in a threefold decrease and after the third flush the numbers had declined by almost 10‐fold. The decline in air‐borne bacteria correlated with the decreasing numbers present in the bowl water.

Although flushing reduced the initial level of colonization by about 2 log cycles, c. 103 CFU cm−2 persisted on the surfaces despite repeated flushing. When the bowl water was disinfected and neutralized prior to flushing it did not alter the level of bacteria attached to the sidewalls.

  // Potential for Aerosolization of Clostridium Difficile After Flushing Toilets: The Role of Toilet Lids in Reducing Environmental Contamination Risk
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2011.08.010
  ref 'Best_et_al_12_05_2011
    head = Our data suggest that lidless conventional toilets increase the risk of Clostridium difficile aerosolization and surrounding environmental contamination and thus transmission of bacteria. Our results also demonstrate that if lids are fitted to current models they will very likely become contaminated upon flushing. It also highlights the imperative for hand washing after toilet use, and frequent cleaning to remove contamination.

    > Background
      Toilet facilities in healthcare settings vary widely, but patient toilets are commonly shared and do not have lids. When a toilet is flushed without the lid closed, aerosol production may lead to surface contamination within the toilet environment.

    > Aim
      To substantiate the risks of airborne dissemination of C. difficile following flushing a toilet, in particular when lids are not fitted.

    > Methods
      We performed in-situ testing, using faecal suspensions of C. difficile to simulate the bacterial burden found during disease, to measure C. difficile aerosolization. We also measured the extent of splashing occurring during flushing of two different toilet types commonly used in hospitals.

    > Findings
      C. difficile was recoverable from air sampled at heights up to 25 cm above the toilet seat. The highest numbers of C. difficile were recovered from air sampled immediately following flushing, and then declined 8-fold after 60 min and a further 3-fold after 90 min. Surface contamination with C. difficile occurred within 90 min after flushing, demonstrating that relatively large droplets are released which then contaminate the immediate environment. The mean numbers of droplets emitted upon flushing by the lidless toilets in clinical areas were 15–47, depending on design. C. difficile aerosolization and surrounding environmental contamination occur when a lidless toilet is flushed.

    > Conclusion
      Lidless conventional toilets increase the risk of C. difficile environmental contamination, and we suggest that their use is discouraged, particularly in settings where CDI is common.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12406
  ref 'Lai_et_al_07_06_2017
    head = Flushing was activated by a flushometer operated at two pressure levels, 400 kP a (high pressure [HP]) and 200 kP a (low pressure [LP]), and by a water cistern tank placed 95 cm (high tank [HT]) and 46 cm (low tank [LT]) above the toilet seat. The emission strength in the HP condition was statistically greater than that in the LP condition, whereas the cistern tank system produced less emissions than the flushometer system, and tank height was not found to be a sensitive parameter. Our findings also imply that a cistern tank design is preferable to a flushometer design with respect to aerosol generation.

    > Abstract
      The flushing of toilets generates contaminated aerosols, the transmission of which may cause the spread of disease, particularly in the immunocompromised or the elderly. This study investigated the emission strength of three types of airborne bacteria, namely Staphylococcus epidermidis , Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas alcaligenes , during toilet flushing in a custom‐built toilet under a controlled environment. Flushing was activated by a flushometer operated at two pressure levels, 400 kP a (high pressure [HP ]) and 200 kP a (low pressure [LP ]), and by a water cistern tank placed 95 cm (high tank [HT ]) and 46 cm (low tank [LT ]) above the toilet seat. The pathogens emitted by the first flush were calculated, with the correlations between airborne pathogen emissions and droplet concentration (HP , r =0.944, P <.001; LP , r =0.803, P <.001, HT , r =0.885, P <.05) and bacterial size (HP , r =−0.919, P <.001; LP , r =−0.936, P <.001; HT , r =−0.967, P <.05) in the different conditions then tested. The emission strength in the HP condition was statistically greater than that in the LP condition, whereas the cistern tank system produced less emissions than the flushometer system, and tank height was not found to be a sensitive parameter.

    # quote !c = Two salient points can be observed. First, the flushometer system produced a significantly higher droplet concentration than the tank system regardless of the water pressure or tank height. Second, emission was detected immediately after flushing was activated, and it took less than 15 seconds for the droplet concentration to increase to peak level.

    # quote !d = The water pressure for the cistern tank was 4.9 and 9.8 kPa for the LT and HT conditions, respectively, whereas that for the flushometer was 200 and 400 kPa. Hence, the pressure produced by the cistern tank was, at most, 5% (9.8/200) of that produced by the flushometer, which suggests that cistern systems create much less energy for the atomization of droplets, and thus generate significantly fewer droplets.

    # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
    # quote !e = It can be seen that the total emission strength in the HP condition was approximately 3.6, 21.0, and 19.8 times greater than that in the LP, HT, and LT conditions, respectively. These results are comparable to those published by Johnston et al.,14 who found the highest number of droplets, that is, 145 000, to be yielded by a flushometer operating at >350 kPa among the four flushing mechanisms they tested. However, that droplet number is only approximately half that found in the present study. The discrepancy may be attributable to their neglect of droplet loss inside the bowl. Their working pressure was also less than 400 kPa, and the different particle counters used in the two studies may also have affected the concentration results. Nonetheless, the two measurements are in fairly good agreement.

The HP to LP ratios for 0.3‐0.6 μm, 0.6‐10 μm, 1.5‐10 μm, and 2‐10 μm were 3.9, 2.3, 1.3, and 1.6, respectively, which are in line with the ratio of 3.6 for the total concentration. The magnitude of the ratios for the cistern tanks was very different. For droplet diameters in the range of 0.3‐0.6 μm, the HP/HT droplet emission ratio was 29.2 times, whereas that for those ranging from 0.6 to 10 μm, 1.5 to 10 μm, and 2 to 10 μm were 7.8, 10.2, and 6.8, respectively. Hence, compared with the flushometer, the droplet emission concentration produced by the cistern tank was only 3.4% for droplets sized ≤0.6 μm, whereas it ranged from 10% to 14% for droplets ≥1.5 μm. This finding has important implications, showing that an exposure risk still exists even for tank flushing (with a low degree of atomization energy) with a low level of total droplet emissions.

The strengths recorded under HP were almost double those recorded under LP. For E. coli tested in the HT and LT scenarios, the respective CFU results were very low.

The explanation is further clouded by the highly complex water flow (atomization process).

      Countermeasures to prevent and treat COVID-19 are a global health priority. We enrolled a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-recovered participants, developed neutralization assays to interrogate antibody responses, adapted our high-throughput antibody generation pipeline to rapidly screen over 1800 antibodies, and established an animal model to test protection. We isolated potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to two epitopes on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and to distinct non-RBD epitopes on the spike (S) protein. We showed that passive transfer of a nAb provides protection against disease in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters, as revealed by maintained weight and low lung viral titers in treated animals. The study suggests a role for nAbs in prophylaxis, and potentially therapy, of COVID-19. The nAbs define protective epitopes to guide vaccine design.

    > Abstract
      The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has a significant impact on global health, travel and economy. Therefore, preventative and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. Here, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from three convalescent COVID-19 patients using a SARS-CoV-2 stabilized prefusion spike protein. These antibodies had low levels of somatic hypermutation and showed a strong enrichment in VH1-69, VH3-30-3 and VH1-24 gene usage. A subset of the antibodies were able to potently inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection as low as 0.007 μg/mL. Competition and electron microscopy studies illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains multiple distinct antigenic sites, including several receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes as well as non-RBD epitopes. In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, the antibodies described here are promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.

      Understanding the particle size distribution in the air and patterns of environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for infection prevention policies.

Environmental sampling is conducted in three airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the general ward. 245 surface samples are collected. 56.7% of rooms have at least one environmental surface contaminated. High touch surface contamination is shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p = 0.01, χ2 test). Air sampling is performed in three of the 27 AIIRs in the general ward, and detects SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles of sizes >4 µm and 1–4 µm in two rooms, despite these rooms having 12 air changes per hour.

    > Background
      Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, can be used to treat cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with observed improvements in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case series.

    > Study Design and Methods
      This observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and followed up through April 21, 2020, was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14 days and stratified according to disease severity designated at admission (severe, ≥ 3 L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, pre/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers, and safety outcomes were assessed. Post hoc survival analyses were conducted for race/ethnicity.

    > Results
      Among the 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36% and 19% were black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78% vs 93%; P < .001), greater proportion requiring MV (44% vs 5%; P < .001), and longer median MV days (5.5 vs 1.0; P = .003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 153 [64%]) comprised 90% of those with severe disease; 44% of patients with nonsevere disease received tocilizumab for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (120 vs 71 mg/L; P < .001) and received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs 3 days; P < .001), but their survival was similar to that of patients with nonsevere disease (83% vs 91%; P = .11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75% (95% CI, 64-89). Following tocilizumab treatment, few adverse events occurred, and oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and soluble IL-2 receptor (also termed CD25) levels increased significantly. Survival in black and Hispanic patients, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in white patients (log-rank test, P = .002).

    > Interpretation
      A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence MV and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improved, with higher than expected survival. Randomized trials must confirm these findings.

  ref 'Williamson_et_al_04_22_2020
    head = Remdesivir is the first antiviral treatment with proven efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in an animal model of COVID-19. Remdesivir treatment in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 was highly effective in reducing clinical disease and damage to the lungs. The remdesivir dosing used in rhesus macaques is equivalent to that used in humans; however, due to the acute nature of the disease in rhesus macaques, it is hard to directly translate the timing of treatment used to corresponding disease stages in humans.

    > Background
      Effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    > Methods
      To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy.

    > Results
      In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue.

    > Conclusions
      Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. These data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia.

The efficacy of direct-acting antivirals against acute viral respiratory tract infections typically decreases with delays in treatment initation. Thus, remdesivir treatment in COVID-19 patients should be initiated as early as possible to achieve the maximum treatment effect.

The bioavailability and protective effect of remdesivir in the lungs of infected rhesus macaques supports treatment of COVID-19 patients with remdesivir. Data from clinical trials in humans are pending, but our data in rhesus macaques indicate that remdesivir treatment should be considered as early as clinically possible to prevent progression to severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.

    head = Many patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis for patients with COVID-19 when hospitalized. We recommend that dosing of VTE pharmacologic prophylaxis be evidence-based, whenever possible. Escalated doses can be considered for critically ill patients.

    > Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection that can, in severe cases, result in cytokine storm, systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy that is prognostic of poor outcomes. While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19- induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic. It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients. Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients. Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience. The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19. We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.

  doi: https://doi.org/xyz
  ref 'Gritti_et_al_06_20_2020
    head = Thirty patients received siltuximab, while 188 control patients received only best supportive care. Siltuximab-treated patients were matched to 30 control patients using the propensity score analysis of baseline covariates. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the siltuximab-treated than the matched-control cohort patients (HR 0.462, 95% CI 0.221-0.965); p=0.0399). The mean follow-up was 33.3 days (range 7-58 days) for the siltuximab-treated patients and 22.8 days (range 2-45 days) for the control cohort. Sixteen siltuximab-treated patients were discharged from hospital, four remained on mechanical ventilation, and 10 patients died.

    > Background
      Severe COVID-19 is characterised by interstitial pneumonia and hyperinflammation, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. Effective treatments are urgently needed, and IL-6 is a rational target to reduce hyperinflammation.
    > Methods
      An observational, control cohort, single-centre study initiated at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy included patients with COVID-19 confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA and interstitial pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Patients were treated with either best supportive care and siltuximab or best supportive care alone. Propensity score matching was applied to minimise differences in baseline covariates between patient cohorts. The main outcome was mortality in siltuximab-treated patients compared with patients in the matched-control cohort. This study (Siltuximab in Severe COVID-19, SISCO) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04322188.
    > Findings
      Thirty patients received siltuximab, while 188 control patients received only best supportive care. Siltuximab-treated patients were matched to 30 control patients using the propensity score analysis of baseline covariates. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the siltuximab-treated than the matched-control cohort patients (HR 0.462, 95% CI 0.221-0.965); p=0.0399). The mean follow-up was 33.3 days (range 7-58 days) for the siltuximab-treated patients and 22.8 days (range 2-45 days) for the control cohort. Sixteen siltuximab-treated patients were discharged from hospital, four remained on mechanical ventilation, and 10 patients died.
    > Interpretation
      Patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support may benefit from treatment with siltuximab to reduce mortality and cytokine-driven hyperinflammation associated with severe disease. These findings require validation in a randomised controlled clinical trial.

    head = The cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air–liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–coronavirus (CoV) produces a devastating primary viral pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and a marked increase in circulating cytokines. One of the major cell types to be infected is the alveolar type II cell. However, the innate immune response of primary human alveolar epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV has not been defined. Our objectives included developing a culture system permissive for SARS-CoV infection in primary human type II cells and defining their innate immune response. Culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an air–liquid interface (A/L) improved their differentiation and greatly increased their susceptibility to infection, allowing us to define their primary interferon and chemokine responses. Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of infected type II cells, electron micrographs demonstrated secretory vesicles filled with virions, virus RNA concentrations increased with time, and infectious virions were released by exocytosis from the apical surface of polarized type II cells. A marked increase was evident in the mRNA concentrations of interferon–β and interferon–λ (IL-29) and in a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A surprising finding involved the variability of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme–2, the SARS-CoV receptor, in type II cells from different donors. In conclusion, the cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air–liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.

The infected epithelial cells are likely the first responders, and initiate the innate immune response.

Presumably this interferon response increases the resistance of neighboring cells to infection.

    quote !c = The next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of cytokines, which can both attract and activate immune cells and stimulate neighboring cells to amplify the defensive response greatly by secreting additional cytokines and chemokines.

However, we did not measure ACE2 concentrations in cells from enough different donors who were also inoculated with SARS-CoV, and we did not measure the extent of virus infection to prove this quantitatively. Although immunoblotting showed a modest but variable increase in ACE2 expression by type II cells when cultured at the A/L compared with submerged conditons, we did not detect a consistent increase in the surface expression of ACE2 by either flow cytometry or surface biotinylation.

Because we did not demonstrate a clear increase in the surface expression of ACE2 under A/L conditions, we cannot conclude that the enhanced role of infection of type II cells at the A/L was attributable solely to the concentration of ACE2.

For example, after the first cycle of virus replication, the newly synthesized virus would be released into the scant amount of fluid on the apical surface, and this concentrated virus might accelerate secondary rounds of infection.

  // IL-17A Attenuates IFN-λ Expression by Inducing Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Expression in Airway Epithelium
  doi: https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800147

    head =  IL-17A attenuates virus-induced IFN-λ expression by enhancing SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression to inhibit autocrine signaling loops in human airway epithelial cells.

    > Abstract
      IFN-λ is a cytokine expressed in epithelial tissues and plays a central role in antiviral mucosal immune response. The expression of IFN-λ in the airway is impaired in chronic airway diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which renders patients susceptible to viral infection. IL-17A is associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis; however, IL-17A regulation of IFN-λ expression remains unclear. The aim of the current study is to clarify IL-17A–mediated regulatory mechanisms of IFN-λ expression in human airway epithelial cells. In this study, we have shown that polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and influenza A virus (IAV) infection increased IFN-λ expression at mRNA and protein levels in primary cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas IL-17A attenuated polyI:C- or IAV-induced IFN-λ expression. IFN-λ receptor 1 knockdown and a JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, attenuated polyI:C-induced IFN-λ expression, confirming that a positive autocrine feedback loop, the IFN-λ receptor–JAK–STAT pathway, was involved in IFN-λ expression. In Western blotting analysis, we demonstrated that polyI:C and IAV infection induced STAT1 phosphorylation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas IL-17A suppressed polyI:C- or IAV-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that cotreatment with IL-17A and polyI:C or IAV infection synergistically increased suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 and SOCS3 expression. SOCS1 small interfering RNA and SOCS3 small interfering RNA negated the inhibitory effect of IL-17A in polyI:C-induced IFN-λ expression by restoring attenuated STAT1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-17A attenuates virus-induced IFN-λ expression by enhancing SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression to inhibit autocrine signaling loops in human airway epithelial cells.

    quote !i = In addition, viral infection is the most common cause of acute exacerbation of asthma and COPD in clinical practice. Impairment of IFN-λ production would likely bring about a prolonged airway viral infection, which may provoke exacerbation of asthma and COPD.

    quote !j = In addition, we found that not only direct activation of NF-κB and IRF3 but also positive feedback through the IFNLR–JAK–STAT1 pathway via an autocrine mechanism were involved in polyI:C-induced IFN-λ expression. In the time-course study, induction of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3 were observed at 2–48 h after polyI:C treatment. Analysis of the signaling pathways revealed that NF-κB and IFR3 were involved in IFN-λ induction from the early stage. Conversely, the positive feedback loop of the IFNLR–JAK–STAT1 pathway was mostly related to persistent IFN-λ expression after polyI:C treatment.

    quote !k = When IFN-λ is produced in epithelial cells, IFN-λ binds to the heterodimeric receptor, IFNLR/IL10RB, leading to activation of the JAK–STAT pathway, which induces the expression of ISGs. However, no study had been reported regarding the role of a positive autocrine/paracrine feedback loop in IFN-λ expression. The findings in this study clearly demonstrate that a positive autocrine feedback loop exists in IFN-λ expression in airway epithelial cells, which results in sustained increase of IFN-λ production and persistent antivirus immune response in airway epithelium.

    / October, 2018 - J Immunol
    quote !l = Considering that IL-17A did not induce IFN-λ expression and had no additive effect on polyI:C-induced IFN-λ mRNA expression, it is reasonable that IL-17A–mediated NF-κB activation is not involved in IFN-λ expression.

    quote !m = In this study, we revealed that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 induced by cotreatment with IL-17A and polyI:C or IAV infection negatively regulated IFN-λ expression by inhibiting the JAK–STAT1 signaling pathway.

    head = COVID-19 does not affect everyone equally. In the US, it is exposing inequities in the health system. Emerging morbidity and mortality data have clearly demonstrated: a pandemic in which the brunt of the effects fall on already vulnerable US populations, and in which the deeply rooted social, racial, and economic health disparities in the country have been laid bare.

"These front-line workers, disproportionately black and brown, then are typically a part of residentially segregated communities”, said Barber. “They dont have that privilege of quote unquote ‘staying at home’, connecting those individuals to the communities they are likely to be a part of because of this legacy of residential segregation, or structural racism in our major cities and most cities in the United States.”

Poor white communities have been badly hit by the opioid crisis and across rural areas, especially in the southern states, high rates of non-communicable diseases are driven by conditions such as obesity. With higher COVID-19 mortality among those with underlying health conditions, these areas could be hit hard.

    head = We forecast that 2.9 million people will have been infected by 11 May, representing 4.4% of the population—a value inadequate for herd immunity. This indicates that efficient control measures that limit transmission risk will have to be maintained beyond 11 May 2020 to avoid a rebound of the pandemic.

    > Abstract
      France has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and went into lockdown on the 17 March 2020. Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find 3.6% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.7% die, ranging from 0.001% in those <20 years of age (ya) to 10.1% in those >80ya. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 2.90 to 0.67 (77% reduction). By 11 May 2020, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 2.8 million (range: 1.8–4.7) people, or 4.4% (range: 2.8–7.2) of the population, will have been infected. Population immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave if all control measures are released at the end of the lockdown.

The proportion of fatal cases who die rapidly remains approximately constant across age-groups.

Analyses of excess death will be important to explore these issues.

  ref 'Lei_et_al_01_06_2020
    head = In this study, we built a mathematical model to study the inflight transmission of different viruses, using a novel comparative analysis approach. The results suggested that the dominant transmission routes in air cabins are probably the close contact route for influenza, the fomite route for norovirus, and all 3 routes (airborne, close contact, and fomite routes) for SARS CoV.

    > Abstract
      Identifying the exact transmission route(s) of infectious diseases in indoor environments is a crucial step in developing effective intervention strategies. In this study, we proposed a comparative analysis approach and built a model to simulate outbreaks of 3 different in-flight infections in a similar cabin environment, that is, influenza A H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), and norovirus. The simulation results seemed to suggest that the close contact route was probably the most significant route (contributes 70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%-72%) in the in-flight transmission of influenza A H1N1 transmission; as a result, passengers within 2 rows of the index case had a significantly higher infection risk than others in the outbreak (relative risk [RR]: 13.4, 95% CI: 1.5-121.2, P = .019). For SARS CoV, the airborne, close contact, and fomite routes contributed 21% (95% CI: 19%-23%), 29% (95% CI: 27%-31%), and 50% (95% CI: 48%-53%), respectively. For norovirus, the simulation results suggested that the fomite route played the dominant role (contributes 85%, 95% CI: 83%-87%) in most cases; as a result, passengers in aisle seats had a significantly higher infection risk than others (RR: 9.5, 95% CI: 1.2-77.4, P = .022). This work highlighted a method for using observed outbreak data to analyze the roles of different infection transmission routes.

  ref 'Johnson_et_al_06_21_2011
    head = Significant variation of viral loading with the aerosol source region is likely, because pathogens tend to colonize specific regions of the respiratory tract and because the ratio of tissue surface to respiratory tract lining fluid volume varies throughout the respiratory tract.

    > Abstract
      An essential starting point when investigating the potential role of human expired aerosols in the transmission of disease is to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the expired aerosol generation process, including the aerosol size distribution, the various droplet production mechanisms involved and the corresponding sites of production within the respiratory tract. In order to approach this level of understanding we have integrated the results of two different investigative techniques spanning 3 decades of particle size from 700 nm to 1 mm, presenting a single composite size distribution, and identifying the most prominent modes in that distribution. We link these modes to specific sites of origin and mechanisms of production. The data for this were obtained using the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) covering the range 0.7≤d≤20 μm and Droplet Deposition Analysis (DDA) covering the range d≥20 μm.
      In the case of speech three distinct droplet size distribution modes were identified with count median diameters at 1.6, 2.5 and 145 μm. In the case of voluntary coughing the modes were located at 1.6, 1.7 and 123 μm. The modes are associated with three distinct processes: one occurring deep in the lower respiratory tract, another in the region of the larynx and a third in the upper respiratory tract including the oral cavity. The first of these, the Bronchiolar Fluid Film Burst (BFFB or B) mode contains droplets produced during normal breathing. The second, the Laryngeal (L) mode is most active during voicing and coughing. The third, the Oral (O) cavity mode is active during speech and coughing. The number of droplets and the volume of aerosol material associated with each mode of aerosol production during speech and coughing is presented. The size distribution is modeled as a tri-modal lognormal distribution dubbed the Bronchiolar/Laryngeal/Oral (B.L.O.) tri-modal model.

  ref 'Lin_et_al_01_26_2017
    head = Toilets, aeration basins, and converging flows in sewer systems can generate aerosolized viruses to varying extents. While toilets generate a large number of aerosols, the total volume of liquid aerosolized is extremely small, so the chance of aerosolizing viruses upon flushing is expected to be low.

    > Abstract
      Recent studies have shown that Ebola virus can persist in wastewater. We evaluated the potential for Ebola virus surrogates to be aerosolized from three types of wastewater systems: toilets, a lab-scale model of an aeration basin, and a lab-scale model of converging sewer pipes. We measured the aerosol size distribution generated by each system, spiked Ebola virus surrogates (MS2 and Phi6) into each system, and determined the emission rate of viruses into the air. The number of aerosols released ranged from 105 to 107 per flush from the toilets or per minute from the lab-scale models, and the total volume of aerosols generated by these systems was ∼10–9 to 10–7 mL per flush or per minute in all cases. MS2 and Phi6, spiked into toilets at an initial concentration of 107 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU mL–1), were not detected in air after flushing. Airborne concentrations of MS2 and Phi6 were ∼20 PFU L–1 and ∼0.1 PFU L–1, respectively, in the chambers enclosing the aeration basin and sewer models. The corresponding emission rates of MS2 and Phi6 were 547 PFU min–1 and 3.8 PFU min–1, respectively, for the aeration basin and 79 PFU min–1 and 0.3 PFU min–1 for the sewer pipes.

    head = Toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities.

    > Background
      The potential risks associated with "toilet plume" aerosols produced by flush toilets is a subject of continuing study. This review examines the evidence regarding toilet plume bioaerosol generation and infectious disease transmission.

    > Methods
      The peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched to identify articles related to aerosol production during toilet flushing, as well as epidemiologic studies examining the potential role of toilets in infectious disease outbreaks.

    > Results
      The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.

    > Conclusion
      Research suggests that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities.

    > Abstract
      The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is having a dramatic and deleterious impact on health services and the global economy. Grim public health statistics highlight the need for vaccines that can rapidly confer protection after a single dose and be manufactured using components suitable for scale-up and efficient distribution. In response, we have rapidly developed repRNA-CoV2S, a stable and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate comprised of an RNA replicon formulated with a novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION) designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery and immunogenicity. We show that intramuscular injection of LION/repRNA-CoV2S elicits robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a Type 1 T helper response as well as potent T cell responses in mice. Importantly, a single-dose administration in nonhuman primates elicited antibody responses that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    > Abstract
      The respective roles of high pressure and high tidal volume to promote high airway pressure pulmonary edema are unclear. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was shown to reduce lung water content in this type of edema, but its possible effects on cellular lesions were not documented. We compared the consequences of normal tidal volume ventilation in mechanically ventilated rats at a high airway pressure (HiP-LoV) with those of high tidal volume ventilation at a high (HiP-HiV) or low (LoP-HiV) airway pressure and the effects of PEEP (10 cm H2O) on both edema and lung ultrastructure. Pulmonary edema was assessed by extravascular lung water content and microvascular permeability by the drug lung weight and the distribution space of 125I-labeled albumin. HiP-LoV rat lungs were not different from those of controls (7 cm H2O peak pressure ventilation). By contrast, the lungs from the groups submitted to high volume ventilation had significant permeability type edema. This edema was more pronounced in LoP-HiV rats. It was markedly reduced by PEEP, which, in addition, preserved the normal ultrastructural aspect of the alveolar epithelium. This was in striking contrast to the diffuse alveolar damage usually encountered in this type of edema. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example of a protective effect of PEEP during permeability edema.

    head = Prolonged ventilation is associated with lung injury, infection, and multi-organ system dysfunction and if these may, even in part, be attributable to the physiological derangements described, then the real cost of ventilation, or oxygenation, is and has always been higher than was realized.

    > Abstract
      Positive pressure ventilation is a radical departure from the physiology of breathing spontaneously. The immediate physiological consequences of positive pressure ventilation such as haemodynamic changes are recognized, studied, and understood. There are other significant physiological interactions which are less obvious, more insidious, and may only produce complications if ventilation is prolonged. The interaction of positive pressure with airway resistance and alveolar compliance affects distribution of gas flow within the lung. The result is a wide range of ventilation efficacy throughout different areas of the lung, but the pressure differentials between alveolus and interstitium also influence capillary perfusion. The hydrostatic forces across the capillaries associated with the effects of raised venous pressures compound these changes resulting in interstitial fluid sequestration. This is increased by impaired lymphatic drainage which is secondary to raised intrathoracic pressure but also influenced by raised central venous pressure. Ventilation and PEEP promulgate further physiological derangement. In theory, avoiding these physiological disturbances in a rested lung may be better for the lung and other organs. An alternative to positive pressure ventilation might be to investigate oxygen supplementation of a physiologically neutral and rested lung. Abandoning heroic ventilation would be a massive departure from current practice but might be a more rationale approach to future practice.

    > Abstract
      The host response to viral infection includes the induction of type I interferons and the subsequent upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is an interferon-induced protein that has been implicated as a central player in the host antiviral response. Over the past 15 years, efforts to understand how ISG15 protects the host during infection have revealed that its actions are diverse and pathogen-dependent. In this Review, we describe new insights into how ISG15 directly inhibits viral replication and discuss the recent finding that ISG15 modulates the host damage and repair response, immune response and other host signalling pathways. We also explore the viral immune-evasion strategies that counteract the actions of ISG15. These findings are integrated with a discussion of the recent identification of ISG15-deficient individuals and a cellular receptor for ISG15 that provides new insights into how ISG15 shapes the host response to viral infection.

The ability of ISG15 to non-covalently bind to USP18 and to regulate type I interferon signalling in humans indicates that ISG15 may interact with other unidentified intracellular proteins, independent of conjugation, to regulate additional cellular processes. Uncovering the binding partners will be instrumental in understanding its molecular mechanism of action.

Moreover, we reveal a rejuvenating effect of these compounds on middleaged and terminally senescent primary fibroblasts. Although the anti-oxidant properties of QUER are already known, this is the first demonstration of its anti-ageing and rejuvenating effects in in vitro studies that link it with the proteasome and its activation

    > Abstract
      Homeostasis is a key feature of the cellular lifespan. Its maintenance influences the rate of ageing and it is determined by several factors, including efficient proteolysis. The proteasome is the major cellular proteolytic machinery responsible for the degradation of both normal and damaged proteins. Alterations of proteasome function have been recorded in various biological phenomena including ageing and replicative senescence. Proteasome activities and function are decreased upon replicative senescence, whereas proteasome activation confers enhanced survival against oxidative stress, lifespan extension and maintenance of the young morphology longer in human primary fibroblasts. Several natural compounds possess anti-ageing/anti-oxidant properties. In this study, we have identified quercetin (QUER) and its derivative, namely quercetin caprylate (QU-CAP) as a proteasome activator with anti-oxidant properties that consequently influence cellular lifespan, survival and viability of HFL-1 primary human fibroblasts. Moreover, when these compounds are supplemented to already senescent fibroblasts, a rejuvenating effect is observed. Finally, we show that these compounds promote physiological alterations when applied to cells (i.e. whitening effect). In summary, these data demonstrate the existence of naturally occurring anti-ageing products that can be effectively used through topical application.

  ref 'Yi_et_al_2004
    head = TGG ( tetra-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose) and luteolin offer excellent opportunities for further optimization and potential clinical use as anti-SARS drugs. TGG is a component of Galla chinensis that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating chronic coughing. Luteolin has been identified in extracts of many Chinese herbs such as Veronica lina riifolia Pall by MS. We found this was a component of Rhodiola kirilowii, which has been used in Chinese medicine for treating hepatitis and tuberculosis. These two compounds and the luteolin-related, FDA-approved quecertin, have potential for use in the clinical treatment of SARS.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the pathogen of SARS, which caused a global panic in 2003. We describe here the screening of Chinese herbal medicine-based, novel small molecules that bind avidly with the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV and thus can interfere with the entry of the virus to its host cells. We achieved this by using a two-step screening method consisting of frontal affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with a viral infection assay based on a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus. Two small molecules, tetra-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose (TGG) and luteolin, were identified, whose anti-SARS-CoV activities were confirmed by using a wild-type SARS-CoV infection system. TGG exhibits prominent anti-SARS-CoV activity with a 50% effective concentration of 4.5 μM and a selective index of 240.0. The two-step screening method described here yielded several small molecules that can be used for developing new classes of anti-SARS-CoV drugs and is potentially useful for the high-throughput screening of drugs inhibiting the entry of HIV, hepatitis C virus, and other insidious viruses into their host cells.
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease that spread to more than two-dozen countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe in the spring of 2003. Approximately 8,400 people worldwide suffered from SARS and more than 900 died according to a report of the World Health Organization executive board on 27 November 2003. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the pathogen that caused SARS. SARS-CoV is highly infectious and is transmitted via the respiratory route. Although the first outbreak is over, it is possible that even a low-level epidemic or accidental infection, as recently happened in Singapore and Taiwan, could cause a sudden worldwide epidemic. At present, few drugs are available for treating SARS. Ribavirin was initially used, but it proved to be barely effective and had serious side effects. Cinatl et al. reported recently that interferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV potency and that glycyrrhizin had an anti-SARS-CoV activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 300 mg/liter (364.5 μM).
      We have targeted our drug discovery to small molecules that can inhibit SARS-CoV from entering its host cells. Virus entry is an attractive target step for therapy because it can block the propagation of virus at an early stage, thus minimizing the chance for the virus to evolve and acquire drug resistance. Inhibitors of the entry of several important viruses have been developed. For example, a new class of virus entry inhibitors has been developed for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and one of these, T20 (enfuvirtide), is now in clinical usage. For the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the small molecules RFI 641 and VP-14637 have been developed to inhibit its entry process. For herpes simplex virus, entry inhibitors such as FGF4 signal peptide  and n-docosanol are under development.
      We have developed a two-step screening method combining frontal affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry (FAC/MS) and pseudotyped virus infection assay to search for drugs that can interfere with the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells. FAC/MS allows for competitive assays of interacting molecules, such as enzymes and ligands, as well as for a quick analysis and direct presentation of the assay. Here, in the first step, we use the FAC/MS to perform high-throughput screening of small molecules that can bind with high affinity to the SARS-CoV S2 protein. The other rationale of our study is that some of these S2-binding molecules may interfere with the function of the S protein, thus preventing the SARS-CoV from entering its host cells. To test this, we developed an HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus that can infect Vero E6 cells resulting in the cellular expression of luciferase that can be detected by luminometry. Thus, as a second step, we used HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus to check the function of the small molecules obtained in the first step. This system is highly sensitive, rapid, and reproducible; the materials are safe to handle and can be used for high-throughput screening.
      We used the FAC/MS approach to screen small molecule libraries consisting of extracts from 121 Chinese herbs, including Prunella vulgaris and Saussurea lappa Clarks, that exhibited antiviral activities against HIV-1, RSV, and hepatitis B virus. We identified two small molecules that bind avidly to the SARS S2 protein and can interfere with the entry of SARS-CoV into Vero E6 cells, with potent antiviral activities against wild-type SARS-CoV with EC50 values of 4.5 and 10.6 μM.

    head =  Properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges. There is no evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold. Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds. The optimal lozenge composition and dosage scheme need to be investigated further.

    > Objective
      To compare the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges with zinc gluconate lozenges in common cold treatment and to examine the dose-dependency of the effect.

    > Setting
      Placebo-controlled zinc lozenge trials, in which the zinc dose was > 75 mg/day. The pooled effect of zinc lozenges on common cold duration was calculated by using inverse-variance random-effects method.

    > Participants
      Seven randomised trials with 575 participants with naturally acquired common colds.

    > Results
      The mean common cold duration was 33% (95% CI 21% to 45%) shorter for the zinc groups of the seven included trials. Three trials that used lozenges composed of zinc acetate found that colds were shortened by 40% and four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28%. The difference between the two salts was not significant: 12 percentage points (95% CI: -12 to + 36). Five trials used zinc doses of 80-92 mg/day, common cold duration was reduced by 33%, and two trials used zinc doses of 192-207 mg/day and found an effect of 35%. The difference between the high-dose and low-dose zinc trials was not significant: 2 percentage points (95% CI: -29 to + 32).

    > Conclusion
       Properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges. There is no evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold. Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds. The optimal lozenge composition and dosage scheme need to be investigated further.

    > Abstract
      We have utilized an experimental model of human zinc deficiency for study of cytokines production by TH1 and TH2 cells. Additionally, we determined ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ and CD4+ CD45RA+ to CD4+CD45RO+ cells and percentages of CD73+ T cytolytic cells in the CD8+ subset. The data were collected during baseline, at the end of the zinc-restricted period, and following zinc repletion. Our results showed that functions of TH1 cells, as evidenced by production of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were decreased, whereas functions of TH2 cells (production of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) were unaffected by zinc deficiency. Thus an imbalance between TH1 and TH2 cells resulted because of zinc deficiency in humans. Our studies also showed that zinc may be required for regeneration of new CD4+ T lymphocytes and maintenance of T cytolytic cells. We conclude that an imbalance between TH1 and TH2 cells, decreased recruitment of T naive cells, and decreased percentage of T cytolytic cells may account for decreased cell-mediated immune functions in zinc-deficient subjects.

    > Abstract
      To investigate the effects of calcitriol on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 in diabetic nephropathy. Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were treated with calcitriol for 16 weeks. ACE/ACE2 and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) enzymes were measured in the kidneys of diabetic rats and rat renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to high glucose. Calcitriol reduced proteinuria in diabetic rats without affecting calcium-phosphorus metabolism. ACE and ACE2 levels were significantly elevated in diabetic rats compared to those in control rats. The increase in ACE levels was greater than that of ACE2, leading to an elevated ACE/ACE2 ratio. Calcitriol reduced ACE levels and ACE/ACE2 ratio and increased ACE2 levels in diabetic rats. Similarly, high glucose up-regulated ACE expression in NRK-52E cells, which was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor FR180204 or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. High glucose down-regulated ACE2 expression, which was blocked by FR180204, but not SB203580 or SP600125. Incubation of cells with calcitriol significantly inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK phosphorylation, but not JNK phosphorylation, and effectively attenuated ACE up-regulation and ACE2 down-regulation in high glucose conditions. The renoprotective effects of calcitriol in diabetic nephropathy were related to the regulation of tubular levels of ACE and ACE2, possibly by p38 MAPK or ERK, but not JNK pathways.

Calcitriol also modulated the expression of members of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin (Ang) I-converting enzymes (ACE and ACE2), renin and Ang II, which indicates that calcitriol may exert protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury.

    > Abstract
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the clinical manifestations of severe lung damage and respiratory failure. ALI and ARDS result are associated with high mortality in patients. At present, no effective treatments for ALI and ARDS exist. It is established that vitamin D exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, however, the specific effect of vitamin D on ALI remains largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether, and by which mechanism, vitamin D alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. The results demonstrated that a vitamin D agonist, calcitriol, exhibited a beneficial effect on LPS-induced ALI in rats; calcitriol pretreatment significantly improved LPS-induced lung permeability, as determined using Evans blue dye. Results from reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and ELISA analysis demonstrated that calcitriol also modulated the expression of members of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin (Ang) I-converting enzymes (ACE and ACE2), renin and Ang II, which indicates that calcitriol may exert protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury, at least partially, by regulating the balance between the expression of members of the RAS. The results of the present study may provide novel targets for the future treatment of ALI.

Subgroup analysis revealed that daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation without additional bolus doses protected against acute respiratory tract infection, whereas regimens containing large bolus doses did not.

    > Objective
      To assess the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of acute respiratory tract infection, and to identify factors modifying this effect.

    > Data Sources
      Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from randomised controlled trials.

    > Eligibility criteria for study selection
      Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 of any duration were eligible for inclusion if they had been approved by a research ethics committee and if data on incidence of acute respiratory tract infection were collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome.

    > Results
      25 eligible randomised controlled trials (total 11 321 participants, aged 0 to 95 years) were identified. IPD were obtained for 10 933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all participants (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analysis, protective effects were seen in those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for interaction=0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53) than in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≥25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.

    > Conclusions
      Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall. Patients who were very vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit.

Given that the VDR is exclusively involved in vitamin D signalling, our findings lend weight to the growing body of evidence suggesting a role for the vitamin D pathway in mediating protection against respiratory infections.

    > Abstract
      SNP in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene is associated with risk of lower respiratory infections. The influence of genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway resulting in susceptibility to upper respiratory infections (URI) has not been investigated. We evaluated the influence of thirty-three SNP in eleven vitamin D pathway genes (DBP, DHCR7, RXRA, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, CYP3A4, CYP27A1, LRP2, CUBN and VDR) resulting in URI risk in 725 adults in London, UK, using an additive model with adjustment for potential confounders and correction for multiple comparisons. Significant associations in this cohort were investigated in a validation cohort of 737 children in Manchester, UK. In all, three SNP in VDR (rs4334089, rs11568820 and rs7970314) and one SNP in CYP3A4 (rs2740574) were associated with risk of URI in the discovery cohort after adjusting for potential confounders and correcting for multiple comparisons (adjusted incidence rate ratio per additional minor allele ≥1·15, Pfor trend ≤0·030). This association was replicated for rs4334089 in the validation cohort (Pfor trend=0·048) but not for rs11568820, rs7970314 or rs2740574. Carriage of the minor allele of the rs4334089 SNP in VDR was associated with increased susceptibility to URI in children and adult cohorts in the United Kingdom.

Each increase in DHCR7/CYP2R1 allele score was associated with a 1.9 nmol/L lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and with increased all cause, cancer, and other mortality but not with cardiovascular mortality. The odds ratio for a genetically determined 20 nmol/L lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 1.30 (1.05 to 1.61) for all cause mortality, with a corresponding observational multivariable adjusted odds ratio of 1.21 (1.11 to 1.31).

    > Abstract
      1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] regulates calcium homeostasis and controls cellular differentiation and proliferation. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand-regulated transcription factor that recognizes cognate vitamin D response elements (VDREs) formed by direct or everted repeats of PuG(G/T)TCA motifs separated by 3 or 6 bp (DR3 or ER6). Here, we have identified direct 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes by combining 35,000+ gene microarrays and genome-wide screens for consensus DR3 and ER6 elements, and DR3 elements containing single nucleotide substitutions. We find that the effect of a nucleotide substitution on VDR binding in vitro does not predict VDRE function in vivo, because substitutions that disrupted binding in vitro were found in several functional elements. Hu133A microarray analyses, performed with RNA from human SCC25 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, identified more than 900 regulated genes. VDREs lying within −10 to +5 kb of 5′-ends were assigned to 65% of these genes, and VDR binding was confirmed to several elements in vivo. A screen of the mouse genome identified more than 3000 conserved VDREs, and 158 human genes containing conserved elements were 1,25(OH2)D3-regulated on Hu133A microarrays. These experiments also revealed 16 VDREs in 11 of 12 genes induced more than 10-fold in our previous microarray study, five elements in the human gene encoding the epithelial calcium channel TRPV6, as well as novel 1,25(OH2)D3 target genes implicated in regulation of cell cycle progression. The combined approaches used here thus provide numerous insights into the direct target genes underlying the broad physiological actions of 1,25(OH)2D3.

  // Decreased Bioavailability of Vitamin D in Obesity
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/72.3.690
  ref 'Wortsman_et_al_2020
    head = Obesity-associated vitamin D insufficiency is likely due to the decreased bioavailability of vitamin D(3) from cutaneous and dietary sources because of its deposition in body fat compartments.

    > Background
      Obesity is associated with vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

    > Objective
      This study assessed whether obesity alters the cutaneous production of vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) or the intestinal absorption of vitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol).

    > Design
      Healthy, white, obese [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) > or = 30] and matched lean control subjects (BMI </= 25) received either whole-body ultraviolet radiation or a pharmacologic dose of vitamin D(2) orally.

    > Results
      Obese subjects had significantly lower basal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and higher parathyroid hormone concentrations than did age-matched control subjects. Evaluation of blood vitamin D(3) concentrations 24 h after whole-body irradiation showed that the incremental increase in vitamin D(3) was 57% lower in obese than in nonobese subjects. The content of the vitamin D(3) precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin of obese and nonobese subjects did not differ significantly between groups nor did its conversion to previtamin D(3) after irradiation in vitro. The obese and nonobese subjects received an oral dose of 50000 IU (1.25 mg) vitamin D(2). BMI was inversely correlated with serum vitamin D(3) concentrations after irradiation (r = -0.55, P: = 0.003) and with peak serum vitamin D(2) concentrations after vitamin D(2) intake (r = -0.56, P: = 0.007).

    > Conclusions
      Obesity-associated vitamin D insufficiency is likely due to the decreased bioavailability of vitamin D(3) from cutaneous and dietary sources because of its deposition in body fat compartments.

  // Vitamin D Deficiency and Insufficiency Among US Adults: Prevalence, Predictors and Clinical Implications
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114518000491
  ref 'Liu_et_al_2018
    head = The prevalences of VDD (Vitamin D Deficiency) and VDI (Insufficiency) in 2001–2010 were 28·9 and 41·4 %, respectively. Adults who were black, less educated, poor, obese, current smokers, physically inactive and infrequent milk consumers had a higher prevalence of VDD. After adjustment for other potential predictors, obese adults showed 3·09 times higher prevalence of VDD and 1·80 times higher prevalence of VDI than non-obese adults. Physically inactive adults had 2·00 and 1·36 times higher prevalence of VDD and VDI than active peers.

    > Abstract
      Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and insufficiency (VDI) are increasing at a global level, and they are associated with increased risk of various diseases. However, little information is available on the prevalence and predictors of VDD and VDI in a representative population of US adults. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements were collected from 26 010 adults aged ≥18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2010. Using thresholds recommended by the Endocrine Society, VDD was defined as 25(OH)D<50 nmol/l and VDI as 50≤25(OH)D<75 nmol/l. Weighted multinomial log-binomial regression was conducted to estimate prevalence ratios of VDD and VDI. The prevalences of VDD and VDI in 2001-2010 were 28·9 and 41·4 %, respectively. Adults who were black, less educated, poor, obese, current smokers, physically inactive and infrequent milk consumers had a higher prevalence of VDD. After adjustment for other potential predictors, obese adults showed 3·09 times higher prevalence of VDD and 1·80 times higher prevalence of VDI than non-obese adults. Physically inactive adults had 2·00 and 1·36 times higher prevalence of VDD and VDI than active peers. Compared with frequent consumers, rare consumers of milk had 2·44 and 1·25 times higher prevalence of VDD and VDI, respectively. Current alcohol drinkers had 38 % lower prevalence of VDD than non-drinkers. Awareness of the high prevalence of VDD and VDI among US adults and related predictors could inform behavioural and dietary strategies for preventing VDD and monitoring VDI, especially in old, black, obese and inactive individuals who report rare consumption of milk.

    > Abstract
      This is a retrospective cohort study which included two cohorts (active and expired) of 780 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia. Age, sex, co-morbidity, Vitamin D status, and disease outcome (mortality) were extracted from electronic medical records. The aim was to determine patterns of mortality and associated factors, with a special focus on Vitamin D status. Results revealed that majority of the death cases were male and older and had pre-existing condition and below normal Vitamin D serum level. Univariate analysis revealed that older and male cases with pre-existing condition and below normal Vitamin D levels were associated with increasing odds of death. When controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, Vitamin D status is strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality outcome of cases.

    head = We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood donors. Convalescent SARS sera may contain cross-reactive antibodies against other betacoronaviruses and confound seroprevalence study for HCoV-EMC.

    > Objective
      A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease due to a novel betacoronavirus, human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), has emerged recently. HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 in Hong Kong. We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood donors in Southern China to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of HCoV-EMC and related viruses into humans.

    > Methods
      Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests.

    > Results
      Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of ≥1:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of <1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had significant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein. Virulence of SARS-CoV over other betacoronaviruses may boost cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against other betacoronaviruses.

    > Conclusion
      Convalescent SARS sera may contain cross-reactive antibodies against other betacoronaviruses and confound seroprevalence study for HCoV-EMC.

We detected antibodies to an average of 10 viral species per person and 84 species in at least two individuals. Although rates of specific virus exposure were heterogeneous across populations, antibody responses targeted strongly conserved "public epitopes" for each virus, suggesting that they may elicit highly similar antibodies.

    > Abstract
      The human virome plays important roles in health and immunity. However, current methods for detecting viral infections and antiviral responses have limited throughput and coverage. Here, we present VirScan, a high-throughput method to comprehensively analyze antiviral antibodies using immunoprecipitation and massively parallel DNA sequencing of a bacteriophage library displaying proteome-wide peptides from all human viruses. We assayed over 10(8) antibody-peptide interactions in 569 humans across four continents, nearly doubling the number of previously established viral epitopes. We detected antibodies to an average of 10 viral species per person and 84 species in at least two individuals. Although rates of specific virus exposure were heterogeneous across populations, antibody responses targeted strongly conserved "public epitopes" for each virus, suggesting that they may elicit highly similar antibodies. VirScan is a powerful approach for studying interactions between the virome and the immune system.

  // Cytomegalovirus Infection Enhances the Immune Response to Influenza
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa2293
  ref 'Furman_et_al_2015
    head = We found that CMV infection enhances the immune responses of younger adults, as it also in an inbred mouse model. The fact that it did not enhance the responses of older adults indicates that this effect requires a robust immune system, which is interesting in that it largely confines the benefits of infection to those of child-bearing age. Finally, while CMV is clearly a pathogen for immunodeficient individuals and some infants, the data presented here indicate that it is beneficial to a great many more people.


    > Abstract
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta-herpes virus present in a latent form in most people worldwide. In immunosuppressed individuals, CMV can reactivate and cause serious clinical complications, but the effect of the latent state on healthy people remains elusive. We undertook a systems approach to understand the differences between seropositive and negative subjects and measured hundreds of immune system components from blood samples including cytokines and chemokines, immune cell phenotyping, gene expression, ex vivo cell responses to cytokine stimuli and the antibody response to seasonal influenza vaccination. As expected, we found decreased responses to vaccination and an overall down-regulation of immune components in aged individuals regardless of CMV serostatus. In contrast, CMV-infected young adults exhibited an overall up-regulation of immune components including enhanced antibody responses to influenza vaccination, increased CD8+ T cell sensitivity, and elevated levels of circulating IFN-γ compared to uninfected individuals. Experiments with young mice infected with murine CMV also showed significant protection from an influenza virus challenge compared with uninfected animals, although this effect declined with time. These data show that CMV and its murine equivalent can have a beneficial effect on the immune response of young, healthy individuals, which may explain the continued coexistence of CMV and mammals throughout their evolution.

  ref 'Mcmichael_et_al_2020
    head = In total, 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been identified among residents, personnel, and visitors as of March 18, and 30 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in King County had identified at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. Staff working in multiple facilities while ill and transfers of patients from one facility to another potentially introduced Covid-19 into some of these facilities.

    > Background
      Long-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.

    > Methods
      After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.

    > Results
      As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.

    > Conclusion
      In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.

    > Background and objectives
      Pathogen reduction technologies are among methods to eliminate transfusion transmitted infections. Mirasol method using riboflavin in combination with ultraviolet rays is one of them. The aims of this study were to investigate the effectiveness of Mirasol method to inactivate some model pathogens as well as examination of the sensitivity of plasma proteins after treatment.

    > Materials and methods
      Riboflavin in 50μM concentration and ultraviolet (365 nm) in three different energy doses (3.6, 7.2, and 10.8 j/cm2) were employed to inactivate model pathogens. Four standard viruses were used in this study including Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus1 (HSV-1), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) and Polio Virus. 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) and Reed-Muench Methods were used to estimate viruses' titers. E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus were used as bacterial models. Four plasma proteins including factor V, VIII, fibrinogen and antithromin were used to determine their sensitivity to pathogen inactivation treatment.

    > Results
      The most pathogen reduction titre was determined for 15 minutes irradiation period equal to 10.8 J/cm2 that is corresponding to Log 6.10 for BVDV, Log 6.09 for HSV-1, Log 6.62 for VSV and Log 3.36 for Polio. Bacterial reduction titer was Log 6.94 for E. coli and Log 7.00 for S. aureus. Indicator proteins for plasma activity were determined to be 75% for factor V, 88% for factor VIII, 52% for fibrinogen and 94% for antithrombin.

    > Conclusion
      Results showed that the employed method can inactivate most of the pathogens in fresh frozen plasma. The acceptable activities of selected plasma proteins remained after treatment.

    > Abstract
      Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9
  ref 'Lin_et_al_2003
    head = While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.

    > Background
      The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection.

    > Methods
      HLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190 normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis.

    > Results
      Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a "severe cases" patient group from the infected "probable SARS" patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc = 0.0279).

    > Conclusions
      Densely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.

  ref 'Paul_et_al_2013
    head = Absolute binding capacity is a better predictor of immunogenicity, and analysis of epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database revealed that predictive efficacy is increased using allele-specific affinity thresholds. We investigated the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. Although no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than are HLA A alleles.

    > Abstract
      Prediction of HLA binding affinity is widely used to identify candidate T cell epitopes, and an affinity of 500 nM is routinely used as a threshold for peptide selection. However, the fraction (percentage) of peptides predicted to bind with affinities of 500 nM varies by allele. For example, of a large collection of ∼30,000 dengue virus–derived peptides only 0.3% were predicted to bind HLA A*0101, wheras nearly 5% were predicted for A*0201. This striking difference could not be ascribed to variation in accuracy of the algorithms used, as predicted values closely correlated with affinity measured in vitro with purified HLA molecules. These data raised the question whether different alleles would also vary in terms of epitope repertoire size, defined as the number of associated epitopes or, alternatively, whether alleles vary drastically in terms of the affinity threshold associated with immunogenicity. To address this issue, strains of HLA transgenic mice with wide (A*0201), intermediate (B*0702), or narrow (A*0101) repertoires were immunized with peptides of varying binding affinity and relative percentile ranking. The results show that absolute binding capacity is a better predictor of immunogenicity, and analysis of epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database revealed that predictive efficacy is increased using allele-specific affinity thresholds. Finally, we investigated the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. Although no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than are HLA A alleles.

    > Summary
      Following their discovery in the early 1970s, classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been the prototypical candidates for genetic susceptibility to infectious disease. Indeed, the original hypothesis for the extreme variability observed at HLA loci (H-2 in mice) was the major selective pressure from infectious diseases. Now that both the human genome and the molecular basis of innate and acquired immunity are understood in greater detail, do the classical HLA loci still stand out as major genes that determine susceptibility to infectious disease? This review looks afresh at the evidence supporting a role for classical HLA loci in susceptibility to infectious disease, examines the limitations of data reported to date, and discusses current advances in methodology and technology that will potentially lead to greater understanding of their role in infectious diseases in the future.

  # heterogenity in host susceptibility, model, underscoring the importance of heterogeneity in infectious disease systems, Heterogeneity in susceptibility is a key determinant of disease dynamics and impacts
  // Vaccine Effects on Heterogeneity in Susceptibility and Implications for Population Health Management
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00796-17
  ref 'Langwig_et_al_2017
    head = Our data emphasize the importance of incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility in estimates of control measure efficacy. Inclusion of this variance will help to improve prediction of vaccine effectiveness, provide insight into how vaccination shapes population susceptibility and have broad applicability to human, wildlife, and ecosystem health.

    > Abstract
      Heterogeneity in host susceptibility is a key determinant of infectious disease dynamics but is rarely accounted for in assessment of disease control measures. Understanding how susceptibility is distributed in populations, and how control measures change this distribution, is integral to predicting the course of epidemics with and without interventions. Using multiple experimental and modeling approaches, we show that rainbow trout have relatively homogeneous susceptibility to infection with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus and that vaccination increases heterogeneity in susceptibility in a nearly all-or-nothing fashion. In a simple transmission model with an R0 of 2, the highly heterogeneous vaccine protection would cause a 35 percentage-point reduction in outbreak size over an intervention inducing homogenous protection at the same mean level. More broadly, these findings provide validation of methodology that can help to reduce biases in predictions of vaccine impact in natural settings and provide insight into how vaccination shapes population susceptibility.

    > Importance
      Differences among individuals influence transmission and spread of infectious diseases as well as the effectiveness of control measures. Control measures, such as vaccines, may provide leaky protection, protecting all hosts to an identical degree, or all-or-nothing protection, protecting some hosts completely while leaving others completely unprotected. This distinction can have a dramatic influence on disease dynamics, yet this distribution of protection is frequently unaccounted for in epidemiological models and estimates of vaccine efficacy. Here, we apply new methodology to experimentally examine host heterogeneity in susceptibility and mode of vaccine action as distinct components influencing disease outcome. Through multiple experiments and new modeling approaches, we show that the distribution of vaccine effects can be robustly estimated. These results offer new experimental and inferential methodology that can improve predictions of vaccine effectiveness and have broad applicability to human, wildlife, and ecosystem health.

    quote !b = Heterogeneity in infectiousness can modify disease dynamics, but importantly must be correlated with susceptibility, contacts, or other parameters (e.g., mortality from disease) to influence the size of epidemics. This is because the mean of the distribution will be identical among infected cohorts unless other model parameters preferentially remove or add individuals that change this mean (e.g., individuals that are more infectious die before they transmit).

    / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
    quote !c = Conversely, like heterogeneity in susceptibility, heterogeneity in contacts will change dynamically over an epidemic as the individuals with the highest numbers of contacts become infected early in the epidemic and continue to infect others during their infectious period but then exit the infected pool as they recover (for pathogens with a recovered class). Therefore, adding heterogeneity in the encounter rate should further reduce the size of outbreaks, dependent on correlations between model parameters and the relative importance of each host trait in determining infection and mortality.

    quote !d = Excluding heterogeneity in susceptibility from epidemic models had a significant impact on disease dynamics. Using a polarized mode of vaccine action resulted in fewer infected individuals under a wide range of R0 values, whereas homogeneous protection led to all hosts becoming infected for R0 values of 6. While the fraction of hosts infected will depend on particular parameter estimates, and we have not exhausted all parameter combinations and shape possibilities, this study provides further evidence that heterogeneous susceptibility decreases the size of epidemics. This is because the polarized mode of vaccine action greatly reduced the susceptibility of a fraction of individuals, nearly completely protecting them against infection.

    / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
    quote !e = Transitions of susceptible individuals into the infected class occurred nonuniformly, with the most susceptible individuals first becoming infected, leaving increasingly resistant individuals in the susceptible class as the epidemic progressed. Conversely, the homogeneous model assumed that the susceptibility of all individuals was identical and therefore did not allow for the effect of cohort selection. The discrete all-or-nothing model overestimated vaccine protection compared to the experimentally derived distribution of vaccine protection. This further emphasizes that empirical estimates of vaccine protection can vastly improve epidemiological predictions and provide insight into vaccine programs.

It is possible that selective breeding may have contributed to decreased variation in susceptibility if hosts with lower susceptibility were selected from a population with greater variance. If selection is strongly directional and uncorrelated with other traits, susceptibility to a specific pathogen would be predicted to decrease and become more homogeneous over time, just as mean susceptibility decreases over the course of an epidemic

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.3636
  ref 'Ferrari_et_al_2006
    head = The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.

    > Abstract
      The spread of infectious disease through communities depends fundamentally on the underlying patterns of contacts between individuals. Generally, the more contacts one individual has, the more vulnerable they are to infection during an epidemic. Thus, outbreaks disproportionately impact the most highly connected demographics. Epidemics can then lead, through immunization or removal of individuals, to sparser networks that are more resistant to future transmission of a given disease. Using several classes of contact networks—Poisson, scale-free and small-world—we characterize the structural evolution of a network due to an epidemic in terms of frailty (the degree to which highly connected individuals are more vulnerable to infection) and interference (the extent to which the epidemic cuts off connectivity among the susceptible population that remains following an epidemic). The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.

  ref 'Bastier_et_al_2015
    head = Large-volume irrigation provides good distribution over the sinonasal cavities as a whole; and a stable, reproducible isotonic solution with slightly alkaline pH and a composition close to that of seawater optimizes trophic and functional recovery of the respiratory epithelium.

    > Abstract
      Nasal irrigation plays a non-negligible role in the treatment of numerous sinonasal pathologies and postoperative care. There is, however, a wide variety of protocols. The present review of the evidence-based literature sought objective arguments for optimization and efficacy. It emerged that large-volume low-pressure nasal douche optimizes the distribution and cleansing power of the irrigation solution in the nasal cavity. Ionic composition and pH also influence mucociliary clearance and epithelium trophicity. Seawater is less rich in sodium ions and richer in bicarbonates, potassium, calcium and magnesium than is isotonic normal saline, while alkaline pH and elevated calcium concentration optimized ciliary motility in vitro. Bicarbonates reduce secretion viscosity. Potassium and magnesium promote healing and limit local inflammation. These results show that the efficacy of nasal irrigation is multifactorial. Large-volume low-pressure nasal irrigation using undiluted seawater seems, in the present state of knowledge, to be the most effective protocol.

    head = Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

    > Background
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.

    > Methods
      We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.

    > Results
      After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

    > Conclusions
      Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

It is likely that persons who fly during the incubation period (within 10 days before the onset of illness) pose very little or no risk to other passengers. However, we might have missed some cases because of the low percentage of passengers from Flight 1 who were contacted and because of the limitations in routine surveillance.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    quote !g = As in our findings with regard to Flights 2 and 3, the risk of transmission can vary widely. The variation in risk might be influenced by the duration of the flight, the stage of illness, the type of air-ventilation system in use, the size of the aircraft, and the number of infected persons on board. In addition, some investigators have proposed that poorly characterized host factors in certain patients predispose them to transmit the virus to large numbers of persons (making them so-called “super-spreaders”), a hypothesis that has been used to explain epidemiologic clustering in Hong Kong and Singapore and that might be applicable to the index patient on Flight 2

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    quote !h = It is important to emphasize that the true attack rate on Flight 2 may be different from the rate we calculated. Sixteen of the 22 cases that resulted from this flight had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV. No specimens were available for testing from five patients, and one patient had a negative test; some patients who were deemed to have probable cases of SARS may not have been infected with SARS-CoV.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    quote !i = On the other hand, five of the cases resulted in death, and the other patients had illness compatible with a diagnosis of SARS whose onset occurred within the expected incubation period. Forty-six of the passengers who were considered not to have been infected were not interviewed, including the two who sat next to the index patient, and it is possible that routine surveillance missed some additional infections.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    quote !j = The fact that only 45 percent of the passengers were interviewed despite intensive investigation by three health departments over the course of two months highlights the difficulties faced by such investigations and raises the possibility that more transmission occurred than was recognized.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    quote !k = In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

  // Expulsion of group a hemolytic streptococci in droplets and droplet nuclei by sneezing, coughing and talking
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9343(48)90392-1
  ref 'Hamburger_et_al_1948
    head = Although sneezing probably accounts for a certain number of sporadic cases of hemolytic streptococcal infection, it is not, in our opinion, important in epidemics because it is not a common symptom and very few sneezes discharge significant numbers of beta hemolytic streptococci into the air as droplet nuclei. The rare carriers whose sneezes heavily contaminate the air may be very dangerous if they do not baffle the sneezes efficiently. Since the material atomized in a sneeze is saliva, these individuals represent a type of dangerous carrier whose nose culture may be negative.  whose nose culture may be negative. Coughing, likewise, is important only in sporadic infections for similar reasons. This symptom is more common than sneezing. Talking expels negligible numbers of hemolytic streptococci.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !b = Four dispersion patterns of beta hemolytic streptococci by sneezing were evident. In the most common, moderate numbers were expelled in large droplets which fell rapidly to the floor 1.5 feet from the sneezer, but very few or none in droplet nuclei. In one of two less common patterns, small numbers of beta streptococci were sneezed as droplet nuclei but none in large droplets; in the other, no beta streptococci were recovered from the air. In the rarest, of which only one example was found, large numbers of beta (and alpha) streptococci were expelled both as droplet nuclei and in large droplets; many were collected as far as 9.5 feet from the sneezer. The saliva of this carrier contained huge numbers of beta streptococci. Thirty-five per cent of twenty carriers sneezed out large numbers of alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei. Eighty per cent discharged moderate or large numbers in heavy droplets which fell rapidly to the floor.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !c = Thirty-five per cent of twenty carriers sneezed out large numbers of alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei. Eighty per cent discharged moderate or large numbers in heavy droplets which fell rapidly to the floor.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !d = In the most common pattern (65 per cent of the subjects) few or no beta streptococci were discharged as droplet nuclei, but many were expelled in large droplets captured by the settling plate on the floor 1 1/2 feet from the subject. Fewer than 10 per cent of these large droplets traveled as far as 5 1/2 feet. In a less common pattern, 10 per cent of the subjects, small numbers of droplet nuclei contained beta streptococci but none were collected in large droplets failing on the settling plates. In 20 per cent of the subjects, few or no beta streptococci were recovered at all.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !e = Only one carrier, No. 20, sneezed large numbers of beta streptococci (and also alpha streptococci), both as droplet nuclei and in large droplets falling on all three settling plates. That this subject was really an unusually good atomizer was shown by a second test performed six days after the first. In these two tests he expelled an average of nine beta streptococci per cubic foot per sneeze as droplet nuclei fairly evenly distributed among the three bubblers. In the third experiment the following week his between the sneeze patterns of alpha and output diminished.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !f = Alpha Streptococci and “ Total Bacteria.” In addition to the, beta streptococci, greenforming colonies (salivary streptococci) were usually counted in the pour plates made from bubbler air samples as were the total number of colonies (exclusive of beta streptococci) on the gentian violet blood agar plates exposed on the floor. The numbers of these non-pathogens recovered from the air are presented in  was common, occurring in 35 per cent ofthe subjects. Most of the remaining 65 per cent expelled few or no alphas as dropletnuclei but significant numbers in large droplets. Thus the common and rare patterns but not the less common patternsof beta streptococcus expulsion were reproduced by alpha streptococci.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !g = Of even greater importance is the relative number of bacteria expelled in tiny droplet nuclei as compared with rapidly falling droplets. The fact that 35 per cent of the carriers in this series sneezed large numbersof alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei indicates that expulsion of these tiny nuclei by sneezing is a frequent occurrence.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !h = Uniformity of Distribution of Droplet Nuclei Sneezed into the Experimental Room. Nearly as many droplet nuclei were recovered 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 feet from the sneezer as 1 1/2 feet away. This distribution was in striking contrast with that of the larger droplets, 90 percent of which travelled only 1 1/2 feet.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !i = Persistence of Alpha and Beta Streptococci in air after Sneezing. First, approximately 50 per cent of the number of streptococci collected during sneezing still remained suspended in the air ten to sixteen minutes. Air cultures made in one experiment thirty minutes after the first sneeze, revealed only 5 per cent left. Our findings are in general agreement with those of Bourdillon, Lidwell and Lovelock, who noted that of the total number of air-borne bacteria recovered during the first minute after sneezing, 32 per cent were present fifteen minutes later.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !j = The second point of interest is the sharp change in the distribution of the streptococci on the three settling plates ten to sixteen minutes after sneezing as compared with the sneezing period. During sneezing, about ten times as many streptococci were collected in the nearest settling plate as in either of the other two whereas the three plates exposed ten to sixteen minutes after sneezing recovered approximately equal numbers. This means that the plates in the postsneezing period probably collected particles of the same order of size as did the bubblers during sneezing. Once the rapidly falling droplets had left the air, settling plates collected small droplets or droplet nuclei which had become evenly dispersed throughout the room and settled slowly to the floor.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !k = In the case of most carriers the greatest proportion of the streptococci expelled in saliva during sneezing fall rapidly to the ground and hence do not contaminate the air until they are resuspended as dust. Sneezing, moreover, contributes relatively little to the bacterial reservoirs in dust, bed clothing and elsewhere in the environment because it is not a common symptom in carriers.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !l = In the present study of twenty carriers, only one discharged large numbers of these bacteria as tiny droplet nuclei during violent unbaffled sneezing although of course a carrier such as this one represents a real hazard. He possessed the two important requisites for the expulsion of large numbers of hemolytic streptococcus-containing droplet nuclei during sneezing: an unusually high contamination of the saliva (7,000,OOO per cc.) and a mechanically efficient atomizing capacity.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !m = Since the concentration of alpha (salivary) streptococci per cc. of saliva is remarkably constant from one individual to another, the number of these microorganisms recovered from the air in large droplets or drdplet nuclei during sneezing provides a gobd index of the quality of sneezes.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !n = Coughing does not ordinarily discharge saliva. A cough, because it originates in the back of the throat, disperses the secretions of the pharynx, the secretions of the nose if they have dripped back into the throat or material from below the larynx. This is confirmed bacteriologically by the absence of salivary streptococci from the air into which carriers coughed. The explanation of the failure of 95 per cent of carriers to expel beta streptococci by coughing, even though they were present in large numbers in the throat, is probably that the act of coughing, even volleys of twelve violent coughs, does not ordinarily shear off enough fluid from the mucous membranes of the posterior pharynx to carry significant numbers of these organisms.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !o = One carrier, No. 21, expelled very large numbers, averaging 4 per cubic foot per cough, or 45 per cubic foot during the volley of twelve coughs. Quite large numbers were recovered by both bubblers and plates 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 feet from the cougher. Interestingly enough the air contained no alpha streptococci, indicating that the fluid coughed was not saliva but rather material the other hand, his saliva contained only 38,000 per cc. Further evidence that the saliva is not ordinarily the fluid which comprises cough droplets was the absence of alpha streptococci in the air in nearlyall the other cough tests.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    quote !p = Previous studies have shown that carriers exhibiting positive nose cultures for hemolytic streptococci were more likely to transmit infection than those with positive throat but negative nose cultures. Throat carriers whose nose cultures were negative were also occasionally found to be responsible for secondary cases of streptococcal infection. Carrier No. 20 of this present series, who sneezed very large numbers of hemolytic streptococci, exhibited negative nose cultures at the time of the test although the nose cultures had been positive a few days before. As mentioned in the text his saliva contained an unusually highconcentration of hemolytic streptococci.Such individuals, as well as some of thosedescribed in the earlier investigation of coughing and sneezing,’represent throat carriers who are not innoccuous.

   / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
   quote !q = Talking- Almost no beta (or alpha) streptococci were expelled during talking. ‘No bubbler sample collected as many as one streptococcus per cubic foot, and twenty-nine of the thirty samplers in tests of ten carriers captured none at all. The settling plates likewise were practically free of streptococci, only three of thirty plates exhibiting one colony each.

  // Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses: systematic review
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.39393.510347.BE
  ref 'Jefferson_et_al_2008
    head = Objective: To systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Conclusion: Routine long term implementation of some physical measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult but many simple and low cost interventions could be useful in reducing the spread.

    > Objective
      To systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

    > Data Extraction
      Search strategy of the Cochrane Library, Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, without language restriction, for any intervention to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hygiene). Study designs were randomised trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and controlled before and after studies.

    > Data Synthesis
      Of 2300 titles scanned 138 full papers were retrieved, including 49 papers of 51 studies. Study quality was poor for the three randomised controlled trials and most of the cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of most data except that from six case-control studies. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggest that the spread of respiratory viruses into the community can be prevented by intervening with hygienic measures aimed at younger children. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggests that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52); wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03); wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06); wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41); wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12); and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease the spread of respiratory disease remains uncertain. The lack of proper evaluation of global measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing prevent firm conclusions being drawn.

    > Conclusion
      Routine long term implementation of some physical measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult but many simple and low cost interventions could be useful in reducing the spread.

      In response to increasing concerns about respiratory illness in military recruits, a simple handwashing program was developed and evaluated at a large Navy training center.

    > Methods
      Clinical records from 1996 through 1998 were reviewed to determine weekly rates of respiratory illness before and after program implementation (1,089,800 person-weeks reviewed). A supplemental survey was given to a sample of recruits to assess self-reported respiratory illness and compliance with the handwashing program.

    > Results
      A 45% reduction in total outpatient visits for respiratory illness was observed after implementation of the handwashing program. No change was noted in hospitalization rates for respiratory illness, which remained low during the observation period. Survey data supported clinical observations, as frequent handwashers self-reported fewer respiratory illness episodes when compared to infrequent handwashers. Surveys also revealed challenges with handwashing compliance.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease with a high case-fatality rate and devastating socio-economic impact. In this report we summarized the results from an epidemiological investigation of a SARS outbreak in a hospital in Tianjin, between April and May 2003. We collected epidemiological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of SARS associated with the outbreak. Transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated. The outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters. All SARS cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people. The patients ranged from 16 to 82 years of age (mean age 38·5 years); 38·7% were men. The overall case fatality in the SARS outbreak was 11·7% (13/111). The outbreak lasted around 4 weeks after the index case was identified. SARS is a highly contagious condition associated with substantial case fatality; an outbreak can result from one patient in a relatively short period. However, stringent public health measures seemed to be effective in breaking the disease transmission chain.

    > Background
      There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. We report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 cases of suspected SARS during a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong.

    > Methods
      From March 11 to 25, 2003, all patients with suspected SARS after exposure to an index patient or ward were admitted to the isolation wards of the Prince of Wales Hospital. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

    > Results
      There were 66 male patients and 72 female patients in this cohort, 69 of whom were health care workers. The most common symptoms included fever (in 100 percent of the patients); chills, rigors, or both (73.2 percent); and myalgia (60.9 percent). Cough and headache were also reported in more than 50 percent of the patients. Other common findings were lymphopenia (in 69.6 percent), thrombocytopenia (44.8 percent), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels (71.0 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively). Peripheral air-space consolidation was commonly observed on thoracic computed tomographic scanning. A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04).

    > Conclusions
      SARS is a serious respiratory illness that led to significant morbidity and mortality in our cohort.

Rigor may represent the viremic phase of the disease, which subsided gradually as the illness progressed. In addition, moderate lymphopenia and its subsequent progression, thrombocytopenia, a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels, and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels were prevalent in the early phase of the illness in our cohort; all these findings are quite different from those associated with pneumonia caused by usual bacterial pathogens.

  ref 'Lloyd-Smith_et_al_2005
    head = We present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed.

    > Abstract
      Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous ‘superspreading events’ in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.

    quote !b = Comparing results for eight directly transmitted infections reveals the differing degree of individual variation among diseases and outbreak settings. The Poisson offspring distribution is almost always strongly rejected. The geometric model has considerable support for several data sets, which indicates significant individual variation in transmission rates because real infectious periods are less dispersed than the exponential distribution. The negative binomial model is selected decisively for several data sets, and enables comparative study of diseases through the dispersion parameter.

    quote !f = For outbreaks avoiding stochastic extinction, epidemic growth rates strongly depend on variation in ν. Diseases with high individual variation show infrequent but explosive epidemics after introduction of a single case. This pattern recalls SARS in 2003, for which many settings experienced no epidemic despite unprotected exposure to SARS cases27,28, whereas a few cities suffered explosive outbreaks. Our results, using k̂ = 0.16 for SARS, explain this simply by the presence or absence of high-ν individuals in the early generations of each outbreak6. In contrast, conventional models (with k = 1 or k → ∞) cannot simultaneously generate frequent failed invasions and rapid growth rates without additional, subjective model structure.

    quote !g = We analysed contact tracing data from four outbreaks before and after imposition of control measures. Control always lowered the estimated dispersion parameter (that is k̂c < k̂) as predicted by the individual-specific model, although small sample sizes often led to overlapping confidence intervals. This increased skew in transmission arose chiefly from undiagnosed or misdiagnosed individuals, who continued to infect others (and even cause SSEs), whereas controlled individuals infected very few. To further examine our control theories, we calculated  and  for each data set; k̂c was always closer to , although twice it fell between the two predictions, indicating a possible combination of control mechanisms. Real-world control thus seems to increase individual variation, favouring extinction but risking ongoing SSEs. Larger data sets are needed to establish this pattern definitively.

    quote !h = If highly infectious individuals can be identified predictively (see Supplementary Notes) then the efficiency of control could be greatly increased. Focusing half of all control effort on the most infectious 20% of cases is up to threefold more effective than random control. When k = 0.1 or 0.5, outbreak containment is assured for targeted control levels at roughly half the threshold level of c = 1 - 1/R0 for random control. Gains in efficiency increase with more intense targeting of high-ν cases, but saturate as overall coverage c increases. Again, branching process theory generalizes these findings: for a given proportion c of individuals controlled, greater targeting of higher-ν individuals leads to lower effective reproductive number R and higher extinction probability q

    / November, 2005 - Nature
    quote !i = At a minimum, we propose a new measure for inclusion in outbreak reports: the proportion of cases not transmitting (p0), which, together with R0 is sufficient to estimate the degree of variation in ν. As more data become available, trends may emerge in the degree of variation present, for example, for different modes of spread or levels of virulence. Richer data sets may also enable testing of the branching process assumption that case outcomes are independent and identically distributed, by detecting possible correlations in ν values within transmission lineages or systematic changes as outbreaks progress.

  // Outbreak of Tuberculosis among Regular Patrons of a Neighborhood Bar
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199507273330404
  ref 'Kline_et_al_1995
    head = We report a nonresidential outbreak of tuberculosis that originated in a neighborhood bar.

    > Background
      Outbreaks of tuberculosis have been reported in prisons, nursing homes, urban homeless shelters, and other crowded settings. We report a nonresidential outbreak of tuberculosis that originated in a neighborhood bar.

    > Methods
      A homeless patient with highly infectious pulmonary tuberculosis was a regular patron of a neighborhood bar during a long symptomatic interval before diagnosis. We investigated 97 other regular customers and employees of the bar through interviews, tuberculin skin testing, and chest roentgenography. We performed DNA fingerprinting on isolates from the index patient and 11 other patients.

    > Results
      The index patient apparently infected 41 of 97 contacts (42 percent), resulting in 14 cases of active tuberculosis and 27 cases of infection but no disease (indicated by positive tuberculin skin tests). Four other cases of active tuberculosis occurred among regular customers of the bar who were missed by the contact investigation. There were also two secondary cases. Radiographic findings in active cases included upper-lobe disease in seven cases (three cavitary) and negative chest films at the time of diagnosis in four cases. All 12 culture isolates we tested had the same chromosomal-DNA restriction pattern.

    > Conclusions
      The spread of tuberculosis in a neighborhood bar can be a major public health problem. The high rate of infection and disease among the contacts was unexpected and was not due to coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Possible explanations include heavy alcohol use among the contacts, high infectivity of the index case, or both. Sputum cultures must be performed in tuberculin-positive contacts who have symptoms, even if the chest films are normal.

    > Abstract
      From an analysis of the distributions of measures of transmission rates among hosts, we identify an empirical relationship suggesting that, typically, 20% of the host population contributes at least 80% of the net transmission potential, as measured by the basic reproduction number, R0. This is an example of a statistical pattern known as the 20/80 rule. The rule applies to a variety of disease systems, including vector-borne parasites and sexually transmitted pathogens. The rule implies that control programs targeted at the “core” 20% group are potentially highly effective and, conversely, that programs that fail to reach all of this group will be much less effective than expected in reducing levels of infection in the population as a whole.

This may well apply to other infectious agents where “contact” is less easy to quantify. In practice, additional heterogeneities are also likely to contribute to the effects on R0.

Susceptibility to schistosome infection varies with the nature of contacts, possibly with skin thickness and lipid content and may be related to genetic factors. Risk of STD transmission is affected by the frequency and type of sexual acts and by cofactors. Acquired immunity may also affect host susceptibility to infection (55, 56), but this is not relevant to analyses of R0, which is defined with respect to a fully susceptible (naive) population. The magnitude of the effect of these other heterogeneities at the population level is unknown; but they will not decrease R0 unless negatively correlated with the variables analyzed here.

Such information is not available for behaviors associated with the transmission of either schistosomiasis or STDs.

This has been suggested before, but the novelty of the result lies in the apparent conformity with the 20/80 rule found across widely different host–parasite associations and in the relative magnitude of the contribution to the transmission potential (over 80%) made by a small fraction (20%) of the host population.

What is lacking in public health research into disease control is a quantitative assessment of the relative costs and effects. The 20/80 rule should encourage efforts to make such assessments.

    head = R0 is estimated in order to gauge the relative risk associated with a pathogen. These estimates are then used to compare the transmissibility of the disease to other well-known (and better understood) pathogens. Some time is needed to accrue sufficient incidence data for these estimates of R0, and typically, R0 is only quantified after the epidemic has run its course, or is at least well established.

    > Abstract
      The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.

    head = The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers.

    > Summary
      Early studies that explored host-pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.

  // Pregnancy upregulates angiotensin type 2 receptor expression and increases blood flow in uterine arteries of rats
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioy130
  ref 'Mishra_et_al_2018
    head = This study demonstrates that pregnancy causes a reprogramming of the Ang II receptor expression pattern, resulting in ontogenic increase in uterine arterial AT2R levels that coincides with Ang II increase and relates to the onset and magnitude of uterine blood flow increase in pregnant rats. Estrogens appear to directly upregulate uterine vascular AT2R independent of any endogenous factors. This suggests that local uterine vascular RAS, in addition to central RAS, may play an important role in maintenance of blood flow to the uteroplacental unit.

    > Abstract
      Normal pregnancy is associated with decreased uterine vascular contraction and increased blood flow even though angiotensin II (AngII) levels are increased. AngII not only activates the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) to mediate vasoconstriction but also angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) to cause vasodilation. We hypothesized that upregulation of AT2R expression and function accounts for increased uterine artery blood flow during pregnancy. Virgin, pregnant (at different days of gestation) and post-partum Sprague-Dawley rats were used to determine uterine artery hemodynamics using micro ultrasound and plasma angiotensin II levels by ELISA. Isolated uterine arteries were examined for AT1R and AT2R expression and isometric contraction/relaxation. Plasma AngII levels were steady up to mid-pregnancy, increased as pregnancy advanced, reaching a peak in late pregnancy, and then restored to pre-pregnant levels after delivery. The pattern of increase in AngII levels mirrored a parallel increase in uterine blood flow. AT1R expression did not change, but AT2R expression increased during pregnancy correlating with uterine blood flow increase. Treatment with the AT2R antagonist PD123319 reduced uterine arterial blood flow. Vasoconstriction to angiotensin II was blunted in pregnant rats. Treatment with PD123319 caused greater enhancement of AngII contraction in pregnant than virgin rats. Ex vivo exposure of estradiol to uterine arterial rings dose dependently upregulated AT2R expression, that was inhibited by estrogen receptor antagonist. These results demonstrate that elevated AngII levels during gestation induce an increase in uterine blood flow via heightened AT2R-mediated signaling. Estrogens appear to directly upregulate uterine vascular AT2R independent of any endogenous factors.

Possible mechanisms include modulation of AT2R transcription through estrogen response elements. Although the AT2R promoter does not contain estrogen response elements, estrogen may activate AT2R transcription from alternative response elements such as the activator protein site (AP-1). Intriguingly, estradiol does not upregulate AT2R expression in the lungs and urinary bladder. Why estradiol selectively regulates AT2R expression in certain tissues but not others remain to be clarified.

  ref 'Mansur_et_al_2015
    head = The main finding of this investigation was that patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS who received statin therapy had a significantly better 28-day survival rate compared with those without this therapy. This evidence of a beneficial impact of statin continuation on severe ARDS patients suggests that statin therapy should be continued for all critically ill patients who are at high risk of developing sepsis or infection, i.e., those undergoing surgical procedures with a high infection risk.

    > Background
      Previous investigations have presumed a potential therapeutic effect of statin therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Statins are expected to attenuate inflammation in the lungs of patients with ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical investigations of the role of statin therapy have revealed contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate whether pretreatment and continuous therapy with statins in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS are associated with 28-day survival according to disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe).

    > Methods
      Patients with sepsis-associated ARDS from the surgical intensive care were enrolled in this prospective observational investigation. ARDS was classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe); 28-day mortality was recorded as the primary outcome variable and organ failure was recorded as secondary outcome variable. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the requirements for organ support were evaluated throughout the observational period to assess organ failure.

    > Results
      404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS were enrolled in this investigation. The distribution of the ARDS subgroups was 13 %, 59 %, and 28 % for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Statin therapy improved 28-day survival exclusively in the patients with severe ARDS compared with patients without statin therapy (88.5 % and 62.5 %, respectively; P = 0.0193). To exclude the effects of several confounders, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis, which showed that statin therapy remained a significant covariate for mortality (hazard ratio, 5.46; 95 % CI, 1.38–21.70; P = 0.0156). Moreover, after carrying a propensity score-matching in the severe ARDS cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the improved 28-day survival among patients with statin therapy (P = 0.0205). Patients with severe ARDS who received statin therapy had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those without statin therapy (13 ± 7 and 9 ± 7, respectively; P = 0.0034), and they also required less extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and had more ECMO-free days (18 ± 9 and 15 ± 9, respectively; P = 0.0873).

    > Conclusions
      This investigation suggests a beneficial effect of continuous statin therapy in patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS and a history of prior statin therapy. Further study is warranted to elucidate this potential effect.

  ref 'Pan_et_al_2020
    head = In this cohort study, the institution of interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home quarantine, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey was temporally associated with reduced effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (secondary transmission) and the number of confirmed cases per day across age groups, sex, and geographic regions.

    > Objective
      To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions.

    > Design, Setting and Participants
      In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients’ age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification.

    > Exposures
      Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods.

    > Results
      Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.

    quote !d = Mitigation measures, such as traffic restriction, cancellation of social gatherings, and home quarantine, were associated with a reduction in the degree of transmission. However, despite these interventions, the confirmed case rate continued to increase in the third period, perhaps in part due to shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and delayed diagnosis and access to medical treatment. Without rapid diagnosis, the risk of cross-infection in hospitals was high and patients likely continued to infect family members and close contacts. It has been reported that about 80% of the cluster transmission occurred in families in China.

    quote !e = Centralized quarantine of patients and close contacts appears to have been associated with a reduction in in-hospital, household, and community transmission. Between February 16 and 18, the government further initiated a door-to-door and individual-to-individual universal symptom survey to single out presumptive cases in the community, which was associated with further reductions in the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020358
  ref 'McLeish_et_al_2011
    head = We estimate that almost half the adult population of Scotland were sero-positive for A/H1N1 2009 influenza by early 2010 and that the majority of these individuals (except in the oldest age classes) sero-converted as a result of natural infection with A/H1N1 2009.

    > Background
      Sero-prevalence is a valuable indicator of prevalence and incidence of A/H1N1 2009 infection. However, raw sero-prevalence data must be corrected for background levels of cross-reactivity (i.e. imperfect test specificity) and the effects of immunisation programmes

    > Methods and Findings
      We obtained serum samples from a representative sample of 1563 adults resident in Scotland between late October 2009 and April 2010. Based on a microneutralisation assay, we estimate that 44% (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 40–47%) of the adult population of Scotland were sero-positive for A/H1N1 2009 influenza by 1 March 2010. Correcting for background cross-reactivity and for recorded vaccination rates by time and age group, we estimated that 34% (27–42%) were naturally infected with A/H1N1 2009 by 1 March 2010. The central estimate increases to >40% if we allow for imperfect test sensitivity. Over half of these infections are estimated to have occurred during the study period and the incidence of infection in late October 2009 was estimated at 4.3 new infections per 1000 people per day (1.2 to 7.2), falling close to zero by April 2010. The central estimate increases to over 5.0 per 1000 if we allow for imperfect test specificity. The rate of infection was higher for younger adults than older adults. Raw sero-prevalences were significantly higher in more deprived areas (likelihood ratio trend statistic = 4.92,1 df, P = 0.03) but there was no evidence of any difference in vaccination rates.

    > Conclusions
      We estimate that almost half the adult population of Scotland were sero-positive for A/H1N1 2009 influenza by early 2010 and that the majority of these individuals (except in the oldest age classes) sero-converted as a result of natural infection with A/H1N1 2009. Public health planning should consider the possibility of higher rates of infection with A/H1N1 2009 influenza in more deprived areas.

    > Abstract
      Superspreading events were pivotal in the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We investigated superspreading in one transmission chain early in Beijing’s epidemic. Superspreading was defined as transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts. An index patient with onset of SARS 2 months after hospital admission was the source of four generations of transmission to 76 case-patients, including 12 healthcare workers and several hospital visitors. Four (5%) case circumstances met the superspreading definition. Superspreading appeared to be associated with older age (mean 56 vs. 44 years), case fatality (75% vs. 16%, p = 0.02, Fisher exact test), number of close contacts (36 vs. 0.37) and attack rate among close contacts (43% vs. 18.5%, p < 0.025). Delayed recognition of SARS in a hospitalized patient permitted transmission to patients, visitors, and healthcare workers. Older age and number of contacts merit investigation in future studies of superspreading.

    > Abstract
      The systematic study of large-scale networks has unveiled the ubiquitous presence of connectivity patterns characterized by large-scale heterogeneities and unbounded statistical fluctuations. These features affect dramatically the behavior of the diffusion processes occurring on networks, determining the ensuing statistical properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this article, we present a stochastic computational framework for the forecast of global epidemics that considers the complete worldwide air travel infrastructure complemented with census population data. We address two basic issues in global epidemic modeling: (i) we study the role of the large scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global diffusion pattern of emerging diseases; and (ii) we evaluate the reliability of forecasts and outbreak scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission and traffic flows. To address these issues we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern. These measures may be used for the analysis of containment policies and epidemic risk assessment.

  // Social Contacts and Mixing Patterns Relevant to the Spread of Infectious Diseases
  doi: http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050074
  ref 'Mossong_et_al_2008
    head = The age and intensity patterns of contact are remarkably similar across different European countries even though the average number of contacts recorded differed. This similarity implies that the results may well be applicable to other European countries, and that the initial phase of spread of newly emerging infections in susceptible populations, such as SARS, is likely to be very similar across Europe and in countries with similar social structures.


    > Background
      Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology.

    > Methods and Findings
      7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible.

    > Conclusions
      To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.

  // Networks and epidemic models
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2005.0051
  ref 'Keeling_et_al_2005
    head = Approaches described in this paper thus far have assumed that there is some structure behind social interactions; this structure, the mixing network, determines the relationships that are permitted and the individuals capable of transmitting infection to each other.

    > Abstract
      Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a ‘mixing network’. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks—and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm—have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures.
      Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1007626510002
  ref 'John_et_al_2000
    head = This paper aims at providing a clear understanding of the phenomena herd immunity and herd effect and their relationships which will help improve the design of effective and effcient immunisation programmes aimed at control, elimination or eradication of vaccine preventable infectious diseases.

    > Abstract
      The term herd immunity has been used by various authors to conform to different definitions. Earlier this situation had been identified but not corrected. We propose that it should have precise meaning for which purpose a new definition is offered: “the proportion of subjects with immunity in a given population”. This definition dissociates herd immunity from the indirect protection observed in the unimmunised segment of a population in which a large proportion is immunised, for which the term ‘herd effect’ is proposed. It is defined as: “the reduction of infection or disease in the unimmunised segment as a result of immunising a proportion of the population”. Herd immunity can be measured by testing a sample of the population for the presence of the chosen immune parameter. Herd effect can be measured by quantifying the decline in incidence in the unimmunised segment of a population in which an immunisation programme is instituted. Herd immunity applies to immunisation or infection, human to human transmitted or otherwise. On the other hand, herd effect applies to immunisation or other health interventions which reduce the probability of transmission, confined to infections transmitted human to human, directly or via vector. The induced herd immunity of a given vaccine exhibits geographic variation as it depends upon coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, both of which can vary geographically. Herd effect is determined by herd immunity as well as the force of transmission of the corresponding infection. Clear understanding of these phenomena and their relationships will help improve the design of effective and efficient immunisation programmes aimed at control, elimination or eradication of vaccine preventable infectious diseases.

      The term “herd immunity” is widely used but carries a variety of meanings. Some authors use it to describe the proportion immune among individuals in a population. Others use it with reference to a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in incidence of infection. Still others use it to refer to a pattern of immunity that should protect a population from invasion of a new infection. A common implication of the term is that the risk of infection among susceptible individuals in a population is reduced by the presence and proximity of immune individuals (this is sometimes referred to as “indirect protection” or a “herd effect”). We provide brief historical, epidemiologic, theoretical, and pragmatic public health perspectives on this concept.

This average depends on how the various groups interact and can be calculated from a matrix describing how infection spreads within and between groups. Interactions are often observed to be more frequent within than between groups, in which case the most highly connected groups will dominate transmission, resulting in a higher value of R0, and a larger vaccination threshold than would be obtained by assuming that all individuals display average behavior.

The same effect is found in religious communities that eschew vaccination; though they form only a small proportion of the population, the fact that they often mix selectively with other members of the same community means that they are at an elevated risk of infection.

    > Abstract
      To study the two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 that interdict the transmission pathway for SARS and other respiratory infectious diseases. Two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 were pressed into wafers. One hundred microL 10(6) TCID50/mL SARS-CoV, 100 microL 10(6) PFU/mL recombinant baculovirus expressing hamster's prion protein (haPrP) protein and roughly 10(6) E. coli were slowly dropped onto the surfaces of the catalyst wafers and exposed for 5 and 20 min, respectively. After eluted from the surfaces of wafers, the infectivity of viruses and propagation of bacteria were measured. The expression of PrP protein was determined by Western blot. The morphological changes of bacteria were observed by electronic microscopy. After exposure to the catalysts surfaces for 5 and 20 min, the infectivity of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and baculovirus in Sf9 cells dropped down to a very low and undetectable level, and no colony was detected using bacteria culture method. The expression of haPrP protein reduced to 21.8% in the preparation of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus exposed for 5 min and was undetectable exposed for 20 min. Bacterial membranes seemed to be cracked and the cytoplasm seemed to be effluent from cell bodies. Exposures to the surfaces of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 destroy the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, baculovirus and E. coli. Inactivation ability of metal catalysts needs to interact with air, utilizing oxygen molecules in air. Efficiently killing viruses and bacteria on the surfaces of the two metal catalysts has a promising potential for air-disinfection in hospitals, communities, and households.

    head = Exposure of pediatric patients to copper-surfaced objects in the closed environment of the intensive care unit resulted in decreased HAI(Health care-associated Infections) rates when compared with noncopper exposure; however, the RRR (Relative-Risk reduction) was not statistically significant.

    > BACKGROUND
      Studies have consistently shown that copper alloyed surfaces decrease the burden of microorganisms in health care environments. This study assessed whether copper alloy surfaces decreased hospital-associated infections in pediatric intensive and intermediate care units.

    > METHODS
      Admitted infants were assigned sequentially to a room furnished with or without a limited number of copper alloyed surfaces. Clinical and exposure to intervention data were collected on a daily basis. To avoid counting infections present prior to admission, patients who stayed in the hospital <72 hours were excluded from analysis. Health care-associated infections (HAIs) were confirmed according to protocol definitions.

    > RESULTS
      Clinical outcomes from 515 patients were considered in our analysis: 261 patients from the intervention arm of the study, and 254 from the control arm. Crude analysis showed an HAI rate of 10.6 versus 13.0 per 1,000 patient days for copper- and non-copper-exposed patients, respectively, for a crude relative risk reduction (RRR) of 0.19 (90% confidence interval, 0.46 to -0.22). Conducting clinical trials to assess interventions that may impact HAI rates is very challenging. The results here contribute to our understanding and ability to estimate the effect size that copper alloy surfaces have on HAI acquisition.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      Exposure of pediatric patients to copper-surfaced objects in the closed environment of the intensive care unit resulted in decreased HAI rates when compared with noncopper exposure; however, the RRR was not statistically significant. The clinical effect size warrants further consideration of this intervention as a component of a systems-based approach to control HAIs.

The placement of copper alloy components, in the built environment, may have the potential to reduce not only hospital-acquired infections but also patient treatment costs.

    > Background
      There are indications that bacteria found on frequently touched environmental surfaces play a role in infection transmission.

    > Methods
      In laboratory testing, copper alloy samples were inoculated with bacteria. In clinical trials, the amount of live bacteria on the surfaces of hospital components made of copper alloys, as well as those made from standard materials, was measured. Finally, infection rates were tracked in the hospital rooms with the copper components and compared to those found in the rooms containing the standard components.

    > Results
      Greater than a 99.9% reduction in live bacteria was realized in laboratory tests. In the clinical trials, an 83% reduction in bacteria was seen on the copper alloy components, when compared to the surfaces made from standard materials in the control rooms. Finally, the infection rates were found to be reduced by 58% in patient rooms with components made of copper, when compared to patients' rooms with components made of standard materials.

    > Conclusion
      Bacteria die on copper alloy surfaces in both the laboratory and the hospital rooms. Infection rates were lowered in those hospital rooms containing copper components.

    > Abstract
      The evolution of new and reemerging historic virulent strains of respiratory viruses from animal reservoirs is a significant threat to human health. Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses that emerged in humans at the beginning of the 21st century. Both viruses likely originated in bats, and genetically diverse coronaviruses that are related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered in bats worldwide. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of these two pathogenic coronaviruses and discuss their receptor usage; we also highlight the diversity and potential of spillover of bat-borne coronaviruses, as evidenced by the recent spillover of swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) to pigs.

      Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating clinical condition associated with pulmonary and systemic inflammation and characterized by incompetence of the pulmonary microvascular barrier culminating in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying endothelial barrier dysfunction in ALI has been facilitated by study of the effects of statins in relevant cellular and animals models. Many of the pleotropic properties of these drugs, including direct effects on endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeletal rearrangement, NADPH oxidase, and nitric oxide activity, as well as effects on differential EC gene expression, are relevant to the pathobiology of ALI and suggest a potential therapeutic role for statins in this context. Moreover, results from preclinical studies and observations in relevant patient populations support the protective potential of statins in ALI, paving the way now for definitive clinical trials.

    > Abstract
      Influenza viruses are a major pathogen of both humans and animals. Recent studies using gene-knockout mice have led to an in-depth understanding of the innate sensors that detect influenza virus infection in a variety of cell types. Signalling downstream of these sensors induces distinct sets of effector mechanisms that block virus replication and promote viral clearance by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we discuss the various ways in which the innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors to detect and respond to influenza virus infection. We consider whether the outcome of innate sensor stimulation promotes antiviral resistance or disease tolerance, and propose rational treatment strategies for the acute respiratory disease that is caused by influenza virus infection.

  ref 'Pillai_et_al_2016
    head = Data indicate that a failure to induce type I IFNs promotes viral amplification and tissue damage within the respiratory environment, conducive to bacterial bloom. Neutrophil recruitment and caspase-dependent NETosis contributes to lethality. These results in Mx1 congenic mice are consistent with the notion that age-related defects in innate immunity (reduced IFN responses) could predispose IAV-infected older adults to secondary bacterial infection. A direct implication of our findings is that older adults suffering from IAV infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that minimize inflammatory responses mediated by neutrophils.

    > Abstract
      Influenza A virus (IAV) causes up to half a million deaths worldwide annually, 90% of which occur in older adults. We show that IAV-infected monocytes from older humans have impaired antiviral interferon production but retain intact inflammasome responses. To understand the in vivo consequence, we used mice expressing a functional Mx gene encoding a major interferon-induced effector against IAV in humans. In Mx1-intact mice with weakened resistance due to deficiencies in Mavs and Tlr7, we found an elevated respiratory bacterial burden. Notably, mortality in the absence of Mavs and Tlr7 was independent of viral load or MyD88-dependent signaling but dependent on bacterial burden, caspase-1/11, and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. Therefore, in the context of weakened antiviral resistance, vulnerability to IAV disease is a function of caspase-dependent pathology.

  // The Pore-Forming Protein Gasdermin D Regulates Interleukin-1 Secretion from Living Macrophages
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2017.11.013
  ref 'Evavold_et_al_2017
    head = We report that GSDMD is required for IL-1 release under conditions of macrophage hyperactivation and under pyroptosis-inducing conditions where plasma membrane rupture is experimentally prevented. Using reconstituted 293T cells and liposome-based analyses, we provide evidence that GSDMD pores serve as conduits for the transport of IL-1 family cytokines across intact lipid bilayers.

    > Abstract
      The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are cytosolic proteins that exhibit inflammatory activity upon release into the extracellular space. These factors are released following various cell death processes, with pyroptosis being a common mechanism. Recently, it was recognized that phagocytes can achieve a state of hyperactivation, which is defined by their ability to secrete IL-1 while retaining viability, yet it is unclear how IL-1 can be secreted from living cells. Herein, we report that the pyroptosis regulator gasdermin D (GSDMD) was necessary for IL-1β secretion from living macrophages that have been exposed to inflammasome activators, such as bacteria and their products or host-derived oxidized lipids. Cell- and liposome-based assays demonstrated that GSDMD pores were required for IL-1β transport across an intact lipid bilayer. These findings identify a non-pyroptotic function for GSDMD, and raise the possibility that GSDMD pores represent conduits for the secretion of cytosolic cytokines under conditions of cell hyperactivation.

    quote !a = Central to our working hypothesis is that hyperactive cells are alive. In this study, we provided additional data to support this claim, as live cell microscopy revealed hyperactive cells containing inflammasomes, and most of these cells maintained mitochondrial and phagocytic activity. This ability to maintain biological activities after inflammasome assembly is a hallmark of cell viability and supports our conclusion that hyperactivating stimuli induce IL-1 release from living cells.

  // Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.006
  ref 'Xie_et_al_2018
    head =  Our data support that the S358 (highly conserved serine residue) replacement in bat STING dampened but did not fully diminish the functionality of STING. The nature of the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of “effective response” but not “over response” against viruses

    > Abstract
      Compared with terrestrial mammals, bats have a longer lifespan and greater capacity to co-exist with a variety of viruses. In addition to cytosolic DNA generated by these viral infections, the metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage and the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether bats have an altered DNA sensing/defense system to balance high cytosolic DNA levels remains an open question. We demonstrate that bats have a dampened interferon response due to the replacement of the highly conserved serine residue (S358) in STING, an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways. Reversing this mutation by introducing S358 restored STING functionality, resulting in interferon activation and virus inhibition. Combined with previous reports on bat-specific changes of other DNA sensors such as TLR9, IFI16, and AIM2, our findings shed light on bat adaptation to flight, their long lifespan, and their unique capacity to serve as a virus reservoir.

Instead, this residue has been replaced by a variety of different residues at this position, including N, H, F, Y, P, D, and R. As the S358 phosphorylation site is critical for downstream IFN activation in humans and other mammals (Liu et al., 2015, Tanaka and Chen, 2012, Tsuchida et al., 2010, Zhong et al., 2008), this key residue change strongly suggests a weakened bat STING in the context of IFN activation.

      Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight and are notorious reservoir hosts for some of the world's most highly pathogenic viruses, including Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To identify genetic changes associated with the development of bat-specific traits, we performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative analyses of two distantly related species, fruit bat Pteropus alecto and insectivorous bat Myotis davidii. We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor κB pathways that may be related to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction of important gene families. Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian species has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution.

    > Abstract
      Bats are unique among mammals given their ability to fly, apparent tolerance of deadly viruses and extraordinary longevity. We propose that these traits are linked and driven by adaptations of the innate immune system. To explore this hypothesis we challenged macrophages from the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis and the house mouse, Mus musculus with toll like receptors (TLRs) ligands, lipopolysaccharides, LPS and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, Poly(I:C). Macrophages from both species presented a high level of mRNA induction of inferon β (INF-β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1β (Il-1β). However, in bat macrophages, this antiviral, proinflammatory response was balanced by a sustained high-level transcription of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-10, which was not observed in mouse, potentially resulting from adaptive regulation in bats. Additionally, phylogenomic selection tests across the basal divergences in mammals (n = 39) uncovered bat-specific adaptations in six genes involved in antiviral and proinflammatory signalling. Based on this pilot study, we put forward a hypothesis that bats may have evolved unique anti-inflammatory responses to neutralize proinflammatory stimuli resulting from flight. This in turn may drive their extraordinary longevity and viral tolerance by limiting inflammation driven ageing and infection-induced immunopathology. Further data from other individuals and bat species are required to advance this intriguing hypothesis.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115736
  ref 'Najjar_et_al_2015
    head = Results indicate that the unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.

    > Abstract
      Bats of different species play a major role in the emergence and transmission of highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola virus, SARS-like coronavirus and the henipaviruses. These viruses require proteolytic activation of surface envelope glycoproteins needed for entry, and cellular cathepsins have been shown to be involved in proteolysis of glycoproteins from these distinct virus families. Very little is currently known about the available proteases in bats. To determine whether the utilization of cathepsins by bat-borne viruses is related to the nature of proteases in their natural hosts, we examined proteolytic processing of several viral fusion proteins in cells derived from two fruit bat species, Pteropus alecto and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our work shows that fruit bat cells have homologs of cathepsin and furin proteases capable of cleaving and activating both the cathepsin-dependent Hendra virus F and the furin-dependent parainfluenza virus 5 F proteins. Sequence analysis comparing Pteropus alecto furin and cathepsin L to proteases from other mammalian species showed a high degree of conservation; however significant amino acid variation occurs at the C-terminus of Pteropus alecto furin. Further analysis of furin-like proteases from fruit bats revealed that these proteases are catalytically active and resemble other mammalian furins in their response to a potent furin inhibitor. However, kinetic analysis suggests that differences may exist in the cellular localization of furin between different species. Collectively, these results indicate that the unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.

    > Abstract
      A majority of viruses that have caused recent epidemics with high lethality rates in people, are zoonoses originating from wildlife. Among them are filoviruses (e.g., Marburg, Ebola), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), henipaviruses (e.g., Hendra, Nipah) which share the common features that they are all RNA viruses, and that a dysregulated immune response is an important contributor to the tissue damage and hence pathogenicity that results from infection in humans. Intriguingly, these viruses also all originate from bat reservoirs. Bats have been shown to have a greater mean viral richness than predicted by their phylogenetic distance from humans, their geographic range, or their presence in urban areas, suggesting other traits must explain why bats harbor a greater number of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signaling pathways. Do our life history traits make us susceptible to generating damaging immune responses to RNA viruses or does the physiology of bats make them particularly tolerant or resistant? Understanding what immune mechanisms enable bats to coexist with RNA viruses may provide critical fundamental insights into how to achieve greater resilience in humans.

    > Abstract
      In recent years viruses similar to those that appear to cause no overt disease in bats have spilled-over to humans and other species causing serious disease. Since pathology in such diseases is often attributed to an over-active inflammatory response, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells respond to stimulation of their receptors for viral ligands with a strong antiviral response, but unlike in human cells, the inflammatory response is not overtly activated. We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNFα, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation. We examined the bat TNFα promoter and found a potential repressor (c-Rel) binding motif. We demonstrated that c-Rel binds to the putative c-Rel motif in the promoter and knocking down c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNFα transcripts. Our results suggest bats may have a unique mechanism to suppress inflammatory pathology.

    > Abstract
      The discovery of SARS-like coronavirus in bats suggests that bats could be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. However, previous studies indicated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a known SARS-CoV receptor, from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays. The results show that ACE2s of Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus support viral entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, albeit with different efficiency in comparison to that of the human ACE2. Further, the alteration of several key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ACE2 receptor efficiency, as predicted from a structural modeling study of the different bat ACE2 molecules. These data suggest that M. daubentoni and R. sinicus are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV and may be candidates as the natural host of the SARS-CoV progenitor viruses. Furthermore, our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ACE2 among bats is greater than that observed among known SARS-CoV susceptible mammals, highlighting the possibility that there are many more uncharacterized bat species that can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV or its progenitor viruses. This calls for continuation and expansion of field surveillance studies among different bat populations to eventually identify the true natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.

  ref 'Sarnak_et_al_2001
    head = Patients with ESRD (end-stage renal disease) treated with dialysis have higher pulmonary infectious mortality rates compared with the GP (General Population), even after stratification for age, race, and DM (diabetes mellitus). Consequently, this patient population must be considered at high risk for the development of lethal pulmonary infections.

    > Background
      Infection is the second-leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This is due in part to advanced age, comorbid conditions, and immune dysfunction observed in uremic states. Although one may hypothesize that pulmonary infectious mortality is higher among patients with ESRD compared with the general population (GP), no such data are currently available.

    > Methods
      We compared annual pulmonary infectious mortality rates among patients with ESRD to those in the GP. The data were abstracted from the United States Renal Data System and the National Center for Health Statistics, respectively, and were stratified by age, gender, race, and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus (DM). In the GP, primary and multiple cause-of-death analyses were performed to account for potential limitations of the data sources.

    > Results
      Overall, pulmonary infectious mortality rate was 14-fold to 16-fold higher in dialysis patients and approximately twofold higher in renal transplant recipients compared with the GP. After stratification for age, differences between groups decreased but retained their magnitude.

    > Conclusion
      Patients with ESRD treated with dialysis have higher pulmonary infectious mortality rates compared with the GP, even after stratification for age, race, and DM. Consequently, this patient population must be considered at high risk for the development of lethal pulmonary infections.

We fitted a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 5·6 days (95% CI 4·8–6·3) for adenovirus, 3·2 days (95% CI 2·8–3·7) for human coronavirus, 4·0 days (95% CI 3·6–4·4) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 1·4 days (95% CI 1·3–1·5) for influenza A, 0·6 days (95% CI 0·5–0·6) for influenza B, 12·5 days (95% CI 11·8–13·3) for measles, 2·6 days (95% CI 2·1–3·1) for parainfluenza, 4·4 days (95% CI 3·9–4·9) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1·9 days (95% CI 1·4–2·4) for rhinovirus. When using the incubation period, it is important to consider its full distribution: the right tail for quarantine policy, the central regions for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning. Our estimates combine published data to give the detail necessary for these and other applications.

  // The reachability of contagion in temporal contact networks: how disease latency can exploit the rhythm of human behavior
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3117-6
  ref 'Colman_et_al_2018
    head = The reproductive potential of pathogens is linked inextricably to the host social behavior required for transmission.

    > Background
      The symptoms of many infectious diseases influence their host to withdraw from social activity limiting their potential to spread. Successful transmission therefore requires the onset of infectiousness to coincide with a time when the host is socially active. Since social activity and infectiousness are both temporal phenomena, we hypothesize that diseases are most pervasive when these two processes are synchronized.

    > Methods
      We consider disease dynamics that incorporate behavioral responses that effectively shorten the infectious period of the pathogen. Using data collected from face-to-face social interactions and synthetic contact networks constructed from empirical demographic data, we measure the reachability of this disease model and perform disease simulations over a range of latent period durations.

    > Results
      We find that maximum transmission risk results when the disease latent period (and thus the generation time) are synchronized with human circadian rhythms of 24 h, and minimum transmission risk when latent periods are out of phase with circadian rhythms by 12 h. The effect of this synchronization is present for a range of disease models with realistic disease parameters and host behavioral responses.

    > Conclusions
      The reproductive potential of pathogens is linked inextricably to the host social behavior required for transmission. We propose that future work should consider contact periodicity in models of disease dynamics, and suggest the possibility that disease control strategies may be designed to optimize against the effects of synchronization.

    > Summary
      After preliminary trials, the detailed changes in the concentration of specific circulating and local antibodies were followed in 15 volunteers inoculated with coronavirus 229E. Ten of them, who had significantly lower concentrations of pre-existing antibody than the rest, became infected and eight of these developed colds. A limited investigation of circulating lymphocyte populations showed some lymphocytopenia in infected volunteers. In this group, antibody concentrations started to increase 1 week after inoculation and reached a maximum about 1 week later. Thereafter antibody titres slowly declined. Although concentrations were still slightly raised 1 year later, this did not always prevent reinfection when volunteers were then challenged with the homologous virus. However, the period of virus shedding was shorter than before and none developed a cold. All of the uninfected group were infected on re-challenge although they also appeared to show some resistance to disease and in the extent of infection. These results are discussed with reference to natural infections with coronavirus and with other infections, such as rhinovirus infections.

      A seroepidemiologic study of infection by coronavirus strains 229E, OC38, OC43, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A-59, is described. In adults with upper respiratory disease, two “outbreaks” of coronavirus infection occurred, one during the winter of 1965–1966 associated with complement fixing (CF) antibody responses to OC38, OC43 and MHV, and the other during the following winter associated with CF antibody responses to 229E. In hospitalized children, infection with 229E was rare; infection with OC38, OC43, and MHV occurred less often in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract disease (3.5%) than in a control group with non-respiratory tract disease (8.2%). The limitations of the CF test using available coronavirus antigens are discussed.

    > Background
      Following the outbreaks of 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection, rapid influenza diagnostic tests have been used to detect H1N1 infection. However, no meta‐analysis has been undertaken to assess the diagnostic accuracy when this manuscript was drafted.

    > Methods
      The literature was systematically searched to identify studies that reported the performance of rapid tests. Random effects meta‐analyses were conducted to summarize the overall performance.

    > Results
      Seventeen studies were selected with 1879 cases and 3477 non‐cases. The overall sensitivity and specificity estimates of the rapid tests were 0·51 (95%CI: 0·41, 0·60) and 0·98 (95%CI: 0·94, 0·99). Studies reported heterogeneous sensitivity estimates, ranging from 0·11 to 0·88. If the prevalence was 30%, the overall positive and negative predictive values were 0·94 (95%CI: 0·85, 0·98) and 0·82 (95%CI: 0·79, 0·85). The overall specificities from different manufacturers were comparable, while there were some differences for the overall sensitivity estimates. BinaxNOW had a lower overall sensitivity of 0·39 (95%CI: 0·24, 0·57) compared with all the others (P‐value <0·001), whereas QuickVue had a higher overall sensitivity of 0·57 (95%CI: 0·50, 0·63) compared with all the others (P‐value = 0·005).

    > Abstract
      Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a variety of viruses and bacteria, which can be conveniently detected by multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). To compare the novel Luminex‐based NxTAG‐Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG‐RPP) with the routine multiplex‐ligation‐NAT based RespiFinder‐22® (RF‐22), 282 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs (71%), broncho‐alveolar lavage (27%), throat swabs, tracheal secretions, and sputum (2%) from 116 children and 155 adults were extracted using a Corbett CAS1200 (Qiagen), and analyzed in parallel by the routine RF‐22 and NxTAG‐RPP. Concordant results were obtained in 263 (93.3%) cases consisting of concordant positives in 167 (59.2%) and concordant negatives in 96 (34%). Results were discordant in 19 (6.7%) consisting of 15 positive:negative, and 4 negative:positive results by NxTAG‐RPP versus RF‐22, respectively. Co‐infections were observed in 10.3% with NxTAG‐RPP and in 5.9% with RF‐22. Most additional viral pathogens identified by the NxTAG‐RPP involved dual infections with rhinovirus and RSV. Discordant samples were mainly due to low genome signals of Ct less than 36, when retested by QNAT suggesting a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG‐RPP, also when detecting multiple infections. Hands‐on time after extraction for 24 and 96 samples was 0.25 and <0.5 hr for the NxTAG‐RPP, and 2 and 4 hr for the RF‐22, respectively. The median turn‐around time was 6 hr (range 5–7 hr) for NxTAG‐RPP and 12 hr (range 8–16 hr) for RF‐22. The NxTAG‐RPP showed comparable detection rates for most respiratory pathogens, while hands‐on and turn‐around time were considerably shorter. The clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses needs further clinical evaluation.

    head = Three commercial mPCR systems—FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and GenProbe Prodesse ProFlu+—may provide important diagnostic information to help early identification of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and hMPV.

    > Objectives
      To provide a summary of evidence for the diagnostic accuracies of three multiplex PCR systems (mPCRs)—BioFire FilmArray RP (FilmArray), Nanosphere Verigene RV+ test (Verigene RV+) and Hologic Gen-Probe Prodesse assays—on the detection of viral respiratory infections.

    > Methods
      A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay.

    > Results
      Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+ (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848–0.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882–0.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871–0.985), respectively. The three mPCRs were comparable in terms of detection of FluA.

    > Conclusions
      Point estimates calculated from eligible studies showed that the three mPCRs (FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+) are highly accurate and may provide important diagnostic information for early identification of respiratory virus infections. In patients with low pretest probability for FluA, these three mPCRs can predict a low possibility of infection and may justify withholding empirical antiviral treatments.

    > Abstract
      The performance of the new ePlex Respiratory Pathogen (RP) panel (GenMark Diagnostics) for the simultaneous detection of 19 viruses (influenza A virus; influenza A H1 virus; influenza A 2009 H1 virus; influenza A H3 virus; influenza B virus; adenovirus; coronaviruses [HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E]; human rhinovirus/enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] [RSV subtype A and RSV subtype B]) and 2 bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae) was evaluated. Prospectively and retrospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens (n = 2,908) were evaluated by using the ePlex RP panel, with the bioMérieux/BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire RP) as the comparator method. Discordance analysis was performed by using target-specific PCRs and bidirectional sequencing. The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated by using reproducibility panels comprised of 6 pathogens. The overall agreement between the ePlex RP and BioFire RP results was >95% for all targets. Positive percent agreement with the BioFire RP result for viruses ranged from 85.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2% to 88.9%) to 95.1% (95% CI, 89.0% to 97.9%), while negative percent agreement values ranged from 99.5% (95% CI, 99.1% to 99.7%) to 99.8% (95% CI, 99.5% to 99.9%). Additional testing of discordant targets (12%; 349/2,908) confirmed the results of ePlex RP for 38% (131/349) of samples tested. Reproducibility was 100% for all targets tested, with the exception of adenovirus, for which reproducibilities were 91.6% at low virus concentrations and 100% at moderate virus concentrations. The ePlex RP panel offers a new, rapid, and sensitive “sample-to-answer” multiplex panel for the detection of the most common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens.

    head = We demonstrate rapid spread of ZIKV in Salvador, Brazil, and infection rates exceeding 60%. We provide evidence for the link between ZIKV and microcephaly, report that ZIKV predominantly affects geographic areas with low socioeconomic status, and show that population immunity likely caused cessation of the outbreak.

    > Abstract
      During 2015 to 2016, Brazil reported more Zika virus (ZIKV) cases than any other country, yet population exposure remains unknown. Serological studies of ZIKV are hampered by cross-reactive immune responses against heterologous viruses. We conducted serosurveys for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in 633 individuals prospectively sampled during 2015 to 2016, including microcephaly and non-microcephaly pregnancies, HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis patients, and university staff in Salvador in northeastern Brazil using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and plaque reduction neutralization tests. Sera sampled retrospectively during 2013 to 2015 from 277 HIV-infected patients were used to assess the spread of ZIKV over time. Individuals were georeferenced, and sociodemographic indicators were compared between ZIKV-positive and -negative areas and areas with and without microcephaly cases. Epidemiological key parameters were modeled in a Bayesian framework. ZIKV seroprevalence increased rapidly during 2015 to 2016, reaching 63.3% by 2016 (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.4 to 66.8%), comparable to the seroprevalence of DENV (75.7%; CI, 69.4 to 81.1%) and higher than that of CHIKV (7.4%; CI, 5.6 to 9.8%). Of 19 microcephaly pregnancies, 94.7% showed ZIKV IgG antibodies, compared to 69.3% of 257 non-microcephaly pregnancies (P = 0.017). Analyses of sociodemographic data revealed a higher ZIKV burden in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas. High seroprevalence, combined with case data dynamics allowed estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 of 2.1 (CI, 1.8 to 2.5) at the onset of the outbreak and an effective reproductive number Reff of <1 in subsequent years. Our data corroborate ZIKV-associated congenital disease and an association of low SES and ZIKV infection and suggest that population immunity caused cessation of the outbreak. Similar studies from other areas will be required to determine the fate of the American ZIKV outbreak.

    head = “Inflamm‐aging,” is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. Thus, the beneficial effect of the defense system network (innate immunity, stress, and inflammation), devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood, turns out to be detrimental late in life, in a period largely not foreseen by evolution. Similar phenomena have been predicted by evolutionary geneticists who proposed the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.

    > Abstract
      In this paper we extend the “network theory of aging,” and we argue that a global reduction in the capacity to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status are major characteristics of the aging process. This phenomenon, which we will refer to as “inflamm‐aging,” is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. On the basis of evolutionary studies, we also argue that the immune and the stress responses are equivalent and that antigens are nothing other than particular types of stressors. We also propose to return macrophage to its rightful place as central actor not only in the inflammatory response and immunity, but also in the stress response. The rate of reaching the threshold of proinflammatory status over which diseases/disabilities ensue and the individual capacity to cope with and adapt to stressors are assumed to be complex traits with a genetic component. Finally, we argue that the persistence of inflammatory stimuli over time represents the biologic background (first hit) favoring the susceptibility to age‐related diseases/disabilities. A second hit (absence of robust gene variants and/or presence of frail gene variants) is likely necessary to develop overt organ‐specific age‐related diseases having an inflammatory pathogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Following this perspective, several paradoxes of healthy centenarians (increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and coagulation factors) are illustrated and explained. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.

  ref 'Jing_et_al_2009
    head = Aging was associated with decline in pDC (plasmacytoid dendritic cells), but not mDC (myeloid dendritic cells), in healthy young versus elderly subject group comparisons, while declining health in the elderly can profoundly impact mDC negatively. Because of the importance of pDC for antiviral responses, the age-related changes in pDC likely contribute to the impaired immune response to viral infections in elderly persons, especially when combined with the mDC dysfunction occurring in those with compromised health. These findings support the strategy of targeting pDC for immune modulation to enhance vaccine efficacy in healthy elderly populations.

    > Abstract
      Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells that initiate and regulate T-cell responses. In this study, the numbers and functional cytokine secretions of plasmacytoid and myeloid DC (pDC and mDC, respectively) in peripheral blood from young and elderly subjects were compared. Overall, pDC numbers in peripheral blood were lower in healthy elderly compared with healthy young subjects (p = 0.016). In response to influenza virus stimulation, isolated pDC from healthy elderly subjects secreted less interferon (IFN)–α compared with those from healthy young subjects. The decline in IFN-α secretion was associated with a reduced proportion of pDC that expressed Toll-like receptor–7 or Toll-like receptor-9. In contrast, there was little difference in the numbers and cytokine secretion function between healthy young and healthy elderly subjects (p = 0.82). However, in peripheral blood from frail elderly subjects, the numbers of mDC were severely depleted as compared with either healthy young or elderly subjects (p = 0.014 and 0.007, respectively). Thus, aging was associated with the numerical and functional decline in pDC, but not mDC, in healthy young versus elderly subject group comparisons, while declining health in the elderly can profoundly impact mDC negatively. Because of the importance of pDC for antiviral responses, the age-related changes in pDC likely contribute to the impaired immune response to viral infections in elderly persons, especially when combined with the mDC dysfunction occurring in those with compromised health.

    head = Induction of type I IFN is a key feature of the innate immune antiviral response. Our results identify deficits in critical regulatory pathways in the antiviral response that may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to viral infections observed in aging.

    > Abstract
      West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA flavivirus, causes significant human morbidity and mortality in the older population; thus, we investigated the effects of aging on infection with WNV in dendritic cells (DCs). We infected DCs with WNV in vitro and quantified cytokines and chemokines (type I IFN and CXCL10), pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I, and Toll-like receptors 3 and 7. The production of type I IFN was significantly lower in DCs from older donors, compared with younger donors. Although we observed no significant age-related difference in expression or nuclear translocation of signaling molecules in initial antiviral responses, DCs from older donors have diminished induction of late-phase responses (eg, STAT1, IRF7, and IRF1), suggesting defective regulation of type I IFN. Our results identify deficits in critical regulatory pathways in the antiviral response that may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to viral infections observed in aging.

    head = We reappraised the various arguments pointing to the presence of innate immune memory in plants, lower animals, and vertebrates. We defined trained immunity as a nonspecific immunological memory resulting from rewiring the epigenetic program and the functional state of the innate immune system, eventually resulting in protection against secondary infections. We also compared data assessing the mechanisms of tolerance and trained immunity.

    > Abstract
      The general view that only adaptive immunity can build immunological memory has recently been challenged. In organisms lacking adaptive immunity, as well as in mammals, the innate immune system can mount resistance to reinfection, a phenomenon termed “trained immunity” or “innate immune memory.” Trained immunity is orchestrated by epigenetic reprogramming, broadly defined as sustained changes in gene expression and cell physiology that do not involve permanent genetic changes such as mutations and recombination, which are essential for adaptive immunity. The discovery of trained immunity may open the door for novel vaccine approaches, new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of immune deficiency states, and modulation of exaggerated inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases.

  // Substantial Impact of School Closure on the Transmission Dynamics during the Pandemic Flu H1N1-2009 in Oita, Japan
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144839
  ref 'Kawano_et_al_2015
    head = School closure was an effective intervention for mitigating the spread of influenza and should be implemented for more than 4 days. School closure has a remarkable impact on decreasing the number of infected students at the peak, but it does not substantially decrease the total number of infected students.

    > Background
      School closure is considered as an effective measure to prevent pandemic influenza. Although Japan has implemented many class, grade, and whole school closures during the early stage of the pandemic 2009, the effectiveness of such a school closure has not been analysed appropriately. In addition, analysis based on evidence or data from a large population has yet to be performed. We evaluated the preventive effect of school closure against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and examined efficient strategies of reactive school closure.

    > Materials and Methods
      Data included daily reports of reactive school closures and the number of infected students in the pandemic in Oita City, Japan. We used a regression model that incorporated a time delay to analyse the daily data of school closure based on a time continuous susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model of infectious disease spread. The delay was due to the time-lag from transmission to case reporting. We simulated the number of students infected daily with and without school closure and evaluated the effectiveness.

    > Results
      The model with a 3-day delay from transmission to reporting yielded the best fit using R2 (the coefficient of determination). This result suggests that the recommended period of school closure is more than 4 days. Moreover, the effect of school closure in the simulation of school closure showed the following: the number of infected students decreased by about 24% at its peak, and the number of cumulative infected students decreased by about 8.0%.

    > Conclusions
      School closure was an effective intervention for mitigating the spread of influenza and should be implemented for more than 4 days. School closure has a remarkable impact on decreasing the number of infected students at the peak, but it does not substantially decrease the total number of infected students.

  // School closure policies at municipality level for mitigating influenza spread: a modelbased evaluation
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1918-z
  ref 'Ciavarella_et_al_2016
    head = Our simulation results suggest that reactive school closure policies based on student absenteeism are applicable in real-world situations and can be highly effective in mitigating influenza spread in the case of pandemics/epidemics characterized by features (e.g., reproduction number and age-specific susceptibility to infection) comparable to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

    > Background
      Nearly every year Influenza affects most countries worldwide and the risk of a new pandemic is always present. Therefore, influenza is a major concern for public health. School-age individuals are often the most affected group, suggesting that the inclusion in preparedness plans of school closure policies may represent an option for influenza mitigation. However, their applicability remains uncertain and their implementation should carefully be weighed on the basis of cost-benefit considerations.

    > Methods
      We developed an individual-based model for influenza transmission integrating data on sociodemography and time use of the Italian population, face-to-face contacts in schools, and influenza natural history. The model was calibrated on the basis of epidemiological data from the 2009 influenza pandemic and was used to evaluate the effectiveness of three reactive school closure strategies, all based on school absenteeism.

    > Results
      In the case of a new influenza pandemic sharing similar features with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, gradual school closure strategies (i.e., strategies closing classes first, then grades or the entire school) could lead to attack rate reduction up to 20–25 % and to peak weekly incidence reduction up to 50–55 %, at the cost of about three school weeks lost per student. Gradual strategies are quite stable to variations in the start of policy application and to the threshold on student absenteeism triggering class (and school) closures. In the case of a new influenza pandemic showing different characteristics with respect to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, we found that the most critical features determining the effectiveness of school closure policies are the reproduction number and the age-specific susceptibility to infection, suggesting that these two epidemiological quantities should be estimated early on in the spread of a new pandemic for properly informing response planners.

    > Conclusions
      Our results highlight a potential beneficial effect of reactive gradual school closure policies in mitigating influenza spread, conditioned on the effort that decision makers are willing to afford. Moreover, the suggested strategies are solely based on routinely collected and easily accessible data (such as student absenteeism irrespective of the cause and ILI incidence) and thus they appear to be applicable in real world situations.

  // Strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04795
  ref 'Fergusion_et_al_2006
    head = Household quarantine is potentially the most effective social distance measure, but only if compliance with the policy is good. Reactive school closure has limited impact on overall attack rates, but can enhance other policies. For the high transmissibility scenario only policies using >99% border controls can delay spread by enough to enable pandemic vaccine to reduce attack rates substantially.

    > Abstract
      Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2–3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40–50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.

  // Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Implemented by US Cities During the 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic
  doi: http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.298.6.644
  ref 'Market_et_al_2007
    head = The earlier that schools were closed (ideally even in advance of outbreaks) the lower the number of excess deaths in 43 US cities during the 1918 Influenza pandemic. The longer that school closings and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were applied in each of 43 US cities during the 1918 influenza pandemic, the lower was the ultimate mortality rate.

    > Context
      A critical question in pandemic influenza planning is the role nonpharmaceutical interventions might play in delaying the temporal effects of a pandemic, reducing the overall and peak attack rate, and reducing the number of cumulative deaths. Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication production and distribution. Optimally, appropriate implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions would decrease the burden on health care services and critical infrastructure.

    > Objectives
      To examine the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions for epidemic mitigation in 43 cities in the continental United States from September 8, 1918, through February 22, 1919, and to determine whether city-to-city variation in mortality was associated with the timing, duration, and combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions; altered population susceptibility associated with prior pandemic waves; age and sex distribution; and population size and density.

    > Design and Setting
      Historical archival research, and statistical and epidemiological analyses. Nonpharmaceutical interventions were grouped into 3 major categories: school closure; cancellation of public gatherings; and isolation and quarantine.

    > Main Outcome Measures
      Weekly excess death rate (EDR); time from the activation of nonpharmaceutical interventions to the first peak EDR; the first peak weekly EDR; and cumulative EDR during the entire 24-week study period.

    > Results
      There were 115 340 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths (EDR, 500/100 000 population) in the 43 cities during the 24 weeks analyzed. Every city adopted at least 1 of the 3 major categories of nonpharmaceutical interventions. School closure and public gathering bans activated concurrently represented the most common combination implemented in 34 cities (79%); this combination had a median duration of 4 weeks (range, 1-10 weeks) and was significantly associated with reductions in weekly EDR. The cities that implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r = −0.74, P < .001), lower peak mortality rates (Spearman r = 0.31, P = .02), and lower total mortality (Spearman r = 0.37, P = .008). There was a statistically significant association between increased duration of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a reduced total mortality burden (Spearman r = −0.39, P = .005).

    > Conclusions
      These findings demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States. In planning for future severe influenza pandemics, nonpharmaceutical interventions should be considered for inclusion as companion measures to developing effective vaccines and medications for prophylaxis and treatment.

    > Abstract
      Antibiotic-resistant organisms, an increasing source of morbidity and mortality, have a natural reservoir in hospitals, and recent estimates suggest that almost 2 million people develop hospital-acquired infections each year in the US alone. We investigate the temporal network of transfers of Medicare patients across US hospitals over a 2-year period to learn about the possible role of hospital-to-hospital transfers of patients in the spread of infections. We analyze temporal, geographical, and topological properties of the transfer network and show that this network may serve as a substrate for the spread of infections. Finally, we study different strategies for the early detection of incipient epidemics on the temporal transfer network as a function of activation time of a subset of sensor hospitals. We find that using approximately 2% of hospitals as sensors, chosen based on their network in-degree, with an activation time of 7 days results in optimal performance for this early warning system, enabling the early detection of 80% of the C. difficile. cases with the hospitals in the sensor set activated for only a fraction of 40% of the time.

  // Influence of a patient transfer network of US inpatient facilities on the incidence of nosocomial infections
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-02245-7
  ref 'gracia_et_al_2017
    head =  We studied a network defined by the transfer of a large number of Medicare patients across 5,667 US facilities over a 2-year period. We observed a positive correlation among mean C. difficile incidences between facilities and their network neighbors. This association was significantly stronger with a hospital’s network neighbors than with nearby non-connected hospitals across a wide range of geographic distances.

    > Abstract
      Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a substantial source of morbidity and mortality and have a common reservoir in inpatient settings. Transferring patients between facilities could be a mechanism for the spread of these infections. We wanted to assess whether a network of hospitals, linked by inpatient transfers, contributes to the spread of nosocomial infections and investigate how network structure may be leveraged to design efficient surveillance systems. We construct a network defined by the transfer of Medicare patients across US inpatient facilities using a 100% sample of inpatient discharge claims from 2006–2007. We show the association between network structure and C. difficile incidence, with a 1% increase in a facility’s C. difficile incidence being associated with a 0.53% increase in C. difficile incidence of neighboring facilities. Finally, we used network science methods to determine the facilities to monitor to maximize surveillance efficiency. An optimal surveillance strategy for selecting “sensor” hospitals, based on their network position, detects 80% of the C. difficile infections using only 2% of hospitals as sensors. Selecting a small fraction of facilities as “sensors” could be a cost-effective mechanism to monitor emerging nosocomial infections.

  // Dueling biological and social contagions
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43634
  ref 'Fu_et_al_2017
    head = The model considers how the spread of behavior coevolves with the spread of disease and that the interaction of these two contagions: biological contagion (H1N1 flu) and a social contagion (vaccination behavior or social distancing) plays a critical role in the course of their spread and the resulting implications for public health interventions or marketing. The size of epidemics is much more sensitive to the extent to which people copy one another’s vaccination behavior.

    > Abstract
      Numerous models explore how a wide variety of biological and social phenomena spread in social networks. However, these models implicitly assume that the spread of one phenomenon is not affected by the spread of another. Here, we develop a model of “dueling contagions”, with a particular illustration of a situation where one is biological (influenza) and the other is social (flu vaccination). We apply the model to unique time series data collected during the 2009 H1N1 epidemic that includes information about vaccination, flu, and face-to-face social networks. The results show that well-connected individuals are more likely to get vaccinated, as are people who are exposed to friends who get vaccinated or are exposed to friends who get the flu. Our dueling contagion model suggests that other epidemiological models may be dramatically underestimating the R0 of contagions. It also suggests that the rate of vaccination contagion may be even more important than the biological contagion in determining the course of the disease. These results suggest that real world and online platforms that make it easier to see when friends have been vaccinated (personalized vaccination campaigns) and when they get the flu (personalized flu warnings) could have a large impact on reducing the severity of epidemics. They also suggest possible benefits from understanding the coevolution of many kinds of dueling contagions.

  ref 'Christakis_et_al_2010
    head = This study proposes the method of simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals that could be used to provide early detection of contagious outbreaks and it could also be used to monitor targeted populations of any size, in real time. The method could in principle be generalized to other biological, psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

    > Abstract
      Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best. It is known that individuals near the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner during the course of an outbreak, on average, than those at the periphery. Unfortunately, mapping a whole network to identify central individuals who might be monitored for infection is typically very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely, simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students who were either members of a group of randomly chosen individuals or a group of their friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95% C.I. 9.9–16.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16 of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance. The amount of lead time will depend on features of the outbreak and the network at hand. The method could in principle be generalized to other biological, psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

    head = Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate.

    > Abstract
      The remarkable capacity of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their ability to generate de novo diversity in a short period of time. Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate. Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases. Our current knowledge of viral mutation rates indicates that viral genetic diversity is determined by multiple virus- and host-dependent processes, and that viral mutation rates can evolve in response to specific selective pressures.

    > Conclusion
      Viral mutation rates are determined by multiple processes, including polymerase intrinsic fidelity, replication mode, 3′ exonuclease activity, spontaneous nucleic acid damage, access to post-replicative repair, editing by host-encoded deaminases, imbalances in nucleotide pools, template sequence context, and template structure, as summarized in Table 2. Some of these processes underlie large-scale patterns of variation among viruses, such as differences between RNA and DNA viruses, between viruses with small and large genomes, and between single-strand and double-strand viruses, but important mechanistic aspects behind these differences still remain uncharacterized. Furthermore, mutation rates are not static and can evolve in response to selective pressures, as exemplified by fidelity variants selected under mutagenic conditions in a variety of viruses. In addition to polymerase fidelity, other mutation rate-determinants such as access to DNA repair may have also changed in response to selective pressures during viral evolution.
      In RNA viruses, both low- and high-fidelity polymerase variants tend to have a negative impact in viral fitness in complex environments, suggesting that RNA virus mutation rates have been evolutionarily optimized. Given that DNA virus mutation rates are substantially lower than those of RNA viruses this also suggests that DNA viruses show suboptimal mutation rates for adaptation to rapidly changing environments, despite RNA and DNA viruses sharing similar lifestyles. It appears that large DNA viruses have adopted a different and more elaborate strategy consisting of targeting mutations to specific genome regions subject to rapidly varying selective pressures, such as genes encoding attachment proteins or inhibitors of innate immunity responses. Mutation targeting mechanisms such as DGRs and recombination-driven gene copy amplification are probably not accessible to small DNA viruses with compact genomes. Furthermore, mutation rate evolution in small DNA viruses is further constrained by the fact they do not encode autonomous replication systems. Therefore, small DNA viruses should rely on repair avoidance and on use of host-encoded error-prone DNA polymerases to elevate their mutation rates and achieve faster adaptation. Elucidating the mutational mechanisms of small DNA viruses is a current challenge in virus molecular biology and evolution. Other exciting unresolved questions include unveiling the interplays between mutation and recombination, the roles played by viral accessory proteins in determining mutation rates, the effects of host-encoding enzymes on viral diversity and evolution, whether mutation accumulation can be evolutionary adjusted by modifying viral replication modes, and how template sequences regulate viral mutation rates.

    head = We report a model for the persistence of OC43 genotypes in human populations based on the first intensive evolutionary analysis of the S gene. We infer that the genetic drift of the S gene is likely to be one of the mechanisms of the adaptation evolution of HCoV-OC43. These findings provide insights into the evolution of CoVs and may have implications in the surveillance of HCoV infections.

    > Abstract
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) continuously threaten human health. However, to date, the evolutionary mechanisms that govern CoV strain persistence in human populations have not been fully understood. In this study, we characterized the evolution of the major antigen-spike (S) gene in the most prevalent human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. Among the five known HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to E), higher substitution rates and dN/dS values as well as more positive selection sites were detected in the S gene of genotype D, corresponding to the most dominant HCoV epidemic in recent years. Further analysis showed that the majority of substitutions were located in the S1 subunit. Among them, seven positive selection sites were chronologically traced in the temporal evolution routes of genotype D and six were located around the critical sugar binding region in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, an important sugar binding domain of CoV. These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.

      Chloroquine is a 9-aminoquinoline known since 1934. Apart from its well-known antimalarial effects, the drug has interesting biochemical properties that might be applied against some viral infections. Chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Its best-studied effects are those against HIV replication, which are being tested in clinical trials. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 6, which mediate the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. We review the available information on the effects of chloroquine on viral infections, raising the question of whether this old drug may experience a revival in the clinical management of viral diseases such as AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which afflict mankind in the era of globalisation.

    > Abstract
      Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.

      There are limited data on the use of masks and respirators to reduce transmission of influenza. A systematic review was undertaken to help inform pandemic influenza guidance in the United Kingdom. The initial review was performed in November 2009 and updated in June 2010 and January 2011. Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials and quasi‐experimental and observational studies of humans published in English with an outcome of laboratory‐confirmed or clinically‐diagnosed influenza and other viral respiratory infections. There were 17 eligible studies. Six of eight randomised controlled trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups (masks with or without hand hygiene; N95/P2 respirators). One household trial found that mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza‐like illness/laboratory‐confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction. One hospital‐based trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with non‐fit‐tested N95 respirator use compared with medical masks. Eight of nine retrospective observational studies found that mask and/or respirator use was independently associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Findings, however, may not be applicable to influenza and many studies were suboptimal. None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection. Some evidence suggests that mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection especially hand hygiene. The effectiveness of masks and respirators is likely linked to early, consistent and correct usage.

    > Abstract
      On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) a pandemic. With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%. We can conclude from our model that, if worn properly, facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.

    > Abstract
      Bats harbor many viruses asymptomatically, including several notorious for causing extreme virulence in humans. To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.

These include filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses that cause severe diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Marburg haemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The evolution of flight in bats seem to have selected for a unique set of antiviral immune responses that control virus propagation, while limiting self-damaging inflammatory responses. Here, we summarize our current understanding of antiviral immune responses in bats and discuss their ability to co-exist with emerging viruses that cause serious disease in other mammals. We highlight how this knowledge may help us to predict viral spillovers into new hosts and discuss future directions for the field.

    > Abstract
      The recent appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS–CoV) highlights the continual threat to human health posed by emerging viruses. However, the central processes in the evolution of emerging viruses are unclear, particularly the selection pressures faced by viruses in new host species. We outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence. We emphasize that, although the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide them with great adaptability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases, their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints. Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries. Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS–CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses. We show, however, that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for recombination are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineages and that recombination is unlikely to explain the appearance of SARS in humans.

    > Abstract
      To help reveal the diversity and evolution of bat coronaviruses we collected 1067 bats from 21 species in China. A total of 73 coronaviruses (32 alphacoronaviruses and 41 betacoronaviruses) were identified in these bats, with an overall prevalence of 6.84%. All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Overall, these data suggest that high contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of coronaviruses.

      In this review, we summarize the researches on animal reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Masked palm civets were suspected as the origin of the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was confirmed as the direct origin of SARS cases with mild symptom in 2004. Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human SARS-CoV with nt identity over 99.6%, indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time. Alignment of 10 complete viral genome sequences from masked palm civets with those of human SARS-CoVs revealed 26 conserved single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the viruses from masked palm civets. These conserved SNVs were gradually lost from the genomes of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 SARS epidemic. In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as the natural reservoir of a group of coronaviruses that are distantly related to SARS-CoV. The genome sequences of bat SARS-like coronavirus had about 88–92% nt identity with that of the SARS-CoV. The prevalence of antibodies and viral RNA in different bat species and the characteristics of the bat SARS-like coronavirus were elucidated. Apart from masked palm civets and bats, 29 other animal species had been tested for the SARS-CoV, and the results are summarized in this paper.

    > Abstract
      The four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children. While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century. New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.

    > Abstract
      Coronaviruses are found in a diverse array of bat and bird species, which are believed to act as natural hosts. Molecular clock dating analyses of coronaviruses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of these viruses existed around 10,000 years ago. This relatively young age is in sharp contrast to the ancient evolutionary history of their putative natural hosts, which began diversifying tens of millions of years ago. Here, we attempted to resolve this discrepancy by applying more realistic evolutionary models that have previously revealed the ancient evolutionary history of other RNA viruses. By explicitly modeling variation in the strength of natural selection over time and thereby improving the modeling of substitution saturation, we found that the time to the most recent ancestor common for all coronaviruses is likely far greater (millions of years) than the previously inferred range.
