| Functional group | Structural formula | Importance |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Hydroxyl | —O—H | Hydroxyl groups are polar. They are components of all four types of organic compounds discussed in this chapter. They are involved in dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis reactions. |
| Carboxyl | O—C—OH | Carboxyl groups are found within fatty acids, amino acids, and many other acids. |
| Amino | —N—H<sub>2</sub> | Amino groups are found within amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. |
| Methyl | —C—H<sub>3</sub> | Methyl groups are found within amino acids. |
| Phosphate | —P—O<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup> | Phosphate groups are found within phospholipids and nucleotides. |
