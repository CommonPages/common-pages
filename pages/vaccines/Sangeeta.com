  // Immune enhancing properties of the novel Matrix-M™ adjuvant leads to potentiated immune responses to an influenza vaccine in mice
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.01.039
  ref 'Magnusson_et_al_03_23_2013
    head = The present study is a pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and mode-of-action of Matrix-M™ formulated influenza vaccine in mice. We compared the mode of action of Matrix-M™ with Alum, FCA and AS03 alone or formulated with influenza split virion antigen injected intramuscularly.

    > Abstract
      The novel saponin based adjuvant Matrix-M™ was recently used in a Phase I study of seasonal influenza in elderly. The present study is a pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and mode-of-action of Matrix-M™ formulated influenza vaccine in mice. A manuscript on safety profile and immunogenicity in elderly humans is under preparation.

      We have previously shown that subcutaneous injections of Matrix-M™, without coformulated antigen, results in a dose-dependent recruitment of leukocytes to draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Herein we compared the mode of action of Matrix-M™ with Alum, FCA and AS03 alone or formulated with influenza split virion antigen injected intramuscularly. The elicited responses in dLNs and spleen were investigated 48 h later. Matrix-M™ was particularly efficient in activation of central innate immune cells such as neutrophils, DCs and macrophages compared to the other adjuvants analyzed. Moreover, the adjuvant influence on the recall immune response to influenza antigen was studied by in vitro re-stimulation of splenocytes from mice immunized with influenza antigen adjuvanted with Matrix-M™, Alum or AS03. Splenocytes from mice immunized with influenza antigen and Matrix-M™ produced both Th1 and Th2 cytokines upon re-stimulation. This response was significantly stronger than that induced by the other adjuvants studied. Interestingly, increased levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant KC were produced by antigen stimulated splenocytes from mice immunized with Matrix-M™ adjuvanted vaccine, which is in agreement with the increase of neutrophils into dLNs and spleen after Matrix-M™ injection. Furthermore, influenza antigen adjuvanted with Matrix-M™ induced significantly higher antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2a responses compared to antigen alone. In conclusion, adjuvant Matrix-M™ activates the innate immune system without antigen present. This activation may explain the enhanced immunity to influenza seen with Matrix-M™ adjuvant. Despite this potent immune activation mediated by Matrix-M™, GLP-toxicity studies and clinical data suggest that Matrix-M™ adjuvant has a mild to moderate safety profile.

    > Abstract
      Ideally, a candidate pandemic influenza vaccine should elicit rapid and strong cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, which are long-lasting and exhibit broad cross-reactivity against drifted strains. The present study investigated the detailed humoral and cellular immune responses in mice vaccinated intranasally or intramuscularly with inactivated influenza H5N1 (NIBRG-14) virosomal vaccine alone or formulated with Matrix-M adjuvant. The intramuscular Matrix-M-adjuvanted vaccine induced a strong immediate and long-term humoral immune response with high cross-reactivity against drifted H5N1 viruses and showed a dose-sparing potential. Additionally, the vaccine induced a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine profile and most importantly high frequencies of multifunctional Th1 CD4+ cells. Our results highlight that Matrix-M adjuvant is a promising parenteral adjuvant for formulating pandemic candidate vaccines.

  // Matrix-M Adjuvated Seasonal Virosomal Influenza Vaccine Induces Partial Protection in Mice and Ferrets against Avian H5 and H7 Challenge
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135723
  ref 'Cox_et_al_09_24_2015
    head = We evaluate whether a seasonal trivalent virosomal vaccine (TVV) adjuvated with the saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M (MM) can confer protection against avian influenza H5 and H7 virus strains in mice and ferrets.

    > Abstract
      There is a constant threat of zoonotic influenza viruses causing a pandemic outbreak in humans. It is virtually impossible to predict which virus strain will cause the next pandemic and it takes a considerable amount of time before a safe and effective vaccine will be available once a pandemic occurs. In addition, development of pandemic vaccines is hampered by the generally poor immunogenicity of avian influenza viruses in humans. An effective pre-pandemic vaccine is therefore required as a first line of defense. Broadening of the protective efficacy of current seasonal vaccines by adding an adjuvant may be a way to provide such first line of defense. Here we evaluate whether a seasonal trivalent virosomal vaccine (TVV) adjuvated with the saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M (MM) can confer protection against avian influenza H5 and H7 virus strains in mice and ferrets. We demonstrate that mice were protected from death against challenges with H5N1 and H7N7, but that the protection was not complete as evidenced by severe clinical signs. In ferrets, protection against H7N9 was not observed. In contrast, reduced upper and lower respiratory tract viral loads and reduced lung pathology, was achieved in H5N1 challenged ferrets. Together these results suggest that, at least to some extent, Matrix-M adjuvated seasonal virosomal influenza vaccine can serve as an interim measure to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with a pandemic outbreak.

  //  Matrix-M adjuvant enhances antibody, cellular and protective immune responses of a Zaire Ebola/Makona virus glycoprotein (GP) nanoparticle vaccine
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.033
  ref 'Bengtsson_et_al_02_24_2016
    head = We explored the use of the saponin adjuvant, Matrix-M, for the development of a protective, protein-based vaccine against EBOV disease. In this report a full length, unmodified Zaire EBOV GP gene from the 2014 EBOV Makona strain (EBOV/Mak) was cloned into a baculovirus vector. A recombinant EBOV/Mak full length GP nanoparticle vaccine formulated with Matrix-M, AlPO4 or saline was evaluated.

    > Abstract
      Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever for which there is no approved treatment or preventive vaccine. Immunological correlates of protective immunity against EBOV disease are not well understood. However, non-human primate studies have associated protection of experimental vaccines with binding and neutralizing antibodies to the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) as well as EBOV GP-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In this report a full length, unmodified Zaire EBOV GP gene from the 2014 EBOV Makona strain (EBOV/Mak) was cloned into a baculovirus vector. Recombinant EBOV/Mak GP was produced in Sf9 insect cells as glycosylated trimers and, when purified, formed spherical 30-40 nm particles. In mice, EBOV/Mak GP co-administered with the saponin adjuvant Matrix-M was significantly more immunogenic, as measured by virus neutralization titers and anti-EBOV/Mak GP IgG as compared to immunization with AlPO4 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted EBOV/Mak GP. Similarly, antigen specific T cells secreting IFN-γ were induced most prominently by EBOV/Mak GP with Matrix-M. Matrix-M also enhanced the frequency of antigen-specific germinal center B cells and follicular helper T (TFH) cells in the spleen in a dose-dependent manner. Immunization with EBOV/Mak GP with Matrix-M was 100% protective in a lethal viral challenge murine model; whereas no protection was observed with the AlPO4 adjuvant and only 10% (1/10) mice were protected in the EBOV/Mak GP antigen alone group. Matrix-M adjuvanted vaccine induced a rapid onset of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies, increased frequency of multifunctional CD4+ and CD8(+) T cells, specific TFH cells, germinal center B cells, and persistence of EBOV GP-specific plasma B cells in the bone marrow. Taken together, the addition of Matrix-M adjuvant to the EBOV/Mak GP nanoparticles enhanced both B and T-cell immune stimulation which may be critical for an Ebola subunit vaccine with broad and long lasting protective immunity.

    > Abstract
      T cellular responses play a significant role in mediating protective immune responses against influenza in humans. In the current study, we evaluated the ability of a candidate virosomal H5N1 vaccine adjuvanted with Matrix MTM to induce CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in a phase 1 clinical trial. We vaccinated 60 healthy adult volunteers (at days 0 and 21) with 30 μg haemagglutinin (HA) alone or 1.5, 7.5, or 30 μg HA formulated with Matrix MTM. To evaluate the T cellular responses, lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with homologous (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 [H5N1]) and heterologous H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/05 or A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1A/05) antigens. The antigen-specific cytokine responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining and by multiplex (Luminex) assays. An increase in CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cytokines was detected 21 days after the first vaccine dose. No increase in Th cytokine responses was observed after the second dose, although it is possible that the cytokine levels peaked earlier than sampling point at day 42. Formulation with the Matrix MTM adjuvant augmented both the homologous and cross-reactive cytokine response. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses were detected only in a few vaccinated individuals. The concentrations of Th1 and to a lesser extent, Th2 cytokines at 21 days post-vaccination correlated moderately with subsequent days 35 and 180 serological responses as measured by the microneutralisation, haemagglutination inhibition, and single radial hemolysis assays. Results presented here show that the virosomal H5N1 vaccine induced balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine responses and that Matrix MTM is a promising adjuvant for future development of candidate pandemic influenza vaccines.

  // Matrix-M™ adjuvant enhances immunogenicity of both protein- and modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based influenza vaccines in mice

  ref 'Magnusson_et_al_03_28_2018
    head = BALB/c mice were vaccinated with either protein- or rMVA-based HA influenza vaccines, formulated with or without the saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant.

    > Abstract
      Influenza viruses continuously circulate in the human population and escape recognition by virus neutralizing antibodies induced by prior infection or vaccination through accumulation of mutations in the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Various strategies to develop a vaccine that provides broad protection against different influenza A viruses are under investigation, including use of recombinant (r) viral vectors and adjuvants. The replication-deficient modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a promising vaccine vector that efficiently induces B and T cell responses specific for the antigen of interest. It is assumed that live vaccine vectors do not require an adjuvant to be immunogenic as the vector already mediates recruitment and activation of immune cells. To address this topic, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with either protein- or rMVA-based HA influenza vaccines, formulated with or without the saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant. Co-formulation with Matrix-M significantly increased HA vaccine immunogenicity, resulting in antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses comparable to those induced by unadjuvanted rMVA-HA. Of special interest, rMVA-HA immunogenicity was also enhanced by addition of Matrix-M, demonstrated by enhanced HA inhibition antibody titres and cellular immune responses. Matrix-M added to either protein- or rMVA-based HA vaccines mediated recruitment and activation of antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes to the draining lymph node 24 and 48 h post-vaccination. Taken together, these results suggest that adjuvants can be used not only with protein-based vaccines but also in combination with rMVA to increase vaccine immunogenicity, which may be a step forward to generate new and more effective influenza vaccines.

  // Matrix‐M adjuvanted virosomal H5N1 vaccine confers protection against lethal viral challenge in a murine model

  ref 'Pedersen_et_al_05_09_2011
    head = This study investigated in a murine model the protective efficacy of Matrix‐M adjuvanted virosomal influenza H5N1 vaccine against highly pathogenic lethal viral challenge. Mice were vaccinated intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly (IM) with 7·5 μg and 30 μg HA of inactivated A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) (NIBRG‐14) virosomal adjuvanted vaccine formulated with or without 10 μg of Matrix‐M adjuvant and challenged IN with the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus.

    > Background
      A candidate pandemic influenza H5N1 vaccine should provide rapid and long‐lasting immunity against antigenically drifted viruses. As H5N1 viruses are poorly immunogenic, this may require a combination of immune potentiating strategies. An attractive approach is combining the intrinsic immunogenicity of virosomes with another promising adjuvant to further boost the immune response. As regulatory authorities have not yet approved a surrogate correlate of protection for H5N1 vaccines, it is important to test the protective efficacy of candidate H5N1 vaccines in a viral challenge study.

    > Objectives
      This study investigated in a murine model the protective efficacy of Matrix‐M adjuvanted virosomal influenza H5N1 vaccine against highly pathogenic lethal viral challenge.

    > Methods
      Mice were vaccinated intranasally  or intramuscularly (IM) with 7·5 μg and 30 μg HA of inactivated A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) (NIBRG‐14) virosomal adjuvanted vaccine formulated with or without 10 μg of Matrix‐M adjuvant and challenged IN with the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus.

    > Results and conclusions
      IM vaccination provided protection irrespective of dose and the presence of Matrix‐M adjuvant, whilst the IN vaccine required adjuvant to protect against the challenge. The Matrix‐M adjuvanted vaccine induced a strong and cross‐reactive serum antibody response indicative of seroprotection after both IM and IN administration. In addition, the IM vaccine induced the highest frequencies of influenza specific CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells. The results confirm a high potential of Matrix‐M adjuvanted virosomal vaccines and support the progress of this vaccine into a phase 1 clinical trial.

    > Abstract
      Saponin-based adjuvants are widely used to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses towards vaccine antigens, although it is not yet completely known how they mediate their stimulatory effects. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of adjuvant Matrix-M™ without antigen and Alum was used as reference adjuvant. Adjuvant Matrix-M™ is comprised of 40 nm nanoparticles composed of Quillaja saponins, cholesterol and phospholipid. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected once with, 3, 12 or 30 µg of Matrix-M™, resulting in recruitment of leukocytes to draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and spleen 48 h post treatment. Flow cytometry analysis identified CD11b+ Gr-1high granulocytes as the cell population increasing most in dLNs and spleen. Additionally, dendritic cells, F4/80int cells, T-, B- and NK-cells were recruited to dLNs and in spleen the number of F4/80int cells, and to some extent, B cells and dendritic cells, increased. Elevated levels of early activation marker CD69 were detected on T-, B- and NK-cells, CD11b+ Gr-1high cells, F4/80int cells and dendritic cells in dLNs. In spleen CD69 was mainly up-regulated on NK cells. B cells and dendritic cells in dLNs and spleen showed an increased expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 and dendritic cells in dLNs expressed elevated levels of MHC class II. The high-dose (30 µg) of Matrix-M™ induced detectable serum levels of IL-6 and MIP-1β 4 h post administration, most likely representing spillover of locally produced cytokines. A lesser increase of IL-6 in serum after administration of 12 µg Matrix-M™ was also observed. In conclusion, early immunostimulatory properties were demonstrated by Matrix-M™ alone, as therapeutic doses resulted in a local transient immune response with recruitment and activation of central immune cells to dLNs. These effects may play a role in enhancing uptake and presentation of vaccine antigens to elicit a competent immune response.

    > Abstract
      The avian influenza H5 virus epizootic continues to cause zoonosis with human fatalities, highlighting the continued need for pandemic preparedness against this subtype. This study evaluated the tolerability and immunogenicity of a Matrix M™ adjuvanted virosomal H5N1 vaccine in a phase I clinical trial. Sixty healthy adults were vaccinated intramuscularly with two doses of influenza H5N1 (NIBRG-14) virosomal vaccine alone (30 μg haemagglutinin (HA)) or 1.5, 7.5 or 30 μg HA formulated with 50 μg Matrix M™ adjuvant. The antibody response was analysed by haemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralisation (MN) and single radial haemolysis (SRH) assays. The vaccine was well tolerated in all groups but injection site pain was more frequently observed in the Matrix M™ adjuvanted groups. The vaccine elicited homologous and heterologous H5N1-specific antibody responses and the Matrix M™ adjuvanted formulations met all the EU regulatory criteria. In conclusion, Matrix M™ adjuvant was well tolerated and augmented the antibody response allowing considerable dose sparing down to 1.5 μg HA.

  // Innate immune responses induced by the saponin adjuvant Matrix-M in specific pathogen free pigs
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-017-0437-2
  ref 'Ahlberg_et_al_05_22_2017
    head = Immunomodulatory effects of Matrix-M were evaluated at contact exposure of specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs  to conventionally reared pigs.

    > Abstract
      Saponin-based adjuvants have been widely used to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses in many species, but their mode of action is not fully understood. A characterization of the porcine transcriptional response to Matrix-M was performed in vitro using lymphocytes, monocytes or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and in vivo. The effect of Matrix-M was also evaluated in specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs exposed to conventionally reared pigs. The pro-inflammatory cytokine genes IL1B and CXCL8 were up-regulated in monocytes and lymphocytes after Matrix-M exposure. Matrix-M also induced IL12B, IL17A and IFNG in lymphocytes and IFN-α gene expression in MoDCs. Several genes were indicated as up-regulated by Matrix-M in blood 18 h after injection, of which the genes for IFN-α and TLR2 could be statistically confirmed. Respiratory disease developed in all SPF pigs mixed with conventional pigs within 1–3 days. Two out of four SPF pigs injected with saline prior to contact exposure displayed systemic symptoms that was not recorded for the four pigs administered Matrix-M. Granulocyte counts, serum amyloid A levels and transcription of IL18 and TLR2 coincided with disease progression in the pigs. These results support further evaluation of Matrix-M as a possible enhancer of innate immune responses during critical moments in pig management.

  // Matrix-M™ adjuvation broadens protection induced by seasonal trivalent virosomal influenza vaccine
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0435-9
  ref 'Cox_et_al_12_08_2015
    head = To assess the immune potentiating properties of Matrix-M™, mice were immunized with virosomal trivalent seasonal vaccine adjuvated with Matrix-M™.

    > Background
      Influenza virus infections are responsible for significant morbidity worldwide and therefore it remains a high priority to develop more broadly protective vaccines. Adjuvation of current seasonal influenza vaccines has the potential to achieve this goal.

    > Methods
      To assess the immune potentiating properties of Matrix-M™, mice were immunized with virosomal trivalent seasonal vaccine adjuvated with Matrix-M™. Serum samples were isolated to determine the hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibody titers against vaccine homologous and heterologous strains. Furthermore, we assess whether adjuvation with Matrix-M™ broadens the protective efficacy of the virosomal trivalent seasonal vaccine against vaccine homologous and heterologous influenza viruses.

    > Results
      Matrix-M™ adjuvation enhanced HAI antibody titers and protection against vaccine homologous strains. Interestingly, Matrix-M™ adjuvation also resulted in HAI antibody titers against heterologous influenza B strains, but not against the tested influenza A strains. Even though the protection against heterologous influenza A was induced by the adjuvated vaccine, in the absence of HAI titers the protection was accompanied by severe clinical scores and body weight loss. In contrast, in the presence of heterologous HAI titers full protection against the heterologous influenza B strain without any disease symptoms was obtained.

    > Conclusion
      The results of this study emphasize the promising potential of a Matrix-M™-adjuvated seasonal trivalent virosomal influenza vaccine. Adjuvation of trivalent virosomal vaccine does not only enhance homologous protection, but in addition induces protection against heterologous strains and thus provides overall more potent and broad protective immunity.

  // ISCOM technology-based Matrix M™ adjuvant: success in future vaccines relies on formulation
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1586/erv.11.25
  ref 'Bengtsson_et_al_01_09_2014
    head = We show that the novel and widely tested saponin based Matrix M™ (Isconova AB, Uppsala, Sweden) adjuvant formulation is ready for application in humans.

    > Summary
      Adjuvant development is driven by the need to improve immune responses to vaccine antigens without increasing side effects beyond an acceptable level. Adjuvant use in human vaccines has been both limited and cautious and, until the last decade, only aluminum salt adjuvants were approved. In animal vaccines, however, several adjuvants and antigen-presentation systems have been used, including plain saponins, immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs), matrix, montanide oils, carbopol formulations, poxvirus constructs and DNA-based formulations. Here, we show that the novel and widely tested saponin based Matrix M™ (Isconova AB, Uppsala, Sweden) adjuvant formulation is ready for application in humans.

    quote !a = The adjuvant activities of matrix formulations parallel those of ISCOMs, inducing high and long-lasting levels of broadly reacting antibodies supported by a balanced Th1/Th2 response including multifunctional T cells and CTLs. The adjuvant properties of matrix fulfil the demands of a modern adjuvant: a formulation with dose-sparing capacity, improved quality of immune responses and an acceptable safety profile.

    quote !c = Matrix formulations perform well with most types of antigen, with the exception of low-molecular-weight hydrophilic antigens. Such antigens probably require some ‘physical’ help in terms of size and/or multimericity.

    quote !d = The formulation of vaccines with matrix adjuvant is convenient as the vaccine antigen(s) is simply mixed with a suspension of matrix particles in physiological buffers not requiring adsorption or emulsification.

    / January, 2014 - Expert Review of Vaccines
    quote !e = The novel formulation, Matrix M, consists of two individually formed matrix particles, each with a different and well-characterized saponin fraction with complementary properties. The mixture of individually formulated particles significantly improves both adjuvant activity and safety profile. One type of particle consists of highly adjuvant active saponin molecules (Fraction-C saponin), the other of a weaker but very well-tolerated saponin (Fraction A). By mixing the two matrix particles, the dose of the highly active but slightly reactogenic Matrix C™ component may be lowered by a factor of 5–10 while keeping the high-dose adjuvant activity. Hence the safety margin is substantially increased, which is essential for certain sensitive animal species.

  // Safety and immunogenicity of a candidate Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus viral-vectored vaccine: a dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30160-2
  ref 'Folegatti_et_al_04_20_2020
    head = This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 × 109 viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5 × 1010 viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 × 1010 viral particles.

    > Background
      Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans.

    > Methods
      This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 × 109 viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5 × 1010 viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 × 1010 viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399578.

    > Findings
      Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5 × 1010 viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66–81]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18–33]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5·83 [95% CI 2·11–17·42], p<0·0001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p<0·003) and IgG (p<0·0001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19–73]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58–93]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay.

    > Interpretation
      ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.

    > Abstract
      Recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vaccine vectors for HIV-1 and other pathogens have been shown to be limited by high titers of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in the developing world. Alternative serotype rAd vectors have therefore been constructed. Here we report Ad5, Ad26, Ad35, and Ad48 NAb titers in 4,381 individuals from North America, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. As expected, Ad5 NAb titers were both frequent and high magnitude in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In contrast, Ad35 NAb titers proved infrequent and low in all regions studied, and Ad48 NAbs were rare in all regions except East Africa. Ad26 NAbs were moderately common in adults in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, but Ad26 NAb titers proved markedly lower than Ad5 NAb titers in all regions, and these relatively low Ad26 NAb titers did not detectably suppress the immunogenicity of 4×1010 vp of a rAd26-Gag/Pol/Env/Nef vaccine in rhesus monkeys. These data inform the clinical development of alternative serotype rAd vaccine vectors in the developing world.

    > Background
      A recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based vaccine expressing the glycoprotein of Ebola Zaire Makona variant showed good safety and immunogenicity in a phase 1 trial of healthy Chinese adults. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in healthy adults in Sierra Leone and to determine the optimal dose.

    > Methods
      We did a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial at Sierra Leone–China Friendship Hospital, Freetown, Sierra Leone. We recruited healthy adults aged 18–50 years who were HIV negative, had no history of Ebola virus infection, and had no previous immunisation with other Ebola vaccine candidates. Participants were sequentially enrolled and randomly assigned (2:1:1), by computer-generated block randomisation (block size of eight), to receive the high-dose vaccine (1·6 × 1011 viral particles), low-dose vaccine (8·0 × 1010 viral particles), or placebo (containing only vaccine excipients, with no viral particles). Participants, investigators, and study staff (except two study pharmacists) were masked from treatment allocation. The primary safety outcome was occurrence of solicited adverse reactions within 7 days of vaccination, analysed by intention to treat. The primary immunogenicity outcome was glycoprotein-specific antibody responses at days 14, 28, and 168 after vaccination, analysed in all vaccinated participants who had blood samples drawn for antibody tests. The trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201509001259869, and is completed.

    > Findings
      During Oct 10–28, 2015, 500 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive the high-dose vaccine (n=250), low-dose vaccine (n=125), or placebo (n=125). 132 (53%) participants in the high-dose group, 60 (48%) in the low-dose group, and 54 (43%) in the placebo group reported at least one solicited adverse reaction within 7 days of vaccination. Most adverse reactions were mild and self-limiting. Solicited injection-site adverse reactions were significantly more frequent in vaccine recipients (65 [26%] in high-dose group and 31 [25%] in low-dose group) than in those receiving placebo (17 [14%]; p=0·0169). Glycoprotein-specific antibody responses were detected from day 14 onwards (geometric mean titre 1251·0 [95% CI 976·6–1602·5] in low-dose group and 1728·4 [1459·4–2047·0] in high-dose group) and peaked at day 28 (1471·8 [1151·0–1881·8] and 2043·1 [1762·4–2368·4]), but declined quickly in the following months (223·3 [148·2–336·4] and 254·2 [185·0–349·5] at day 168). Geometric mean titres in the placebo group remained around 6·0–6·8 throughout the study period. Three serious adverse events (malaria, gastroenteritis, and one fatal asthma episode) were reported in the high-dose vaccine group, but none was deemed related to the vaccine.

    > Interpretation
      The recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine was safe and highly immunogenic in healthy Sierra Leonean adults, and 8·0 × 1010 viral particles was the optimal dose.

At that time, approximately two thirds of the total predicted person-years of follow-up between enrollment and the 24-month study visit had been completed.

    > Background
      A safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a global priority. We tested the efficacy of a DNA prime–recombinant adenovirus type 5 boost (DNA/rAd5) vaccine regimen in persons at increased risk for HIV-1 infection in the United States.

    > Methods
      At 21 sites, we randomly assigned 2504 men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive the DNA/rAd5 vaccine (1253 participants) or placebo (1251 participants). We assessed HIV-1 acquisition from week 28 through month 24 (termed week 28+ infection), viral-load set point (mean plasma HIV-1 RNA level 10 to 20 weeks after diagnosis), and safety. The 6-plasmid DNA vaccine (expressing clade B Gag, Pol, and Nef and Env proteins from clades A, B, and C) was administered at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The rAd5 vector boost (expressing clade B Gag-Pol fusion protein and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C) was administered at week 24.

    > Results
      In April 2013, the data and safety monitoring board recommended halting vaccinations for lack of efficacy. The primary analysis showed that week 28+ infection had been diagnosed in 27 participants in the vaccine group and 21 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, −25.0%; 95% confidence interval, −121.2 to 29.3; P=0.44), with mean viral-load set points of 4.46 and 4.47 HIV-1 RNA log10 copies per milliliter, respectively. Analysis of all infections during the study period (41 in the vaccine group and 31 in the placebo group) also showed lack of vaccine efficacy (P=0.28). The vaccine regimen had an acceptable side-effect profile.

    > Conclusions
      The DNA/rAd5 vaccine regimen did not reduce either the rate of HIV-1 acquisition or the viral-load set point in the population studied. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00865566. opens in new tab.)

    head = Two phase IIb test-of-concept studies evaluated the replication-defective adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vaccine MRK gag/pol/nef HIV vaccine to prevent infection or decrease early plasma viral load in disparate populations. The STEP study enrolled men and women in the Americas, Caribbean and Australia; the Phambili trial enrolled men and women in South Africa, where the modes of sexual transmission and HIV-1 risk, subtypes of HIV-1, and background Ad5 seroprevalence differed.

    > Purpose of review
      Two phase IIb test-of-concept studies evaluated the replication-defective adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vaccine MRK gag/pol/nef HIV vaccine to prevent infection or decrease early plasma viral load in disparate populations. The STEP study enrolled men and women in the Americas, Caribbean and Australia; the Phambili trial enrolled men and women in South Africa, where the modes of sexual transmission and HIV-1 risk, subtypes of HIV-1, and background Ad5 seroprevalence differed.

    > Recent findings
      Vaccination in both studies were stopped, after the first interim efficacy analysis of the STEP study crossed predetermined nonefficacy boundaries. Neither trial demonstrated a decrease in HIV acquisition nor decreased early plasma viral load in vaccinees compared with placebo recipients. Post-hoc analyses of men enrolled in the STEP study showed a larger number of HIV infections in the subgroup of vaccinated men who were Ad5-seropositive and uncircumcised compared with a comparable placebo group. This was not demonstrated in the Phambili study, in which most men were heterosexual, whereas most in STEP were homosexual/bisexual. Further analysis of the STEP study has yet to explain the effect of Ad5 seroprevalence on increased HIV-1 susceptibility in men receiving the vaccine. However, promising vaccine effects on early viral control were seen, and the possibility of effects on early viral load set-point in women in Phambili was seen.

    > Summary
      These trials have provided a number of lessons about the importance of clinical trials in the HIV vaccine discovery process, and insight into the type and level of immune response that will be required for control of viral replication.

  ref 'Badgujar_et_al_07_21_2020
    head = This review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine.

    > Background and aim
      The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine.

    > Method
      A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review.

    > Results
      The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine.

    > Conclusion
      In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art.

Several reports were showing the production of humoral and cellular immune response against SARS-CoV live attenuated vaccine [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. However, these vaccines possess the safety issues such as live-attenuated strain virus may return back to its original pathogenic form or development of more potent and mutant virulent strain [[30], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. Further, some reports showed inflammation to liver and lung, neutrophil influx, and pro-inflammatory cytokine after getting challenge in animal model [33,34]. Besides this, it has drawbacks such as unsuitability of vaccination to immunologically sensitive population, requirement of multiple, frequent or high dosages of vaccination, reversing to virulence and appearance of low response in immune-compressed hosts which having comorbidities.

    # quote !a = In conclusion, the inactivated vaccine is considered as safe compared to live-attenuated form due to absence of living pathogens and their inability of possible re-infection [22]. The chances of reverting back into virulent phases are much less in case of inactivated vaccines than live attenuated vaccine [[37], [38], [39]]. However, mode of presentation of unexpected immune response (than that of actual pathogenecity) is the major limitation of inactivated vaccine [22,44]. In case of inactivated coronaviruses vaccine, some reports showed inflammation and lung lesion with eosinophil infiltration [39,49]; whereas, few articles reported that, inactivated vaccines lead to create weaker immune response or delayed immune response [42] with requirement of multiple dosages [48], since actual infection is not established. Thus, multiple/high/frequent dosage, weaker and unexpected immune response is the major limitation associated with use of inactivated vaccines.

These vaccines do not contain the viral genetic materials, while they include only essential antigenic protein component to stimulate the immunogenic response [[50], [51], [52]]. Various reports mentioned induction of neutralizing antibodies [50], IgA, IgG [54,56,57], Th-1 and Th-2 [51] type of immunogenic response by subunit coronavirus vaccine. The major advantage of these vaccines are the lesser chance of adverse impact, since actual naturally occurring viral components are not available in it and hence considered as more safer than first generation vaccines [23]. Besides this, subunit vaccine designing can offer an opportunity to vaccinate against multiple epitopes (of genes subunit) from the similar or different kinds of pathogens/strains [59]. However, some reports concluded poor or delayed immunogenic response (due to absence of several other viral components) which may be sometimes overcome by use of appropriate adjuvant [51,54,58]. Due to definite immunogenic components of protein subunits, production can be readily possible in outbreak situation and can be enhanced by use of adjuvant which is the major outstanding features of subunit vaccines [54].

    # quote !a = S gene/spike proteins are specifically reported to code in adenovirus vector which induces the immune response [[60], [61], [62]]. The viral vector base vaccine is more advantageous than first generation vaccine since it vaccinate the live virus by recombination of antigenic protein component of pathogenic virus into non-virulent vector [24,61]. Thus it mimics the possible natural pathogenic infection with subsequent cellular and humoral immunogenicity [[60], [61], [62]]. The major challenge in designing of this kind of vaccine is to know the exact epidemiology, genotoxicity and virology of both viruses (pathogenic and vector virus) [24,62]. Hence it is difficult to design rapid vector base vaccine for the newly emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Further, major limitation is the hampering and delaying of actual expected immune response against pathogenic virus, since, primary and pre-existing immune response is mainly acquired due to vector virus which is known as the pre-existing immune response [24]. Besides this, there is a risk of mutation and unexpected virulence ability of engineered vectored virus.

  // Comparative evaluation of two severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine candidates in mice challenged with SARS coronavirus
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.81579-0
  ref 'See_et_al_03_06_2006
    head = A whole killed (inactivated by β-propiolactone) SARS-CoV vaccine and a combination of two adenovirus-based vectors, one expressing the nucleocapsid (N) and the other expressing the spike (S) protein (collectively designated Ad S/N), were evaluated for the induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses and their ability to protect against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication (to reduce viral load in the murine respiratory tract)./ for their ability to induce immunogenicity and to reduce viral load in the murine respiratory tract.

    > Abstract
      Two different severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine strategies were evaluated for their ability to protect against live SARS coronavirus (CoV) challenge in a murine model of infection. A whole killed (inactivated by β-propiolactone) SARS-CoV vaccine and a combination of two adenovirus-based vectors, one expressing the nucleocapsid (N) and the other expressing the spike (S) protein (collectively designated Ad S/N), were evaluated for the induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses and their ability to protect against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication. The whole killed virus (WKV) vaccine given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice was more effective than the Ad S/N vaccine administered either intranasally or intramuscularly in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in the murine respiratory tract. This protective ability of the WKV vaccine correlated with the induction of high serum neutralizing-antibody titres, but not with cellular immune responses as measured by gamma interferon secretion by mouse splenocytes. Titres of serum neutralizing antibodies induced by the Ad S/N vaccine administered intranasally or intramuscularly were significantly lower than those induced by the WKV vaccine. However, Ad S/N administered intranasally, but not intramuscularly, significantly limited SARS-CoV replication in the lungs. Among the vaccine groups, SARS-CoV-specific IgA was found only in the sera of mice immunized intranasally with Ad S/N, suggesting that mucosal immunity may play a role in protection for the intranasal Ad S/N delivery system. Finally, the sera of vaccinated mice contained antibodies to S, further suggesting a role for this protein in conferring protective immunity against SARS-CoV infection.

Moreover, the IFN-γ-secreting response observed in splenocytes of Ad S/N IN-vaccinated mice was more than twofold lower than that found in mice immunized with Ad S/N IM, indicating that cellular immune responses do not contribute to protection against SARS-CoV challenge as strongly as an antibody response.

    quote !m = In our study, total serum SARS-CoV-specific IgG and neutralizing-antibody levels were not enhanced by the addition of alum to the WKV vaccine preparation and protection from virus replication was not improved discernibly. In contrast, the immunoreactivity of pooled mouse sera towards both the full-length N protein and the S protein fragment was enhanced when the WKV vaccine formulation contained alum.

    / March, 2006 - Journal of General Virology
    quote !n = These results suggest that the inclusion of alum in the WKV vaccine may lead to enhanced production of antibody to denatured protein. Interestingly, the S protein domain (aa 318–510) recognized by the sera of WKV-vaccinated mice in our studies is known to bind to the SARS-CoV functional receptor, ACE2. Antibodies present against this S domain may explain why sera from our WKV-vaccinated mice were able to block SARS-CoV-mediated CPE in Vero E6 cells.

      The immunogenicity of a candidate-inactivated vaccine prepared from SARS-CoV F69 strain was evaluated in Balb/c mice. Potent humoral immune responses were induced under the elicitation of three times of immunizations at 2-week intervals with this vaccine, combined with three types of adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant, Al(OH)3 adjuvant and CpG adjuvant). Titers of specific IgG antibodies in three test groups all peaked in the sixth week after first vaccination, but significant differences existed in the kinetics of specific IgG antibody levels. The strong neutralizing capacity exhibited in micro-cytopathic effect neutralization tests indicated the specific antibodies are protective.

    > Abstract
      SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) strain GZ50 was partially purified and inactivated with 1:2000 formaldehyde. In cell culture the inactivated virus blocked the replication of live virus by decreasing the TCID 5.0 of the live virus 103.6 to 104.6 times. Inactivated GZ50 was used to immunize mice intranasally either alone, or after precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), or with CpG, or CTB as an adjuvant. The titer of serum neutralizing antibodies was up to 1:640. In mice immunized with adjuvants or PEG precipitated GZ50, specific IgA was detected in tracheal-lung wash fluid by immunofluorescence. Though serum antibodies were detected, no anti-SARS-IgA could be detected in mice immunized only with inactivated GZ50. The roles of adjuvants in intranasal immunization with inactivated.

      We tested the ability of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine to induce neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice. The inactivated vaccine was prepared by SARS-CoV virus propagation in Vero cells, with subsequent β-propiolactone inactivation and Sepharose 4FF column chromatography purification. One hundred forty BALB/c female mice were divided into seven groups of 20 mice each. Of the seven groups, three groups were inoculated with 0.1, 1, and 3 μg of the vaccine without adjuvant while three other groups were inoculated at the same three dosages of vaccine with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, respectively. The remaining group was set up as a blank control. Each mouse was inoculated twice at an interval of 3 weeks. One week after the second immunization, mice sera were collected to detect serum neutralizing antibodies. An assay for determining neutralizing antibody titers was developed. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) higher dosages of vaccine induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody titer; (2) the level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the inoculation with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was slightly higher than that without adjuvant, but the difference was not statistically significant.

    > Abstract
      The only severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine currently being tested in clinical trial consists of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associate coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, limited information is available about host immune responses induced by the inactivated SARS vaccine. In this study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV inactivated by β-propiolactone elicited high titers of antibodies in the immunized mice and rabbits that recognize the spike (S) protein, especially the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region. The antisera from the immunized animals efficiently bound to the RBD and blocked binding of RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor on the susceptible cells for SARS-CoV. With a sensitive and quantitative single-cycle infection assay using pseudovirus bearing the SARS-CoV S protein, we demonstrated that mouse and rabbit antisera significantly inhibited S protein-mediated virus entry with mean 50% inhibitory titers of 1:7393 and 1:2060, respectively. These data suggest that the RBD of S protein is a major neutralization determinant in the inactivated SARS vaccine which can induce potent neutralizing antibodies to block SARS-CoV entry. However, caution should be taken in using the inactivated SARS-CoV as a vaccine since it may also cause harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses.

    > Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious infectious threat to public health. To create a novel trial vaccine and evaluate its potency, we attempted to generate a SARS inactivated vaccine using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain F69 treated with formaldehyde and mixed with Al(OH)3. Three doses of the vaccine were used to challenge three groups of BALB/c mice. We found that the mice exhibited specific IgM on day 4 and IgG on day 8. The peak titers of IgG were at day 47 in low-dose group (1:19,200) and high-dose group (1:38,400) whereas in middle-dose group (1:19,200), the peak was at day 40. On day 63, the IgG levels reached a plateau. Neutralization assay demonstrated that the antisera could protect Vero-E6 cells from SARS-CoV's infection. Analysis of the antibody specificity revealed that the mouse antisera contained a mixture of antibodies specifically against the structure proteins of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the mouse antisera conferred higher amount of antibodies against protein N, polypeptide S4 and S2 than those of proteins M and 3CL. These findings suggest that the inactivated SARS-CoV could preserve its antigenicity and the inactivated vaccine can stimulate mice to produce high levels of antibodies with neutralization activity. Results also suggest that polypeptides originating from protein N or S might be a potential target for the generation of a recombinant SARS vaccine.

    > Abstract
      In this review, the current state of vaccine development against human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, focusing on recently published data is assessed. We discuss which strategies have been assessed immunologically and which have been evaluated in SARS coronavirus challenge models. We discuss inactivated vaccines, virally and bacterially vectored vaccines, recombinant protein and DNA vaccines, as well as the use of attenuated vaccines. Data regarding the correlates of protection, animal models and the available evidence regarding potential vaccine enhancement of SARS disease are discussed. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge. Current data suggest that intranasal vaccination may be crucial and that new or combination strategies may be required for good protective efficacy against SARS in humans.

    # quote !a = These data provide a cautionary note about SARS rodent models, and indicate that the induction of strong neutralizing antibodies does not equate with protective efficacy in a relevant animal model where clinical signs are apparent and significant lung damage is seen. The ability of an antibody to neutralize virus infection is the easiest activity to measure, but it is not the only important function of antibody in antiviral defense. An important lesson may be drawn from the field of poxvirology where one of the most protective antigens (A33R) generates protective antibodies that are not neutralizing
