  // Central nervous system control of food intake and body weight

    head = The physiological importance of this homeostatic control system is highlighted by the severe obesity that results from dysfunction of any of several of its key components. This new information provides a biological context within which to consider the global obesity epidemic and identifies numerous potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and future research.

    > Abstract
      The capacity to adjust food intake in response to changing energy requirements is essential for survival. Recent progress has provided an insight into the molecular, cellular and behavioural mechanisms that link changes of body fat stores to adaptive adjustments of feeding behaviour. The physiological importance of this homeostatic control system is highlighted by the severe obesity that results from dysfunction of any of several of its key components. This new information provides a biological context within which to consider the global obesity epidemic and identifies numerous potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and future research.

  // The nutrition transition in Cuba in the nineties: an overview
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12596
  ref 'Rodríguez-Ojea_et_al_12_06_2006
    head = To describe and analyse the changes in diet, physical activity and body composition of the Cuban population during the 1990s and the health implications of these changes- Data on national food balance and physical activity are from government agencies and the Ministry of Public Health; nation-wide and local representative surveys were used to analyse body composition and leisure activities.

    > Objective
      To describe and analyse the changes in diet, physical activity and body composition of the Cuban population during the 1990s and the health implications of these changes.

    > Design and setting
      Data on national food balance and physical activity are from government agencies and the Ministry of Public Health; nation-wide and local representative surveys were used to analyse body composition and leisure activities. Data on morbidity and mortality arefrom the Ministry of Public Health.

    > Results
      The collapse of the European socialist countries and the Soviet Union, as well as the reinforced United States' blockade, provoked a sudden shortage of fuel, raw materials, imported foods and essential supplies. Per capita energy availability decreased, physical activity increased, and the prevalence of obesity decreased. Nutrition deficiencies were observed in the early 1990s, while the trend of morbidity from non-communicable disease continued to increase. The nutrition transition characteristics following the economic recovery in 1995–1996 resembled those of the 1980s because of the increased food availability, decreased physical activity and increased obesity prevalence.

    > Conclusions
      Programmes to deal with the complex situation generated a response in a remarkably short time. Undesirable changes in diet composition and the reduction of physical activity constitute a challenge in the current post-critical stage that must be prevented.

    > Abstract
      Cuba's economic crisis of 1989–2000 resulted in reduced energy intake, increased physical activity, and sustained population-wide weight loss. The authors evaluated the possible association of these factors with mortality trends. Data on per capita daily energy intake, physical activity, weight loss, and smoking were systematically retrieved from national and local surveys. National vital statistics from 1980–2005 were used to assess trends in mortality from diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and all causes. The crisis reduced per capita daily energy intake from 2,899 calories to 1,863 calories. During the crisis period, the proportion of physically active adults increased from 30% to 67%, and a 1.5-unit shift in the body mass index distribution was observed, along with a change in the distribution of body mass index categories. The prevalence of obesity declined from 14% to 7%, the prevalence of overweight increased 1%, and the prevalence of normal weight increased 4%. During 1997–2002, there were declines in deaths attributed to diabetes (51%), coronary heart disease (35%), stroke (20%), and all causes (18%). An outbreak of neuropathy and a modest increase in the all-cause death rate among the elderly were also observed. These results suggest that population-wide measures designed to reduce energy stores, without affecting nutritional sufficiency, may lead to declines in diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevalence and mortality.

    > Abstract
      A low sodium diet has often been implicated in the protection of low blood pressure populations from hypertension, but several other dietary factors, including those as yet unidentified, may also be involved. The Kuna Indians of Panama are free of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, but this is changing with migration to urban areas. We compared the indigenous diet of Kuna Indians living on remote islands in Panama (Ailigandi), whose lifestyle is largely hunter-gatherer, with those who have moved to a suburb of Panama City (Vera Cruz). Between April and October 1999, members of a Kuna research team administered a 118-item food frequency questionnaire to133 adult Kuna from Ailigandi and 183 from Vera Cruz. Single 24-hour urine collections and nonfasting blood samples were obtained. The Kuna in Ailigandi reported consuming a 10-fold higher amount of cocoa-containing beverages, 4 times the amount of fish, and twice the amount of fruit as urban Kuna (P<0.05 by t test). Salt added was ample among those living in Ailigandi and Vera Cruz according to both self-report (7.1±1.1 and 4.6±0.3 tsp weekly) and urinary sodium levels (177±9 and 160±7 mEq Na/g creatinine), respectively. The low blood pressure of island-dwelling Kuna does not seem to be related to a low salt diet. Among dietary factors that varied among migrating Kuna, the notably higher intake of flavanol-rich cocoa is a potential candidate for further study.

    > Abstract
      The indigenous Kuna who live on islands in the Panamanian Caribbean were among the first communities described with little age-related rise in blood pressure or hypertension. Our goals in this study were to ascertain whether isolated island-dwelling Kuna continue to show this pattern, whether migration to Panama City and its environs changed the patterns, and whether the island-dwelling Kuna have maintained their normal blood pressure levels despite partial acculturation, reflected in an increased salt intake. We enrolled 316 Kuna participants who ranged in age from 18 to 82 years. In 50, homogeneity was confirmed by documentation of an O+ blood group. In 92 island dwellers, diastolic hypertension was not identified and blood pressure levels were as low in volunteers over 60 years of age as in those between 20 and 30 years of age. In Panama City, conversely, hypertension prevalence was 10.7% and exceeded 45% in those over 60 years of age (P<.01), blood pressure levels were higher in the elderly, and there was a statistically significant positive relationship between age and blood pressure (P<.01). In Kuna Nega, a Panama City suburb designed to maintain a traditional Kuna lifestyle but with access to the city, all findings were intermediate. Sodium intake and excretion assessed in 50 island-dwelling Kuna averaged 135±15 mEq/g creatinine per 24 hours, exceeding substantially other communities free of hypertension and an age-related rise in blood pressure. Despite partial acculturation, the island-dwelling Kuna Indians are protected from hypertension and thus provide an attractive population for examining alternative mechanisms.

  // Metabolic Studies in the African Pygmy

  ref 'Merimee_et_al_02_01_1972
    head = Major metabolic effects of human growth hormone (HGH) were assessed in the African Babinga pygmy.

    >
      Major metabolic effects of human growth hormone (HGH) were assessed in the African Babinga pygmy. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and glucose concentrations were measured in pygmies, HGH-deficient dwarfs, Bantu tribesmen, and Caucasian controls after each received 4 mg of HGH intravenously over a 20 min period. Pygmies had an early decrease of plasma FFA and glucose concentration, but did not exhibit a later lipolytic response.

      In neighboring Bantu tribesmen, American controls, and HGH-deficient dwarfs, both the early and late responses to intravenous HGH were present. The failure of plasma FFA concentration to increase in the pygmy after intravenous HGH was not due to a generalized defect in lipolysis since a normal lipolytic response was obtained with epinephrine (2 μg/min for 20 min).

      Pygmies, like HGH-deficient dwarfs, had significantly reduced insulin responses to both oral glucose and arginine. Insulin secretion was significantly reduced when compared with either Bantu tribesmen or American controls and was not altered by 2 wk of a high carbohydrate/high protein diet. HGH treatment in pygmies (5 mg b.i.d. for 5 days) failed to augment either glucose or arginine-induced insulin secretion. Glucagon consistently caused normal insulin secretion in HGH-deficient dwarfs and was, likewise, effective in each pygmy studied. In two offspring from different pygmy mothers and Bantu fathers, insulin responses to glucose were initially normal and increased in a normal manner after HGH treatment.

      In previous studies, HGH failed to reduce serum urea nitrogen concentration in pygmies. Sulfation factor was found to be normal. A consideration of the data in toto is consistent with a hypothesis that the metabolic findings in the pygmy may result from partial nonresponsiveness to either HGH or to a factor generated by HGH. This defect is not transmitted as either an autosomal or sex-linked dominant trait.

  // Physical activity patterns and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in hunter-gatherers
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.22919
  ref 'Raichlen_et_al_10_09_2016
    head = We measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using continuous heart rate monitoring in 46 participants recruited from two Hadza camps. As part of a larger survey of health in the Hadza, we measured blood pressure (n = 198) and biomarkers of cardiovascular health (n = 23) including C-reactive protein, cholesterol (Total, HDL, and LDL), and triglycerides.

    > Objectives
      Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular health, yet few humans living in industrialized societies meet current recommendations (150 min/week). Researchers have long suggested that human physiological requirements for aerobic exercise reflect an evolutionary shift to a hunting and gathering foraging strategy, and a recent transition to more sedentary lifestyles likely represents a mismatch with our past in terms of physical activity. The goal of this study is to explore this mismatch by characterizing MVPA and cardiovascular health in the Hadza, a modern hunting and gathering population living in Northern Tanzania.

    > Methods
      We measured MVPA using continuous heart rate monitoring in 46 participants recruited from two Hadza camps. As part of a larger survey of health in the Hadza, we measured blood pressure (n = 198) and biomarkers of cardiovascular health (n = 23) including C-reactive protein, cholesterol (Total, HDL, and LDL), and triglycerides.

    > Results
      We show that Hadza participants spend large amounts of time in MVPA (134.92 ± 8.6 min/day), and maintain these activity levels across the lifespan. In fact, the Hadza engage in over 14 times as much MVPA as subjects participating in large epidemiological studies in the United States. We found no evidence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this population (low prevalence of hypertension across the lifespan, optimal levels for biomarkers of cardiovascular health).

    > Conclusions
      Our results provide evidence that the hunting and gathering foraging strategy involves high levels of MVPA, supporting the evolutionary medicine model for the relationship between MVPA and cardiovascular health.

  ref 'Pontzer_et_al_07_25_2012
    head = In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts.

    > Abstract
      Western lifestyles differ markedly from those of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and these differences in diet and activity level are often implicated in the global obesity pandemic. However, few physiological data for hunter-gatherer populations are available to test these models of obesity. In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts. As expected, physical activity level, PAL, was greater among Hadza foragers than among Westerners. Nonetheless, average daily energy expenditure of traditional Hadza foragers was no different than that of Westerners after controlling for body size. The metabolic cost of walking (kcal kg−1 m−1) and resting (kcal kg−1 s−1) were also similar among Hadza and Western groups. The similarity in metabolic rates across a broad range of cultures challenges current models of obesity suggesting that Western lifestyles lead to decreased energy expenditure. We hypothesize that human daily energy expenditure may be an evolved physiological trait largely independent of cultural differences.

    > Abstract
      Honey is the most energy dense food in nature. It is therefore not surprising that, where it exists, honey is an important food for almost all hunter-gatherers. Here we describe and analyze widespread honey collecting among foragers and show that where it is absent, in arctic and subarctic habitats, honey bees are also rare to absent. Second, we focus on one hunter-gatherer society, the Hadza of Tanzania. Hadza men and women both rank honey as their favorite food. Hadza acquire seven types of honey. Hadza women usually acquire honey that is close to the ground while men often climb tall baobab trees to raid the largest bee hives with stinging bees. Honey accounts for a substantial proportion of the kilocalories in the Hadza diet, especially that of Hadza men. Cross-cultural forager data reveal that in most hunter-gatherers, men acquire more honey than women but often, as with the Hadza, women do acquire some. Virtually all warm-climate foragers consume honey. Our closest living relatives, the great apes, take honey when they can. We suggest that honey has been part of the diet of our ancestors dating back to at least the earliest hominins. The earliest hominins, however, would have surely been less capable of acquiring as much honey as more recent, fully modern human hunter-gatherers. We discuss reasons for thinking our early ancestors would have acquired less honey than foragers ethnographically described, yet still significantly more than our great ape relatives.

  // Prevalence of and Trends in Diabetes Among Adults in the United States, 1988-2012
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2015.10029
  ref 'Menke_et_al_09_08_2015
    head = Cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1988-1994 and 1999-2012 of nationally representative samples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population; 2781 adults from 2011-2012 were used to estimate recent prevalence and an additional 23 634 adults from 1988-2010 were used to estimate trends.


    > Importance
      Previous studies have shown increasing prevalence of diabetes in the United States. New US data are available to estimate prevalence of and trends in diabetes.

    > Objective
      To estimate the recent prevalence and update US trends in total diabetes, diagnosed diabetes, and undiagnosed diabetes using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      Cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1988-1994 and 1999-2012 of nationally representative samples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population; 2781 adults from 2011-2012 were used to estimate recent prevalence and an additional 23 634 adults from 1988-2010 were used to estimate trends.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      The prevalence of diabetes was defined using a previous diagnosis of diabetes or, if diabetes was not previously diagnosed, by (1) a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5% or greater or a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 126 mg/dL or greater (hemoglobin A1c or FPG definition) or (2) additionally including 2-hour plasma glucose (2-hour PG) level of 200 mg/dL or greater (hemoglobin A1c, FPG, or 2-hour PG definition). Prediabetes was defined as a hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, an FPG level of 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL, or a 2-hour PG level of 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL.

    > Results
      In the overall 2011-2012 population, the unadjusted prevalence (using the hemoglobin A1c, FPG, or 2-hour PG definitions for diabetes and prediabetes) was 14.3% (95% CI, 12.2%-16.8%) for total diabetes, 9.1% (95% CI, 7.8%-10.6%) for diagnosed diabetes, 5.2% (95% CI, 4.0%-6.9%) for undiagnosed diabetes, and 38.0% (95% CI, 34.7%-41.3%) for prediabetes; among those with diabetes, 36.4% (95% CI, 30.5%-42.7%) were undiagnosed. The unadjusted prevalence of total diabetes (using the hemoglobin A1c or FPG definition) was 12.3% (95% CI, 10.8%-14.1%); among those with diabetes, 25.2% (95% CI, 21.1%-29.8%) were undiagnosed. Compared with non-Hispanic white participants (11.3% [95% CI, 9.0%-14.1%]), the age-standardized prevalence of total diabetes (using the hemoglobin A1c, FPG, or 2-hour PG definition) was higher among non-Hispanic black participants (21.8% [95% CI, 17.7%-26.7%]; P < .001), non-Hispanic Asian participants (20.6% [95% CI, 15.0%-27.6%]; P = .007), and Hispanic participants (22.6% [95% CI, 18.4%-27.5%]; P < .001). The age-standardized percentage of cases that were undiagnosed was higher among non-Hispanic Asian participants (50.9% [95% CI, 38.3%-63.4%]; P = .004) and Hispanic participants (49.0% [95% CI, 40.8%-57.2%]; P = .02) than all other racial/ethnic groups. The age-standardized prevalence of total diabetes (using the hemoglobin A1c or FPG definition) increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 8.9%-10.6%) in 1988-1994 to 10.8% (95% CI, 9.5%-12.0%) in 2001-2002 to 12.4% (95% CI, 10.8%-14.2%) in 2011-2012 (P < .001 for trend) and increased significantly in every age group, in both sexes, in every racial/ethnic group, by all education levels, and in all poverty income ratio tertiles.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In 2011-2012, the estimated prevalence of diabetes was 12% to 14% among US adults, depending on the criteria used, with a higher prevalence among participants who were non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic. Between 1988-1994 and 2011-2012, the prevalence of diabetes increased in the overall population and in all subgroups evaluated.

  // Worldwide trends in dietary sugars intake
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422414000237
  ref 'Wittekind_et_al_01_27_2015
    head = The purpose of the present review was to collate and review data from national nutrition surveys to examine changes and trends in dietary sugars intake.

    > Abstract
      Estimating trends in dietary intake data is integral to informing national nutrition policy and monitoring progress towards dietary guidelines. Dietary intake of sugars is a controversial public health issue and guidance in relation to recommended intakes is particularly inconsistent. Published data relating to trends in sugars intake are relatively sparse. The purpose of the present review was to collate and review data from national nutrition surveys to examine changes and trends in dietary sugars intake. Only thirteen countries (all in the developed world) appear to report estimates of sugars intake from national nutrition surveys at more than one point in time. Definitions of dietary sugars that were used include ‘total sugars’, ‘non-milk extrinsic sugars’, ‘added sugars’, sucrose' and ‘mono- and disaccharides’. This variability in terminology across countries meant that comparisons were limited to within countries. Hence trends in dietary sugars intake were examined by country for the whole population (where data permitted), and for specific or combined age and sex subpopulations. Findings indicate that in the majority of population comparisons, estimated dietary sugars intake is either stable or decreasing in both absolute (g/d) and relative (% energy) terms. An increase in sugars intake was observed in few countries and only in specific subpopulations. In conclusion, the findings from the present review suggest that, in the main, dietary sugars intake are decreasing or stable. A consistent approach to estimation of dietary sugars intake from national nutrition surveys is required if more valid estimates of changes in dietary sugars intakes are required in the future.

  // Trends in dietary carbohydrate consumption from 1991 to 2008 in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12596
  ref 'Makarem_et_al_03_24_2014
    head = The present study uniquely investigated trends in the intake of dietary carbohydrates and their major food sources from among the Framingham Heart Study Offspring (FOS) cohort (2894 adults aged ≥ 25 years; predominantly white Americans), which had been uniquely tracked for 17 years (1991 to 2008) in the study.

    > Abstract
      The intake of carbohydrates has been evaluated cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally in an ageing American adult population. The aim of the present study was to examine trends in the intake of dietary carbohydrates and their major food sources among the Framingham Heart Study Offspring (FOS) cohort, which had been uniquely tracked for 17 years in the study. The FOS cohort was recruited in 1971–1975. Follow-up examinations were conducted, on average, every 4 years. Dietary data collection began in 1991 (examination 5) using a validated semi-quantitative FFQ. The study included 2894 adults aged ≥ 25 years with complete dietary data in at least three examinations from 1991 to 2008. Descriptive statistics were generated using SAS version 9.3, and a repeated-measures model was used to examine trends in the intake of carbohydrates and their food sources in the whole sample, and by sex and BMI category. Over 17 years of follow-up, the percentage of energy from total carbohydrates (51·0–46·8 %; P for trend < 0·001) and total sugars (18·2–16·6 %; P for trend < 0·001) decreased. There was a decrease in the percentage of energy from fructose (5·4–4·7 %; P for trend < 0·001) and sucrose (9·8–8·8 %; P for trend < 0·001). Dietary fibre intake increased (18·0–19·2 g/d; P for trend < 0·001). The number of weekly servings of yeast bread, soft drinks/soda, cakes/cookies/quick breads/doughnuts, potatoes, milk, pasta, rice and cooked grains, fruit juice/drinks, potato chips/maize chips/popcorn, and lunch foods (e.g. pizzas and burgers) decreased significantly (P for trend < 0·001), while the intake of ready-to-eat cereals, legumes, fruits, dairy products, candy and ice cream/sherbet/frozen yogurt increased significantly (P for trend<0·04). Similar trends were observed when the analyses were stratified by sex and BMI. The present results suggest favourable trends in dietary carbohydrate consumption, but dietary guidelines for fruits, vegetables and fibre were not met in this cohort.

SSBs included soda, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and other sweetened beverages.

    > Background
      Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is a recommended strategy to promote optimal health.

    > Objective
      The objective was to describe trends in SSB consumption among youth and adults in the United States.

    > Design
      We analyzed energy intake from SSBs among 22,367 youth aged 2–19 y and 29,133 adults aged ≥20 y who participated in a 24-h dietary recall as part of NHANES, a nationally representative sample of the US population with a cross-sectional design, between 1999 and 2010. SSBs included soda, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and other sweetened beverages. Patterns of SSB consumption, including location of consumption and meal occasion associated with consumption, were also examined.

    > Results
      In 2009–2010, youth consumed a mean (±SE) of 155 ± 7 kcal/d from SSBs, and adults consumed an age-adjusted mean (±SE) of 151 ± 5 kcal/d from SSBs—a decrease from 1999 to 2000 of 68 kcal/d and 45 kcal/d, respectively (P-trend < 0.001 for each). In 2009–2010, SSBs contributed 8.0% ± 0.4% and 6.9% ± 0.2% of daily energy intake among youth and adults, respectively, which reflected a decrease compared with 1999–2000 (P-trend < 0.001 for both). Decreases in SSB consumption, both in the home and away from home and also with both meals and snacks, occurred over the 12-y study duration (P-trend < 0.01 for each).

    > Conclusion
      A decrease in SSB consumption among youth and adults in the United States was observed between 1999 and 2010.

    head = Ten pairs of normal men were overfed by 5 MJ/d for 21 d with either a carbohydrate-rich or a fat-rich diet (C- and F-group). The two subjects in each pair were requested to follow each other throughout the day to ensure similar physical activity and were otherwise allowed to maintain normal daily life.

    > Abstract
      Ten pairs of normal men were overfed by 5 MJ/d for 21 d with either a carbohydrate-rich or a fat-rich diet (C- and F-group). The two subjects in each pair were requested to follow each other throughout the day to ensure similar physical activity and were otherwise allowed to maintain normal daily life. The increase in body weight, fat free mass and fat mass showed great variation, the mean increases being 1.5 kg, 0.6 kg and 0.9 kg respectively. No significant differences between the C- and F-group were observed. Heat production during sleep did not change during overfeeding. The RQ during sleep was 0.86 and 0.78 in the C- and F-group respectively. The accumulated faecal loss of energy, DM, carbohydrate and protein was significantly higher in the C- compared with the F-group (30, 44, 69 and 51% higher respectively), whereas the fat loss was the same in the two groups. N balance was not different between the C- and F-group and was positive. Fractional contribution from hepatic de novo lipogenesis, as measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis after administration of [1-(13)C]acetate, was 0.20 and 0.03 in the C-group and the F-group respectively. Absolute hepatic de novo lipogenesis in the C-group was on average 211 g per 21 d. Whole-body de novo lipogenesis, as obtained by the difference between fat mass increase and dietary fat available for storage, was positive in six of the ten subjects in the C-group (mean 332 (SEM 191)g per 21 d). The change in plasma leptin concentration was positively correlated with the change in fat mass. Thus, fat storage during overfeeding of isoenergetic amounts of diets rich in carbohydrate or in fat was not significantly different, and carbohydrates seemed to be converted to fat by both hepatic and extrahepatic lipogenesis.

  ref 'Horton_et_al_07_01_1995
    head = We overfed isoenergetic amounts (50% above energy requirements) of fat and carbohydrate (for 14 d each) to nine lean and seven obese men.

    > Abstract
      Both the amount and composition of food eaten influence body-weight regulation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether and by what mechanism excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate. We overfed isoenergetic amounts (50% above energy requirements) of fat and carbohydrate (for 14 d each) to nine lean and seven obese men. A whole-room calorimeter was used to measure energy expenditure and nutrient oxidation on days 0, 1, 7, and 14 of each overfeeding period. From energy and nutrient balances (intake-expenditure) we estimated the amount and composition of energy stored. Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in 75-85% of excess energy being stored. Alternatively, fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure, leading to storage of 90-95% of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate, and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.

Twenty-four women each consumed a sequence of three 2-wk dietary treatments in which 15–20%, 30–35%, or 45–50% of the energy was derived from fat. These diets consisted of foods that were similar in appearance and palatability but differed in the amount of high-fat ingredients used. Relative to their energy consumption on the medium-fat diet, the subjects spontaneously consumed an 11.3% deficit on the low-fat diet and a 15.4% surfeit on the high-fat diet (p less than 0.0001), resulting in significant changes in body weight (p less than 0.001). A small amount of caloric compensation did occur (p less than 0.02), which was greatest in the leanest subjects (p less than 0.03). These results suggest that habitual, unrestricted consumption of low-fat diets may be an effective approach to weight control.

    > Abstract
      To study the influence of diet composition on regulation of body weight, we fed 21 weight-stable subjects (11 lean, 10 obese) high-carbohydrate (HC) and high-fat (HF) diets for 1 wk each. Although diet composition was fixed, total energy intake was unrestricted. Subjects had a higher energy intake on the HF (11 039 ± 2700 kJ/d) than on the HC (10 672 ± 2617 kJ/d) diet (P < 0.05), but energy expenditure was not different between diets. On day 7 of the HC diet, carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation was significantly related to CHO intake with the slope of the regression line 0.99, suggesting that overall CHO balance was near zero. However, the slope of the regression line was greater for obese than for lean subjects. On day 7 of the HF diet, fat oxidation was significantly related to fat intake but the slope of the line was 0.50, suggesting that overall fat balance was positive. However, this relationship was due entirely to lean subjects, with obese subjects showing no relationship between fat intake and oxidation.

In a further study in obese subjects, a novel experimental design was used to assess the satiating efficiency and compensatory response of fat.

    > Abstract
      Three separate experiments in lean subjects confirmed that a 1.52-MJ (362-kcal) carbohydrate supplement at breakfast suppressed appetite 90 min later but had no effect on a test meal given after 270 min. A 1.52-MJ (362-kcal) fat supplement produced no detectable action on measures of appetite at any time point. Therefore, fat and carbohydrate do not have identical effects on the appetite profile. In a further study in obese subjects, a novel experimental design was used to assess the satiating efficiency and compensatory response of fat. Eating from a range of either high-fat or high-carbohydrate foods, obese subjects voluntarily consumed twice as much energy from the fat items, thereby indicating a weak action of fat on satiation. In turn, this large intake of fat exerted a disproportionately weak effect on satiety. These studies suggest that the appetite-control system may have only weak inhibitory mechanisms to prevent the passive overconsumption of dietary fat. The results indicate how this action could induce a positive energy balance and lead to a gradual upward drift in body mass index.

    > Abstract
      The effect of diet composition [high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HC) and high-fat, low-carbohydrate (HF) diets] on macronutrient intakes and nutrient balances was investigated in young men of normal body weight. Eleven subjects were studied on two occasions for 48 h in a whole-body indirect calorimeter in a crossover design. Subjects selected their meals from a list containing a large variety of common food, which had a food quotient > 0.85 for the HC diet and < 0.85 for the HF diet. The average ad libitum intake was 14.41 +/- 0.85 MJ/d (67%, 18%, and 15% of energy as carbohydrate, fat, and protein, respectively) with the HC diet and 18.25 +/- 0.90 MJ/d (26%, 61%, and 13% of energy as carbohydrate, fat, and protein, respectively) with the HF diet. Total energy expenditure was not significantly influenced by diet composition: 10.46 +/- 0.27 and 10.97 +/- 0.22 MJ/d for the HC and HF diets, respectively. During the 2 test days, cumulative carbohydrate storage was 418 +/- 72 and 205 +/- 47 g, and fat balance was 29 +/- 17 and 291 +/- 29 g with the HC and HF diets, respectively. Only the HF diet induced a significantly positive fat balance. These results emphasize the important role of the dietary fat content in body fat storage.

  // Long-term effects of a ketogenic diet in obese patients
  doi: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/
  ref 'Dashti_et_al_2004
    head = In the study, 83 obese patients (39 men and 44 women) with a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m2, and high glucose and cholesterol levels were selected to determine the effects of a 24-week ketogenic diet.

    > Background
      Although various studies have examined the short-term effects of a ketogenic diet in reducing weight in obese patients, its long-term effects on various physical and biochemical parameters are not known.

    > Objective
      To determine the effects of a 24-week ketogenic diet (consisting of 30 g carbohydrate, 1 g/kg body weight protein, 20% saturated fat, and 80% polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat) in obese patients.

    > Patients and Methods
      In the present study, 83 obese patients (39 men and 44 women) with a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m2, and high glucose and cholesterol levels were selected. The body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood sugar, urea and creatinine levels were determined before and after the administration of the ketogenic diet. Changes in these parameters were monitored after eight, 16 and 24 weeks of treatment.

    > Results
      The weight and body mass index of the patients decreased significantly (P<0.0001). The level of total cholesterol decreased from week 1 to week 24. HDL cholesterol levels significantly increased, whereas LDL cholesterol levels significantly decreased after treatment. The level of triglycerides decreased significantly following 24 weeks of treatment. The level of blood glucose significantly decreased. The changes in the level of urea and creatinine were not statistically significant.

    > Conclusions
      The present study shows the beneficial effects of a long-term ketogenic diet. It significantly reduced the body weight and body mass index of the patients. Furthermore, it decreased the level of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and blood glucose, and increased the level of HDL cholesterol. Administering a ketogenic diet for a relatively longer period of time did not produce any significant side effects in the patients. Therefore, the present study confirms that it is safe to use a ketogenic diet for a longer period of time than previously demonstrated.

  ref 'YancyJr_et_al_05_18_2004
    head = Over 24 weeks, 120 Community-dwelling overweight hyperlipidemic persons were randomly assigned to either a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet or a low-fat, low-cholesterol, reduced-calorie diet for 24 weeks.

    > Objective
      To compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet program with those of a low-fat, low-cholesterol, reduced-calorie diet.

    > Design
      Randomized, controlled trial.

    > Setting
      Outpatient research clinic.

    > Participants
      120 overweight, hyperlipidemic volunteers from the community.

    > Intervention
      Low-carbohydrate diet (initially, <20 g of carbohydrate daily) plus nutritional supplementation, exercise recommendation, and group meetings, or low-fat diet (<30% energy from fat, <300 mg of cholesterol daily, and deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal/d) plus exercise recommendation and group meetings.

    > Measurements
      Body weight, body composition, fasting serum lipid levels, and tolerability.

    > Results
      A greater proportion of the low-carbohydrate diet group than the low-fat diet group completed the study (76% vs. 57%; P = 0.02). At 24 weeks, weight loss was greater in the low-carbohydrate diet group than in the low-fat diet group (mean change, −12.9% vs. −6.7%; P < 0.001). Patients in both groups lost substantially more fat mass (change, −9.4 kg with the low-carbohydrate diet vs. −4.8 kg with the low-fat diet) than fat-free mass (change, −3.3 kg vs. −2.4 kg, respectively). Compared with recipients of the low-fat diet, recipients of the low-carbohydrate diet had greater decreases in serum triglyceride levels (change, −0.84 mmol/L vs. −0.31 mmol/L [−74.2 mg/dL vs. −27.9 mg/dL]; P = 0.004) and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (0.14 mmol/L vs. −0.04 mmol/L [5.5 mg/dL vs. −1.6 mg/dL]; P < 0.001). Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level did not differ statistically (0.04 mmol/L [1.6 mg/dL] with the low-carbohydrate diet and −0.19 mmol/L [−7.4 mg/dL] with the low-fat diet; P = 0.2). Minor adverse effects were more frequent in the low-carbohydrate diet group.

    > Limitations
      We could not definitively distinguish effects of the low-carbohydrate diet and those of the nutritional supplements provided only to that group. In addition, participants were healthy and were followed for only 24 weeks. These factors limit the generalizability of the study results.

    > Conclusions
      Compared with a low-fat diet, a low-carbohydrate diet program had better participant retention and greater weight loss. During active weight loss, serum triglyceride levels decreased more and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased more with the low-carbohydrate diet than with the low-fat diet.

    head = In this study the effect of ketogenic diet in 66 healthy obese subjects with high cholesterol level above 6 mmol/, body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 is compared to those those subjects with normal cholesterol level for a period of 56 weeks.

    > Objective
      Various studies have convincingly shown the beneficial effect of ketogenic diet (in which the daily consumption of carbohydrate is less than 20 grams, regardless of fat, protein and caloric intake) in reducing weight in obese subjects. However, its long term effect on obese subjects with high total cholesterol (as compared to obese subjects with normal cholesterol level is lacking. It is believed that ketogenic diet may have adverse effect on the lipid profile. Therefore, in this study the effect of ketogenic diet in obese subjects with high cholesterol level above 6 mmol/L is compared to those with normocholesterolemia for a period of 56 weeks.

    > Materials and methods
      In this study, 66 healthy obese subjects with body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, having high cholesterol level (Group I; n = 35) and those subjects with normal cholesterol level (Group II; n = 31) were selected. The body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, urea, creatinine, glucose and triglycerides were determined before and after the administration of the ketogenic diet. Changes in these parameters were monitored at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56 weeks of the treatment.

    > Results
      The body weight and body mass index of both groups decreased significantly (P < 0.0001). The level of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose level decreased significantly (P < 0.0001), whereas HDL cholesterol increased significantly (P < 0.0001) after the treatment in both groups.

    > Conclusion
      This study shows the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet following its long term administration in obese subjects with a high level of total cholesterol. Moreover, this study demonstrates that low carbohydrate diet is safe to use for a longer period of time in obese subjects with a high total cholesterol level and those with normocholesterolemia.

    > Abstract
      Ketogenic diets have been used as an approach to weight loss on the basis of the theoretical advantage of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. To evaluate the physiological and metabolic effects of such diets on weight we studied mice consuming a very-low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (KD). This diet had profound effects on energy balance and gene expression. C57BL/6 mice animals were fed one of four diets: KD; a commonly used obesogenic high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HF); 66% caloric restriction (CR); and control chow (C). Mice on KD ate the same calories as mice on C and HF, but weight dropped and stabilized at 85% initial weight, similar to CR. This was consistent with increased energy expenditure seen in animals fed KD vs. those on C and CR. Microarray analysis of liver showed a unique pattern of gene expression in KD, with increased expression of genes in fatty acid oxidation pathways and reduction in lipid synthesis pathways. Animals made obese on HF and transitioned to KD lost all excess body weight, improved glucose tolerance, and increased energy expenditure. Analysis of key genes showed similar changes as those seen in lean animals placed directly on KD. Additionally, AMP kinase activity was increased, with a corresponding decrease in ACC activity. These data indicate that KD induces a unique metabolic state congruous with weight loss.

    > Summary
      The impacts of different macronutrients on body weight regulation remain unresolved, with different studies suggesting increased dietary fat, increased carbohydrates (particularly sugars), or reduced protein may all stimulate overconsumption and drive obesity. We exposed C57BL/6 mice to 29 different diets varying from 8.3% to 80% fat, 10% to 80% carbohydrate, 5% to 30% protein, and 5% to 30% sucrose. Only increased dietary fat content was associated with elevated energy intake and adiposity. This response was associated with increased gene expression in the 5-HT receptors, and the dopamine and opioid signaling pathways in the hypothalamus. We replicated the core findings in four other mouse strains (DBA/2, BALB/c, FVB, and C3H). Mice regulate their food consumption primarily to meet an energy rather than a protein target, but this system can be over-ridden by hedonic factors linked to fat, but not sucrose, consumption.

  // Dietary fat, genetic predisposition, and obesity: lessons from animal models

  ref 'West_et_al_03_01_1998
    head = This review focuses on animal studies that examine the role of dietary fat in obesity.

    > Abstract
      This review focuses on animal studies that examine the role of dietary fat in obesity. It is evident from animal experiments that the percentage of energy derived from fat in the diet is positively correlated with body fat content. With few exceptions, obesity is induced by high-fat diets in monkeys, dogs, pigs, hamsters, squirrels, rats, and mice. The mechanisms responsible for this correlation between body fat and dietary fat content are not clear. It has been proposed that a high-fat diet produces hyperphagia, which is solely responsible for the increased body fat content. However, several studies in various rodent models showed that increased body fat content still results when the hyperphagia is prevented. This suggests that some metabolic effects of high-fat diets, independent of hyperphagia, may also be contributing to the obesity induced by high-fat diets. It is also clear from animal studies that genetic factors significantly modulate the body’s response to diets high in fat-derived energy. In contrast with the animal studies, studies in humans that have examined the relation between dietary fat content and body fat are inconclusive. The limitations of cross-sectional studies, the lack of controlled feeding trials, and the importance of genetic variation in response explain the absence of conclusive evidence. The lessons learned from animal models point to dietary fat as one potentially important component in the etiology of human obesity. Additional comprehensive studies are warranted to determine the role of dietary fat in the etiology of human obesity.

This suggests that some metabolic effects of high-fat diets, independent of hyperphagia, may also be contributing to the obesity induced by high-fat diets.

  // Treatment of massive obesity with rice/reduction diet program. An analysis of 106 patients with at least a 45-kg weight loss
  doi: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1200726/
  ref 'Kempner_et_al_1975
    head = One hundred six massively obese patients, who each lost at least 45 kg, were treated as outpatients with the rice/reduction diet, exercise, and motivational enhancement under daily supervision.

    > Abstract
      One hundred six massively obese patients, who each lost at least 45 kg, were treated as outpatients with the rice/reduction diet, exercise, and motivational enhancement under daily supervision. Average weight loss was 63.9 kg. Forty-three patients achieved normal weight. Men lost weight at a greater rate than women. Concomitant with weight reduction, there were significant decrements in blood pressure; fasting and two-hour postprandial blood glucose, serum triglyceride, and serum uric acid levels, and heart-chest ratio as evidenced on chest x-ray film. Electrocardiographic and retinal venous changes improved. Serum cholesterol level did not change significantly. This study demonstrates that massively obese persons can achieve marked weight reduction, even normalization of weight, without hospitalization, surgery, or pharmacologic intervention. Accompanying cardiovascular risk factors show great decrements concomitant with weight loss.

  // The role of low-fat diets in body weight control: a meta-analysis of ad libitum dietary intervention studies
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.0801453
  ref 'Astrup_et_al_12_04_2000
    head = We evaluated the efficacy of ad libitum low-fat diets in reducing body weight in non-diabetic individuals from the results of intervention trials. Two authors independently selected the studies meeting the inclusion criteria and extracted data from 16 trials (duration of 2–12 months) with 19 intervention groups, enrolling 1910 individuals.

    > Objectives
      Low-fat high-carbohydrate diets are recommended to prevent weight gain in normal weight subjects and reduce body weight in overweight and obese. However, their efficacy is controversial. We evaluated the efficacy of ad libitum low-fat diets in reducing body weight in non-diabetic individuals from the results of intervention trials.

    > Design
      Studies were identified from a computerized search of the Medline database from January 1966 to July 1999 and other sources. Inclusion criteria were: controlled trials lasting more than 2 months comparing ad libitum low-fat diets as the sole intervention with a control group consuming habitual diet or a medium-fat diet ad libitum.

    > Main Outcome Measures
      Differences in changes in dietary fat intake, energy intake and body weight. Weighted mean differences for continuous data and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

    > Results
      Two authors independently selected the studies meeting the inclusion criteria and extracted data from 16 trials (duration of 2–12 months) with 19 intervention groups, enrolling 1910 individuals. Fourteen were randomized. Weight loss was not the primary aim in 11 studies. Before the interventions the mean proportions of dietary energy from fat in the studies were 37.7% (95% CI, 36.9–38.5) in the low-fat groups, and 37.4% (36.4–38.4) in the control groups. The low-fat intervention produced a mean fat reduction of 10.2% (8.1–12.3). Low-fat intervention groups showed a greater weight loss than control groups (3.2 kg, 95% confidence interval 1.9–4.5 kg; P<0.0001), and a greater reduction in energy intake (1138 kJ/day, 95% confidence interval 564–1712 kJ/day, P=0.002). Having a body weight 10 kg higher than the average pre-treatment body weight was associated with a 2.6±0.8 kg (P=0.011) greater difference in weight loss.

    > Conclusion
      A reduction in dietary fat without intentional restriction of energy intake causes weight loss, which is more substantial in heavier subjects.

  // Roles of Leptin and Ghrelin in the Loss of Body Weight Caused by a Low Fat, High Carbohydrate Diet
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2002-021262
  ref 'Weigle_et_al_04_01_2003
    head = To clarify the effect of dietary fat restriction on leptin and ghrelin, we measured AUC for these hormones in human subjects after each of the following sequential diets: 2 wk on a weight-maintaining 35% fat (F), 45% carbohydrate (C), 20% protein (P) diet (n = 18); 2 wk on an isocaloric 15% F, 65% C, 20% P diet (n = 18); and 12 wk on an ad libitum 15% F, 65% C, 20% P diet (n = 16).

    > Abstract
      Loss of body fat by caloric restriction is accompanied by decreased circulating leptin levels, increased ghrelin levels, and increased appetite. In contrast, dietary fat restriction often decreases adiposity without increasing appetite. Substitution of dietary carbohydrate for fat has been shown to increase the area under the plasma leptin vs. time curve (AUC) over the course of 24 h. This effect, if sustained, could explain the absence of a compensatory increase in appetite on a low fat diet. To clarify the effect of dietary fat restriction on leptin and ghrelin, we measured AUC for these hormones in human subjects after each of the following sequential diets: 2 wk on a weight-maintaining 35% fat (F), 45% carbohydrate (C), 20% protein (P) diet (n = 18); 2 wk on an isocaloric 15% F, 65% C, 20% P diet (n = 18); and 12 wk on an ad libitum 15% F, 65% C, 20% P diet (n = 16). AUC for leptin was similar on the isocaloric 15% F and 35% F diets (555 ± 57 vs. 580 ± 56 ng/ml·24 h; P = NS). Body weight decreased from 74.6 ± 2.4 to 70.8 ± 2.7 kg on the ad libitum 15% F diet (P < 0.001) without compensatory increases in food consumption or AUC for ghrelin. Proportional amplitude of the 24-h leptin profile was increased after 12 wk on the 15% fat diet. We conclude that weight loss early in the course of dietary fat restriction occurs independently of increased plasma leptin levels, but that a later increase in amplitude of the 24-h leptin signal may contribute to ongoing weight loss. Fat restriction avoids the increase in ghrelin levels caused by dietary energy restriction.

These observations suggest that dietary fat restriction enhances leptin sensitivity in the CNS and the periphery, an inference that remains to be proven by future studies in which leptin is administered directly to humans consuming diets of differing fat content.

  // Effect of Low-Fat vs Low-Carbohydrate Diet on 12-Month Weight Loss in Overweight Adults and the Association With Genotype Pattern or Insulin Secretion The DIETFITS Randomized Clinical Trial
  doi: https://doi.org/0.1001/jama.2018.0245
  ref 'Gardner_et_al_02_20_2018
    head = The Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) randomized clinical trial included 609 adults aged 18 to 50 years without diabetes with a body mass index between 28 and 40. Participants were randomized to the 12-month HLF or HLC diet. The study also tested whether 3 single-nucleotide polymorphism multilocus genotype responsiveness patterns or insulin secretion (INS-30; blood concentration of insulin 30 minutes after a glucose challenge) were associated with weight loss.

    > Importance
      Dietary modification remains key to successful weight loss. Yet, no one dietary strategy is consistently superior to others for the general population. Previous research suggests genotype or insulin-glucose dynamics may modify the effects of diets.

    > Objective
      To determine the effect of a healthy low-fat (HLF) diet vs a healthy low-carbohydrate (HLC) diet on weight change and if genotype pattern or insulin secretion are related to the dietary effects on weight loss.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      The Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) randomized clinical trial included 609 adults aged 18 to 50 years without diabetes with a body mass index between 28 and 40. The trial enrollment was from January 29, 2013, through April 14, 2015; the date of final follow-up was May 16, 2016. Participants were randomized to the 12-month HLF or HLC diet. The study also tested whether 3 single-nucleotide polymorphism multilocus genotype responsiveness patterns or insulin secretion (INS-30; blood concentration of insulin 30 minutes after a glucose challenge) were associated with weight loss.

    > Interventions
      Health educators delivered the behavior modification intervention to HLF (n = 305) and HLC (n = 304) participants via 22 diet-specific small group sessions administered over 12 months. The sessions focused on ways to achieve the lowest fat or carbohydrate intake that could be maintained long-term and emphasized diet quality.

    > Main Outcomes and Measures
      Primary outcome was 12-month weight change and determination of whether there were significant interactions among diet type and genotype pattern, diet and insulin secretion, and diet and weight loss.

    > Results
      Among 609 participants randomized (mean age, 40 [SD, 7] years; 57% women; mean body mass index, 33 [SD, 3]; 244 [40%] had a low-fat genotype; 180 [30%] had a low-carbohydrate genotype; mean baseline INS-30, 93 μIU/mL), 481 (79%) completed the trial. In the HLF vs HLC diets, respectively, the mean 12-month macronutrient distributions were 48% vs 30% for carbohydrates, 29% vs 45% for fat, and 21% vs 23% for protein. Weight change at 12 months was −5.3 kg for the HLF diet vs −6.0 kg for the HLC diet (mean between-group difference, 0.7 kg [95% CI, −0.2 to 1.6 kg]). There was no significant diet-genotype pattern interaction (P = .20) or diet-insulin secretion (INS-30) interaction (P = .47) with 12-month weight loss. There were 18 adverse events or serious adverse events that were evenly distributed across the 2 diet groups.

    > Conclusions and Relevance
      In this 12-month weight loss diet study, there was no significant difference in weight change between a healthy low-fat diet vs a healthy low-carbohydrate diet, and neither genotype pattern nor baseline insulin secretion was associated with the dietary effects on weight loss. In the context of these 2 common weight loss diet approaches, neither of the 2 hypothesized predisposing factors was helpful in identifying which diet was better for whom.

    head = We compared the effects of diets varying in carbohydrate to fat ratio on energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance through 20 weeks.

    > Objective
      To determine the effects of diets varying in carbohydrate to fat ratio on total energy expenditure.

    > Design
      Randomized trial

    > Setting
      Multicenter collaboration at US two sites, August 2014 to May 2017.

    > Participants
      164 adults aged 18-65 years with a body mass index of 25 or more.

    > Interventions
      After 12% (within 2%) weight loss on a run-in diet, participants were randomly assigned to one of three test diets according to carbohydrate content (high, 60%, n=54; moderate, 40%, n=53; or low, 20%, n=57) for 20 weeks. Test diets were controlled for protein and were energy adjusted to maintain weight loss within 2 kg. To test for effect modification predicted by the carbohydrate-insulin model, the sample was divided into thirds of pre-weight loss insulin secretion (insulin concentration 30 minutes after oral glucose).

    > Main outcome measures
      The primary outcome was total energy expenditure, measured with doubly labeled water, by intention-to-treat analysis. Per protocol analysis included participants who maintained target weight loss, potentially providing a more precise effect estimate. Secondary outcomes were resting energy expenditure, measures of physical activity, and levels of the metabolic hormones leptin and ghrelin.

    > Results
      Total energy expenditure differed by diet in the intention-to-treat analysis (n=162, P=0.002), with a linear trend of 52 kcal/d (95% confidence interval 23 to 82) for every 10% decrease in the contribution of carbohydrate to total energy intake (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ). Change in total energy expenditure was 91 kcal/d (95% confidence interval −29 to 210) greater in participants assigned to the moderate carbohydrate diet and 209 kcal/d (91 to 326) greater in those assigned to the low carbohydrate diet compared with the high carbohydrate diet. In the per protocol analysis (n=120, P<0.001), the respective differences were 131 kcal/d (−6 to 267) and 278 kcal/d (144 to 411). Among participants in the highest third of pre-weight loss insulin secretion, the difference between the low and high carbohydrate diet was 308 kcal/d in the intention-to-treat analysis and 478 kcal/d in the per protocol analysis (P<0.004). Ghrelin was significantly lower in participants assigned to the low carbohydrate diet compared with those assigned to the high carbohydrate diet (both analyses). Leptin was also significantly lower in participants assigned to the low carbohydrate diet (per protocol).

    > Conclusions
      Consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model, lowering dietary carbohydrate increased energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance. This metabolic effect may improve the success of obesity treatment, especially among those with high insulin secretion.

  ref 'Grey_et_al_10_07_1971
    head = During two successive three-week periods, seven obese subjects were fed isocaloric diets, the first low, the second high in carbohydrate.

    > Abstract
      During two successive three-week periods, seven obese subjects were fed isocaloric diets, the first low, the second high in carbohydrate. In all, basal plasma insulin levels decreased 50 per cent on the low-carbohydrate diet and increased on the high-carbohydrate diet. Three obese subjects were fed, during three successive four-week periods, 1500-calorie diets with high, then low, and then high-carbohydrate content. Basal plasma insulin levels were significantly reduced on the low-carbohydrate diet. Refeeding of the high-carbohydrate diet, despite continued weight loss, resulted in markedly increased basal plasma insulin. In both protocols, most patients also exhibited a decreased insulin secretory response to oral glucose when on a low intake of carbohydrate and an increased response on a high intake.

      Thus the hyperinsulinemia characteristic of obesity may be a result, in part, of dietary factors rather than exclusively a consequence of the insulin antagonism associated with obesity.

    head = In this review, for pedagogic clarity, we reframe the theoretical discussion to directly link thermodynamic inefficiency to weight change.

If so, what biochemical mechanisms might plausibly explain it? Finally, what experimental evidence exists to determine whether it does or does not occur?

    > Background
      It is commonly held that "a calorie is a calorie", i.e. that diets of equal caloric content will result in identical weight change independent of macronutrient composition, and appeal is frequently made to the laws of thermodynamics. We have previously shown that thermodynamics does not support such a view and that diets of different macronutrient content may be expected to induce different changes in body mass. Low carbohydrate diets in particular have claimed a "metabolic advantage" meaning more weight loss than in isocaloric diets of higher carbohydrate content. In this review, for pedagogic clarity, we reframe the theoretical discussion to directly link thermodynamic inefficiency to weight change. The problem in outline: Is metabolic advantage theoretically possible? If so, what biochemical mechanisms might plausibly explain it?

    > Results
      Reduced thermodynamic efficiency will result in increased weight loss. The laws of thermodynamics are silent on the existence of variable thermodynamic efficiency in metabolic processes. Therefore such variability is permitted and can be related to differences in weight lost. The existence of variable efficiency and metabolic advantage is therefore an empiric question rather than a theoretical one, confirmed by many experimental isocaloric studies, pending a properly performed meta-analysis. Mechanisms are as yet unknown, but plausible mechanisms at the metabolic level are proposed.

    > Conclusions
      Variable thermodynamic efficiency due to dietary manipulation is permitted by physical laws, is supported by much experimental data, and may be reasonably explained by plausible mechanisms.

  // Effects of Dietary Composition on Energy Expenditure During Weight-Loss Maintenance
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2012.6607
  ref 'Ebbeling_et_al_06_27_2012
    head = A controlled 3-way crossover design involving 21 overweight and obese young adults conducted at Children's Hospital Boston and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, between June 16, 2006, and June 21, 2010- examine the effects of 3 diets differing widely in macronutrient composition and glycemic load on energy expenditure following weight loss.

    > Context
      Reduced energy expenditure following weight loss is thought to contribute to weight gain. However, the effect of dietary composition on energy expenditure during weight-loss maintenance has not been studied.

    > Objective
      To examine the effects of 3 diets differing widely in macronutrient composition and glycemic load on energy expenditure following weight loss.

    > Design, Setting, and Participants
      A controlled 3-way crossover design involving 21 overweight and obese young adults conducted at Children's Hospital Boston and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, between June 16, 2006, and June 21, 2010, with recruitment by newspaper advertisements and postings.

    > Intervention
      After achieving 10% to 15% weight loss while consuming a run-in diet, participants consumed an isocaloric low-fat diet (60% of energy from carbohydrate, 20% from fat, 20% from protein; high glycemic load), low–glycemic index diet (40% from carbohydrate, 40% from fat, and 20% from protein; moderate glycemic load), and very low-carbohydrate diet (10% from carbohydrate, 60% from fat, and 30% from protein; low glycemic load) in random order, each for 4 weeks.

    > Main Outcome Measures
      Primary outcome was resting energy expenditure (REE), with secondary outcomes of total energy expenditure (TEE), hormone levels, and metabolic syndrome components.

    > Results
      Compared with the pre–weight-loss baseline, the decrease in REE was greatest with the low-fat diet (mean [95% CI], –205 [–265 to –144] kcal/d), intermediate with the low–glycemic index diet (–166 [–227 to –106] kcal/d), and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet (−138 [–198 to –77] kcal/d; overall P = .03; P for trend by glycemic load = .009). The decrease in TEE showed a similar pattern (mean [95% CI], −423 [–606 to –239] kcal/d; −297 [–479 to –115] kcal/d; and −97 [–281 to 86] kcal/d, respectively; overall P = .003; P for trend by glycemic load < .001). Hormone levels and metabolic syndrome components also varied during weight maintenance by diet (leptin, P < .001; 24-hour urinary cortisol, P = .005; indexes of peripheral [P = .02] and hepatic [P = .03] insulin sensitivity; high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, P < .001; non-HDL cholesterol, P < .001; triglycerides, P < .001; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, P for trend = .04; and C-reactive protein, P for trend = .05), but no consistent favorable pattern emerged.

    > Conclusion
      Among overweight and obese young adults compared with pre–weight-loss energy expenditure, isocaloric feeding following 10% to 15% weight loss resulted in decreases in REE and TEE that were greatest with the low-fat diet, intermediate with the low–glycemic index diet, and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet.

    > Abstract
      The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of diets that were equally low in energy but widely different in relative amounts of fat and carbohydrate on body weight during a 6-wk period of hospitalization. Consequently, 43 adult, obese persons were randomly assigned to receive diets containing 4.2 MJ/d (1000 kcal/d) composed of either 32% protein, 15% carbohydrate, and 53% fat, or 29% protein, 45% carbohydrate, and 26% fat. There was no significant difference in the amount of weight loss in response to diets containing either 15% (8.9 +/- 0.6 kg) or 45% (7.5 +/- 0.5 kg) carbohydrate. Furthermore, significant decreases in total body fat and waist-to-hip circumference were seen in both groups, and the magnitude of the changes did not vary as a function of diet composition. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations decreased significantly in patients eating low-energy diets that contained 15% carbohydrate, but neither plasma insulin nor triacylglycerol concentrations fell significantly in response to the higher-carbohydrate diet. The results of this study showed that it was energy intake, not nutrient composition, that determined weight loss in response to low-energy diets over a short time period.

      The persistence of an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes suggests that new nutritional strategies are needed if the epidemic is to be overcome. A promising nutritional approach suggested by this thematic review is carbohydrate restriction. Recent studies show that, under conditions of carbohydrate restriction, fuel sources shift from glucose and fatty acids to fatty acids and ketones, and that ad libitum–fed carbohydrate-restricted diets lead to appetite reduction, weight loss, and improvement in surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease.

  // Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561
  ref 'Hall_et_al_07_06_2016
    head = We investigated whether an isocaloric low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is associated with changes in energy expenditure (EE), respiratory quotient (RQ), and body composition. Seventeen overweight or obese men were admitted to metabolic wards, where they consumed a high-carbohydrate baseline diet (BD) for 4 wk followed by 4 wk of an isocaloric KD with clamped protein.

    > Background
      The carbohydrate–insulin model of obesity posits that habitual consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet sequesters fat within adipose tissue because of hyperinsulinemia and results in adaptive suppression of energy expenditure (EE). Therefore, isocaloric exchange of dietary carbohydrate for fat is predicted to result in increased EE, increased fat oxidation, and loss of body fat. In contrast, a more conventional view that “a calorie is a calorie” predicts that isocaloric variations in dietary carbohydrate and fat will have no physiologically important effects on EE or body fat.

    > Objective
      We investigated whether an isocaloric low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is associated with changes in EE, respiratory quotient (RQ), and body composition.

    > Design
      Seventeen overweight or obese men were admitted to metabolic wards, where they consumed a high-carbohydrate baseline diet (BD) for 4 wk followed by 4 wk of an isocaloric KD with clamped protein. Subjects spent 2 consecutive days each week residing in metabolic chambers to measure changes in EE (EEchamber), sleeping EE (SEE), and RQ. Body composition changes were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Average EE during the final 2 wk of the BD and KD periods was measured by doubly labeled water (EEDLW).

    > Results
      Subjects lost weight and body fat throughout the study corresponding to an overall negative energy balance of ~300 kcal/d. Compared with BD, the KD coincided with increased EE chamber (57 ± 13 kcal/d, P = 0.0004) and SEE (89 ± 14 kcal/d, P < 0.0001) and decreased RQ (−0.111 ± 0.003, P < 0.0001). EEDLW increased by 151 ± 63 kcal/d (P = 0.03). Body fat loss slowed during the KD and coincided with increased protein utilization and loss of fat-free mass.

    > Conclusion
      The isocaloric KD was not accompanied by increased body fat loss but was associated with relatively small increases in EE that were near the limits of detection with the use of state-of-the-art technology. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01967563.

    quote !c = These data, although somewhat confounded by ongoing weight loss, suggest that large isocaloric changes in the proportion of dietary carbohydrate to fat transiently increase EE by only ~100 kcal/d after adjusting for body weight and composition.

    quote !d = A conventional view is that the proportion of carbohydrate to fat in the diet has a physiologically negligible effect on EE when dietary protein and energy intake are held constant. In contrast, the carbohydrate–insulin model predicts that the KD would lead to increased EE, thereby resulting in a metabolic advantage amounting to ~300–600 kcal/d. Our data do not support EE increases of that magnitude.

    > Abstract
      Eight men were fed at maintenance for 2 wk, followed by 4 wk at 50% of maintenance, then 1 wk at maintenance. The diets were formulated to contain either 40% or 20% of energy from fat. Daily energy expenditure (24-h EE) was determined by indirect calorimetry at the end of the 2-wk maintenance period; on days 1, 7, and 28 of reduced energy intake; and on days 1 and 7 of refeeding. During the reduced-energy period, body weight decreased from 96.6 to 91.5 kg and body fat decreased from 30.4% to 27.7%. There were no significant differences in 24-h EE or energy requirements per unit body weight due to diet composition or weight loss. Maintenance metabolizable-energy (ME) requirement averaged 31.0 kcal/kg body wt. Overall, the efficiency of ME use relative to body stores was 0.87 and was greater for high-fat than for low-fat diets. There was some evidence of an increase in the efficiency of energy use of body stores after weight loss. Substrate use reflected diet composition and energy-balance status independent of changes in body composition.

    > Summary
      Dietary carbohydrate restriction has been purported to cause endocrine adaptations that promote body fat loss more than dietary fat restriction. We selectively restricted dietary carbohydrate versus fat for 6 days following a 5-day baseline diet in 19 adults with obesity confined to a metabolic ward where they exercised daily. Subjects received both isocaloric diets in random order during each of two inpatient stays. Body fat loss was calculated as the difference between daily fat intake and net fat oxidation measured while residing in a metabolic chamber. Whereas carbohydrate restriction led to sustained increases in fat oxidation and loss of 53 ± 6 g/day of body fat, fat oxidation was unchanged by fat restriction, leading to 89 ± 6 g/day of fat loss, and was significantly greater than carbohydrate restriction (p = 0.002). Mathematical model simulations agreed with these data, but predicted that the body acts to minimize body fat differences with prolonged isocaloric diets varying in carbohydrate and fat.

  ref 'Raatz_et_al_10_01_2005
    head = A parallel-design, randomized 12-wk controlled feeding trial with a 24-wk follow-up phase was conducted to test the hypothesis that a hypocaloric diet designed to reduce the glycemic load and the glycemic index would result in greater sustained weight loss than other hypocaloric diets.

    > Abstract
      Reducing the dietary glycemic load and the glycemic index was proposed as a novel approach to weight reduction. A parallel-design, randomized 12-wk controlled feeding trial with a 24-wk follow-up phase was conducted to test the hypothesis that a hypocaloric diet designed to reduce the glycemic load and the glycemic index would result in greater sustained weight loss than other hypocaloric diets. Obese subjects (n = 29) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 diets providing 3138 kJ less than estimated energy needs: high glycemic index (HGI), low glycemic index (LGI), or high fat (HF). For the first 12 wk, all food was provided to subjects (feeding phase). Subjects (n = 22) were instructed to follow the assigned diet for 24 additional weeks (free-living phase). Total body weight was obtained and body composition was assessed by skinfold measurements. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA). At 12 wk, weight changes from baseline were significant in all groups but not different among groups (–9.3 ± 1.3 kg for the HGI diet, −9.9 ± 1.4 kg for the LGI diet, and –8.4 ± 1.5 kg for the HF diet). All groups improved in insulin sensitivity at the end of the feeding phase of the study. During the free-living phase, all groups maintained their initial weight loss and their improved insulin sensitivity. Weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity scores were independent of diet composition. In summary, lowering the glycemic load and glycemic index of weight reduction diets does not provide any added benefit to energy restriction in promoting weight loss in obese subjects.

    > Abstract
      Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (24-EE), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body composition were determined in 30 subjects from three groups; control (103 ± 2% ideal body weight, n = 10), moderately obese (129 ± 1% ideal body weight, n = 6), and obese (170 ± 5% ideal body weight, n = 14) individuals. Twenty-four EE was measured in a comfortable airtight respiration chamber. When expressed as absolute values, both RMR and 24-EE were significantly increased in obese subjects when compared to normal weight subjects. The RMR was 7592 ± 351 kJ/day in the obese, 6652 ± 242 kJ/day in the moderately obese, and 6118 ± 405 kJ/day in the controls. Mean 24-EE values were 10043 ± 363, 9599 ± 277, and 8439 ± 432 kJ/day in the obese, moderately obese, and controls, respectively. The larger energy expenditure in the obese over 24 h was mainly due to a greater V̄O2 during the daylight hours. However, 92% of the larger 24-EE in the obese, compared to the control group, was accounted for by the higher RMR and only 8% by other factors such as the increased cost of moving the extra weight of the obese. The higher RMR and 24-EE in the obese was best related to the increased fat free mass.

These data emphasize the necessity to maintain the lean body mass of obese individuals during weight reduction (e.g., by physical exercise) since both RMR and the total energy expenditure over 24 h are closely dependent on the size of the lean body mass.

    head = Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) was assessed using doubly labeled water, resting metabolic rate (RMR) by indirect calorimetry, activity energy expenditure (AEE) by difference and time spent in physical activity by multisensor activity monitors.

    > Objective
      To investigate energy expenditure in lean and obese individuals, focusing particularly on physical activity and severely obese individuals.

    > Design
      Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) was assessed using doubly labeled water, resting metabolic rate (RMR) by indirect calorimetry, activity energy expenditure (AEE) by difference and time spent in physical activity by multisensor activity monitors.

    > Subjects
      In all, 177 lean, Class I and severely obese individuals (age 31–56 years, body mass index 20–64 kg m−2) were analyzed.

    > Results
      All components of energy expenditure were elevated in obese individuals. For example, TDEE was 2404±95 kcal per day in lean and 3244±48 kcal per day in Class III obese individuals. After appropriate adjustment, RMR was similar in all groups. Analysis of AEE by body weight and obesity class indicated a lower AEE in obese individuals. Confirming lower physical activity, obese individuals spent less time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (2.7±1.3, 1.8±0.6, 2.0±1.4 and 1.2±1.0 h per day in lean, Class I, Class II and Class III individuals) and more time in sedentary behaviors.

    > Conclusions
      There was no indication of metabolic efficiency in even the severely obese, as adjusted RMR was similar across all groups. The higher AEE observed in the obese is consistent with a higher cost of activities due to higher body weight. However, the magnitude of the higher AEE (20–25% higher in obese individuals) is lower than expected (weight approximately 100% higher in Class III individuals). Confirming a lower volume of physical activity in the obese, the total time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and average daily metabolic equivalent of task level were lower with increasing obesity. These findings demonstrate that high body weight in obese individuals leads to a high TDEE and AEE, which masks the fact that they are less physically active, which can be influenced by duration or intensity of activity, than in lean individuals.

    head = In this review, we consider these human monogenic obesity syndromes and discuss how far the characterization of these patients has informed our understanding of the physiological role of leptin and the melanocortins in the regulation of human body weight and neuroendocrine function.

    > Abstract
      Considerable attention has focused on deciphering the hypothalamic pathways that mediate the behavioral and metabolic effects of leptin. We and others have identified several single gene defects that disrupt the molecules in the leptin-melanocortin pathway causing severe obesity in humans. In this review, we consider these human monogenic obesity syndromes and discuss how far the characterization of these patients has informed our understanding of the physiological role of leptin and the melanocortins in the regulation of human body weight and neuroendocrine function.

  // Leptin reverses declines in satiation in weight-reduced obese humans
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.012385
  ref 'Kissileff_et_al_01_11_2012
    head = Ten obese humans (4 men, 6 women) were studied as inpatients while they received a weight-maintaining liquid-formula diet. Satiation was studied by measuring intake and ratings of appetite-related dispositions 3 h after ingestion of 300 kcal of the liquid-formula diet.

    > Background
      Individuals who are weight-reduced or leptin deficient have a lower energy expenditure coupled with higher hunger and disinhibition and/or delayed satiation compared with never-weight-reduced control subjects. Because exogenous leptin inhibits feeding in congenitally leptin-deficient humans, reduced leptin signaling may reduce the expression of feeding inhibition in humans.

    > Objective
      The objective was to test the hypothesis that reduced leptin signaling may reduce the expression of feeding inhibition (ie, blunt satiation) in humans by examining the effects of leptin repletion on feeding behavior after weight loss.

    > Design
      Ten obese humans (4 men, 6 women) were studied as inpatients while they received a weight-maintaining liquid-formula diet. Satiation was studied by measuring intake and ratings of appetite-related dispositions 3 h after ingestion of 300 kcal of the liquid-formula diet. The subjects were studied at each of 3 time periods: 1) while they maintained their usual weight (Wtinitial) and then after weight reduction and stabilization at 10% below initial weight and while they received 5 wk of either 2) twice-daily injections of placebo (Wt-10%placebo) or 3) “replacement doses” of leptin (Wt-10%leptin) in a single-blind crossover design with a 2-wk washout period between treatments. Energy expenditure was also measured at each study period.

    > Results
      Both energy expenditure and visual analog scale ratings that reflect satiation were significantly lower at Wt-10% placebo than at Wt initial and Wt-10% leptin.

    > Conclusion
      The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the absence of leptin signaling after weight loss may blunt the expression of feeding inhibition in humans.

    > Abstract
      Increased hunger and food intake during attempts to maintain weight loss are a critical problem in clinical management of obesity. To determine whether reduced body weight maintenance is accompanied by leptin-sensitive changes in neural activity in brain regions affecting regulatory and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, we examined brain region–specific neural activity elicited by food-related visual cues using functional MRI in 6 inpatient obese subjects. Subjects were assessed at their usual weight and, following stabilization at a 10% reduced body weight, while receiving either twice daily subcutaneous injections of leptin or placebo. Following weight loss, there were predictable changes in neural activity, many of which were reversed by leptin, in brain areas known to be involved in the regulatory, emotional, and cognitive control of food intake. Specifically, following weight loss there were leptin-reversible increases in neural activity in response to visual food cues in the brainstem, culmen, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior and middle frontal gyri, middle temporal gyrus, and lingual gyrus. There were also leptin-reversible decreases in activity in response to food cues in the hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus. These data are consistent with a model of the weight-reduced state as one of relative leptin deficiency.

  // Low Dose Leptin Administration Reverses Effects of Sustained Weight-Reduction on Energy Expenditure and Circulating Concentrations of Thyroid Hormones
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.87.5.8628
  ref 'Rosenbaum_et_al_05_01_2002
    head = To determine whether these adaptive metabolic and endocrine changes are partly leptin-mediated, we measured body composition, aspects of energy expenditure, and circulating concentrations of leptin and thyroid hormones in 4 subjects at 3 time points: 1.) Usual body weight; 2.) While stable at 10% reduced body weight; and 3.) During a 5-week period at 10% reduced body weight while receiving twice per day leptin injections that restored 8 AM circulating leptin concentrations to those seen at usual body weight.

    > Abstract
      Maintenance of a reduced body weight is associated with decreased 24-hour energy expenditure, and decreased circulating concentrations of leptin and thyroid hormones. To determine whether these adaptive metabolic and endocrine changes are partly leptin-mediated, we measured body composition, aspects of energy expenditure, and circulating concentrations of leptin and thyroid hormones in 4 subjects at 3 time points: 1.) Usual body weight; 2.) While stable at 10% reduced body weight; and 3.) During a 5-week period at 10% reduced body weight while receiving twice per day leptin injections that restored 8 AM circulating leptin concentrations to those seen at usual body weight. During maintenance of a 10% reduced body weight, circulating T3, T4, and leptin concentrations were decreased. All of these endocrine changes were reversed by administration of “replacement” doses of leptin (r-metHuLeptin). Indirect calorimetry, and subtle changes in body composition associated with leptin administration, were used to calculate the net change in stored calories and in 24-hour energy expenditure. Total energy expenditure increased in all subjects during r-metHuLeptin administration. These data indicate that decrease leptin concentrations resulting from loss of fat mass account for some aspects of the endocrine/metabolic phenotype associated with the weight-reduced state.

  // Changes in Energy Expenditure Resulting from Altered Body Weight
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199503093321001
  ref 'Leibel_et_al_03_09_1995
    head = We repeatedly measured 24-hour total energy expenditure, resting and nonresting energy expenditure, and the thermic effect of feeding in 18 obese subjects and 23 subjects who had never been obese. The subjects were studied at their usual body weight and after losing 10 to 20 percent of their body weight by underfeeding or gaining 10 percent by overfeeding.

    > BACKGROUND
      No current treatment for obesity reliably sustains weight loss, perhaps because compensatory metabolic processes resist the maintenance of the altered body weight. We examined the effects of experimental perturbations of body weight on energy expenditure to determine whether they lead to metabolic changes and whether obese subjects and those who have never been obese respond similarly.

    > METHODS
      We repeatedly measured 24-hour total energy expenditure, resting and nonresting energy expenditure, and the thermic effect of feeding in 18 obese subjects and 23 subjects who had never been obese. The subjects were studied at their usual body weight and after losing 10 to 20 percent of their body weight by underfeeding or gaining 10 percent by overfeeding.

    > RESULTS
      Maintenance of a body weight at a level 10 percent or more below the initial weight was associated with a mean (±SD) reduction in total energy expenditure of 6±3 kcal per kilogram of fat-free mass per day in the subjects who had never been obese (P<0.001) and 8±5 kcal per kilogram per day in the obese subjects (P<0.001). Resting energy expenditure and nonresting energy expenditure each decreased 3 to 4 kcal per kilogram of fat-free mass per day in both groups of subjects. Maintenance of body weight at a level 10 percent above the usual weight was associated with an increase in total energy expenditure of 9±7 kcal per kilogram of fat-free mass per day in the subjects who had never been obese (P<0.001) and 8±4 kcal per kilogram per day in the obese subjects (P<0.001). The thermic effect of feeding and nonresting energy expenditure increased by approximately 1 to 2 and 8 to 9 kcal per kilogram of fat-free mass per day, respectively, after weight gain. These changes in energy expenditure were not related to the degree of adiposity or the sex of the subjects.

    > CONCLUSIONS
      Maintenance of a reduced or elevated body weight is associated with compensatory changes in energy expenditure, which oppose the maintenance of a body weight that is different from the usual weight. These compensatory changes may account for the poor long-term efficacy of treatments for obesity.

  // Energy intake in weight-reduced humans.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.05.062
  ref 'Rosenbaum_et_al_09_02_2010
    head = We discuss briefly the evidence indicating that the maintenance of a reduced body weight results in what could be termed “adaptive energy intake” that is leptin-sensitive.

    > Abstract
      Almost anyone who has ever lost weight can attest that it is harder to sustain weight loss than to lose weight. Maintenance of a 10% or greater reduced body weight is accompanied by decreases in energy expenditure to levels significantly below what is predicted solely on the basis of weight and body composition changes. This disproportionate decline in energy expenditure would not be sufficient to account for the over 80% recidivism rate to pre-weight loss levels of body fatness after otherwise successful weight reduction if there were a corresponding reduction in energy intake. In fact, reduced body weight maintenance is accompanied by increased energy intake above that required to maintain reduced weight. The failure to reduce energy intake in response to decreased energy output reflects decreased satiation and perception of how much food is eaten and multiple changes in neuronal signaling in response to food which conspire with the decline in energy output to keep body energy stores (fat) above a CNS-defined minimum (threshold). Much of this biological opposition to sustained weight loss is mediated by the adipocyte-derived hormone “leptin.”

The physiological responses to maintenance of a reduced body weight should be regarded as important targets for “weight maintenance” as opposed to “weight loss” pharmacotherapy. The relevant molecules and their effective concentrations may be quite different for each of these two highly desirable therapeutic goals.

  // Genetic identification of a neural circuit that suppresses appetite
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12596
  ref 'Carter_et_al_10_13_2013
    head = We identify calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing neurons in the outer external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus that project to the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala as forming a functionally important circuit for suppressing appetite.

    > Abstract
      Appetite suppression occurs after a meal and in conditions when it is unfavourable to eat, such as during illness or exposure to toxins. A brain region proposed to play a role in appetite suppression is the parabrachial nucleus, a heterogeneous population of neurons surrounding the superior cerebellar peduncle in the brainstem. The parabrachial nucleus is thought to mediate the suppression of appetite induced by the anorectic hormones amylin and cholecystokinin2, as well as by lithium chloride and lipopolysaccharide, compounds that mimic the effects of toxic foods and bacterial infections, respectively. Hyperactivity of the parabrachial nucleus is also thought to cause starvation after ablation of orexigenic agouti-related peptide neurons in adult mice. However, the identities of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that regulate feeding are unknown, as are the functionally relevant downstream projections. Here we identify calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing neurons in the outer external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus that project to the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala as forming a functionally important circuit for suppressing appetite. Using genetically encoded anatomical, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools, we demonstrate that activation of these neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses appetite. In contrast, inhibition of these neurons increases food intake in circumstances when mice do not normally eat and prevents starvation in adult mice whose agouti-related peptide neurons are ablated. Taken together, our data demonstrate that this neural circuit from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of the amygdala mediates appetite suppression in conditions when it is unfavourable to eat. This neural circuit may provide targets for therapeutic intervention to overcome or promote appetite.

  ref 'Aponte_et_al_01_05_2011
    head = We explored the causal relationship between cell type–specific neuron activation and feeding behavior for AGRP and POMC neurons in the hypothalamic ARC

    > Abstract
      Two intermingled hypothalamic neuron populations specified by expression of agouti-related peptide (AGRP) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) positively and negatively influence feeding behavior, respectively, possibly by reciprocally regulating downstream melanocortin receptors. However, the sufficiency of these neurons to control behavior and the relationship of their activity to the magnitude and dynamics of feeding are unknown. To measure this, we used channelrhodopsin-2 for cell type–specific photostimulation. Activation of only 800 AGRP neurons in mice evoked voracious feeding within minutes. The behavioral response increased with photoexcitable neuron number, photostimulation frequency and stimulus duration. Conversely, POMC neuron stimulation reduced food intake and body weight, which required melanocortin receptor signaling. However, AGRP neuron–mediated feeding was not dependent on suppressing this melanocortin pathway, indicating that AGRP neurons directly engage feeding circuits. Furthermore, feeding was evoked selectively over drinking without training or prior photostimulus exposure, which suggests that AGRP neurons serve a dedicated role coordinating this complex behavior.

  // Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for height and body mass index in ∼700000 individuals of European ancestry
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddy271
  ref 'Yengo_et_al_06_30_2018
    head = We have presented here the results of the meta-analysis of a single large study, the UKB, with previously published GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry.

    > Abstract
      Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of height and body mass index (BMI) in ∼250000 European participants have led to the discovery of ∼700 and ∼100 nearly independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P < 1 × 10−8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6% of the variance of height and ∼6.0% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.

  ref 'Yeo_et_al_09_25_2012
    head = Recent progress into the etiology of common obesity has been made with genome-wide association studies.

    > Abstract
      Over the past 20 years, genetic studies have illuminated critical pathways in the hypothalamus and brainstem mediating energy homeostasis, such as the melanocortin, leptin, 5-hydroxytryptamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling axes. The identification of these pathways necessary for appropriate appetitive responses to energy state has yielded insight into normal homeostatic processes. Although monogenic alterations in each of these axes result in severe obesity, such cases remain rare. The major burden of disease is carried by those with common obesity, which has so far resisted yielding meaningful biological insights. Recent progress into the etiology of common obesity has been made with genome-wide association studies. Such studies now reveal more than 32 different candidate obesity genes, most of which are highly expressed or known to act in the CNS, emphasizing, as in rare monogenic forms of obesity, the role of the brain in predisposition to obesity.

  // A Randomized, Controlled Trial of 3.0 mg of Liraglutide in Weight Management
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1411892
  ref 'Sunyer_et_al_06_02_2015
    head = We conducted a 56-week, double-blind trial involving 3731 patients who did not have type 2 diabetes and who had a body-mass index of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 if they had treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension. We randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (2487 patients) or placebo (1244 patients);

    > Background
      Obesity is a chronic disease with serious health consequences, but weight loss is difficult to maintain through lifestyle intervention alone. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to have potential benefit for weight management at a once-daily dose of 3.0 mg, injected subcutaneously.

    > Methods
      We conducted a 56-week, double-blind trial involving 3731 patients who did not have type 2 diabetes and who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 if they had treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension. We randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (2487 patients) or placebo (1244 patients); both groups received counseling on lifestyle modification. The coprimary end points were the change in body weight and the proportions of patients losing at least 5% and more than 10% of their initial body weight.

    > Results
      At baseline, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 45.1±12.0 years, the mean weight was 106.2±21.4 kg, and the mean BMI was 38.3±6.4; a total of 78.5% of the patients were women and 61.2% had prediabetes. At week 56, patients in the liraglutide group had lost a mean of 8.4±7.3 kg of body weight, and those in the placebo group had lost a mean of 2.8±6.5 kg (a difference of −5.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, −6.0 to −5.1; P<0.001, with last-observation-carried-forward imputation). A total of 63.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group as compared with 27.1% in the placebo group lost at least 5% of their body weight (P<0.001), and 33.1% and 10.6%, respectively, lost more than 10% of their body weight (P<0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events with liraglutide were mild or moderate nausea and diarrhea. Serious events occurred in 6.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group and in 5.0% of the patients in the placebo group.

    > Conclusions
      In this study, 3.0 mg of liraglutide, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, was associated with reduced body weight and improved metabolic control. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes NN8022-1839 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01272219. opens in new tab.)

  // Regulation of Food Intake, Energy Balance, and Body Fat Mass: Implications for the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Obesity
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2011-2525
  ref 'Guyenet_et_al_03_01_2012
    head = We considered all relevant published research and cited references that represented the highest quality evidence available.

    > Context
      Obesity has emerged as one of the leading medical challenges of the 21st century. The resistance of this disorder to effective, long-term treatment can be traced to the fact that body fat stores are subject to homeostatic regulation in obese individuals, just as in lean individuals. Because the growing obesity epidemic is linked to a substantial increase in daily energy intake, a key priority is to delineate how mechanisms governing food intake and body fat content are altered in an obesogenic environment.

    > Evidence Acquisition
      We considered all relevant published research and cited references that represented the highest quality evidence available. Where space permitted, primary references were cited.

    > Evidence Synthesis
      The increase of energy intake that has fueled the U.S. obesity epidemic is linked to greater availability of highly rewarding/palatable and energy-dense food. Obesity occurs in genetically susceptible individuals and involves the biological defense of an elevated body fat mass, which may result in part from interactions between brain reward and homeostatic circuits. Inflammatory signaling, accumulation of lipid metabolites, or other mechanisms that impair hypothalamic neurons may also contribute to the development of obesity and offer a plausible mechanism to explain the biological defense of elevated body fat mass.

    > Conclusions
      Despite steady research progress, mechanisms underlying the resistance to fat loss once obesity is established remain incompletely understood. Breakthroughs in this area may be required for the development of effective new obesity prevention and treatment strategies.

    quote !b = If obesity involves the biological defense of an elevated level of body fat, as current evidence suggests, advice to simply “eat less, move more” cannot be expected to remedy the problem. This is because interventions that reduce body fat stores without a corresponding decrease in the defended level of fat mass elicit compensatory responses that promote the recovery of lost fat and are difficult to consciously override. Because these responses constitute perhaps the single largest obstacle to effective obesity treatment, breakthroughs in understanding the biological defense of elevated body fat mass may be required to enable the development of effective new obesity prevention and treatment strategies.

    / March, 2012 - The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism
    quote !c = Findings collectively suggest that obesity can arise when animals or humans are confronted with foods whose palatability/reward value greatly exceeds that to which they are genetically adapted, and hence that interventions that inhibit food reward can prevent fat gain and promote fat loss. In considering these hypotheses, it is important to bear in mind that obesity in both humans and animal models involves the biological defense of an elevated level of body fat mass. A key issue, therefore, is to understand how a change in the reward value of a diet impacts the energy homeostasis system.


  // Effect of Macronutrient Composition on Short-Term Food Intake and Weight Loss
  doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.114.006957
  ref 'Bellissimo_et_al_05_07_2015
    head = This review explores the effect of macronutrient composition on short-term FI and then examines the effect of longer-term clinical trials of varying dietary macronutrient composition on weight loss.

    > Abstract
      The purpose of this review is to describe the role of macronutrient composition on the suppression of short-term food intake (FI) and weight loss. The effects of macronutrient composition on short-term FI will be reviewed first, followed by a brief examination of longer-term clinical trials that vary in effects of dietary macronutrient composition on weight loss. The objectives were: 1) to examine the effect of macronutrient composition on the suppression of short-term FI, 2) to determine whether some macronutrient sources suppress FI beyond their provision of energy, 3) to assess the combined effects of macronutrients on FI and glycemic response, and 4) to determine whether knowledge of the effect of macronutrients on short-term FI has led to greater success in spontaneous weight loss, adherence to energy-restricted diets, and better weight maintenance after weight loss. Although knowledge of macronutrient composition on short-term FI regulation has advanced our understanding of the role of diet composition on energy balance, it has yet to lead to greater success in long-term weight loss and weight maintenance. It is clear from this review that many approaches based on manipulating dietary macronutrient composition can help people lose weight as long as they follow the diets. However, only by evaluating the interaction between the physiologic systems that govern FI and body weight may the benefits of dietary macronutrient composition be fully realized. © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

Protein exerts a sustained effect on insulin, GLP-1, and PYY (44), and all macronutrient sources contribute to a decrease in postprandial ghrelin concentrations.

    head = We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative samples of 538,140 women aged 15–49 y drawn from 54 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008.

    > Background
      The increasing trend in body mass index (BMI) and overweight in rapidly developing economies is well recognized.

    > Objective
      We assessed the association between socioeconomic status and BMI and overweight in low- to middle-income countries.

    > Design
      We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative samples of 538,140 women aged 15–49 y drawn from 54 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008. BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height squared in meters, was specified as the outcome, and a BMI (in kg/m2) of ≥25 was additionally specified to model the likelihood of being overweight. Household wealth and education were included as markers of individual socioeconomic status, and per capita Gross Domestic Product (pcGDP) was included as a marker of country-level economic development.

    > Results
      Globally, a one-quartile increase in wealth was associated with a 0.54 increase in BMI (95% CI: 0.50, 0.64) and a 33% increase in overweight (95% CI: 26%, 41%) in adjusted models. Although the strength of this association varied across countries, the association between wealth and BMI and overweight was positive in 96% (52 of 54) of the countries. Similar patterns were observed in urban and rural areas, although SES gradients tended to be greater in urban areas. There was a positive association between pcGDP and BMI or overweight, with only weak evidence of an interaction between pcGDP and wealth.

    > Conclusion
      Higher BMI and overweight remain concentrated in higher socioeconomic groups, even though increasing BMI and overweight prevalence are important global public concerns.

  ref 'Schwartz_et_al_06_26_2017
    head = We included evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological literature to assess current knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying excess body-fat accumulation, the biological defense of excess fat mass, and the tendency for lost weight to be regained.

    > Abstract
      Obesity is among the most common and costly chronic disorders worldwide. Estimates suggest that in the United States obesity affects one-third of adults, accounts for up to one-third of total mortality, is concentrated among lower income groups, and increasingly affects children as well as adults. A lack of effective options for long-term weight reduction magnifies the enormity of this problem; individuals who successfully complete behavioral and dietary weight-loss programs eventually regain most of the lost weight. We included evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological literature to assess current knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying excess body-fat accumulation, the biological defense of excess fat mass, and the tendency for lost weight to be regained. A major area of emphasis is the science of energy homeostasis, the biological process that maintains weight stability by actively matching energy intake to energy expenditure over time. Growing evidence suggests that obesity is a disorder of the energy homeostasis system, rather than simply arising from the passive accumulation of excess weight. We need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this “upward setting” or “resetting” of the defended level of body-fat mass, whether inherited or acquired. The ongoing study of how genetic, developmental, and environmental forces affect the energy homeostasis system will help us better understand these mechanisms and are therefore a major focus of this statement. The scientific goal is to elucidate obesity pathogenesis so as to better inform treatment, public policy, advocacy, and awareness of obesity in ways that ultimately diminish its public health and economic consequences.

The effects of diet composition per se on metabolic variables suggested to contribute to obesity pathogenesis (e.g., those related to plasma levels of glucose, insulin, or free fatty acids; inherent differences in the propensity of adipocytes to store fat; or the gut microbiome) do not play a clinically significant causal role unless they promote increased calorie intake.

  ref 'Krashes_et_al_03_01_2011
    head = Using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) technology to provide specific and reversible regulation of neuronal activity in mice, we have demonstrated that acute activation of AgRP neurons rapidly and dramatically induces feeding, reduces energy expenditure, and ultimately increases fat stores. we used a Cre-recombinase–dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to target hM3Dq to AgRP neurons

    > Abstract
      Several different neuronal populations are involved in regulating energy homeostasis. Among these, agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons are thought to promote feeding and weight gain; however, the evidence supporting this view is incomplete. Using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) technology to provide specific and reversible regulation of neuronal activity in mice, we have demonstrated that acute activation of AgRP neurons rapidly and dramatically induces feeding, reduces energy expenditure, and ultimately increases fat stores. All these effects returned to baseline after stimulation was withdrawn. In contrast, inhibiting AgRP neuronal activity in hungry mice reduced food intake. Together, these findings demonstrate that AgRP neuron activity is both necessary and sufficient for feeding. Of interest, activating AgRP neurons potently increased motivation for feeding and also drove intense food-seeking behavior, demonstrating that AgRP neurons engage brain sites controlling multiple levels of feeding behavior. Due to its ease of use and suitability for both acute and chronic regulation, DREADD technology is ideally suited for investigating the neural circuits hypothesized to regulate energy balance

  // Adiposity and diabetes mellitus in a monkey with hypothalamic lesions.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-23-2-175
  ref 'Ranson_et_al_08_01_1938
    head = An account is given of a monkey which developed adiposity within 3 weeks after lesions had been placed in the hypothalamus.

    > Abstract
      In nearly 50 monkeys and in over 300 cats lesions have been placed in the hypothalamus, and in only one animal, a monkey, has a definitely pathological adiposity been observed. In this monkey the adiposity was associated with diabetes mellitus and a moderate disturbance in the capacity to regulate body temperature. Several of the cats which developed diabetes insipidus also became obese, but not more so than control cats kept in small cages and given a generous diet.

    quote !c = The lesions in the hypothalamus and the histology of the hypophysis, suprarenal glands and thyroid were studied without yielding clear evidence concerning the cause of the adiposity.

    quote !d = About 3 weeks after the operation it was noted that the monkey had become quite fat and had developed a voracious appetite. Two months after operation the weight had more than doubled and, 6 months after, more than tripled. After this the rate of gain was much slower. This rapid increase in weight was associated with a marked polyphagia. The monkey was observed to eat constantly and showed great greediness. The adiposity was largely confined to the neck and trunk, the abdomen showing a tremendous protrusion.

    quote !a = The present study appears to show that both increased food intake (hyperphagia) and decreased food intake or even complete cessation of eating can be produced as a result of certain bilateral hypothalamic lesions.

    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !b = A small, well localized area has been found in the lateral hypothalamus; the bilateral destruction of this area is followed by a complete absence of spontaneous eating. This area has been tentatively designated as a "feeding center."


    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !c = A small area has been localized in rats in the extreme lateral part of the lateral hypothalamus, in the rostro-caudal plane corresponding to the central part of the ventromedial nucleus. Bilateral destruction of this area leads to a complete cessation of eating.

    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !d = A unilateral lesion has no such effect. Bilateral lesions involving either the ventromedial nuclei, or the region between them and the lateral area (but not involving the lateral area), produce hyperphagia and obesity.

    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !e = Since lesions which have been confined to the lateral hypothalamus without direct injury to these other structures have completely inhibited eating, while lesions which destroyed the adjoining structures at the same time sparing at least one lateral hypothalamic area have not abolished eating, it can be inferred that this effect is probably due solely to lesions in the lateral hypothalamus. The behavior of these rats and cats suggests that the lesions have in some manner removed what Adolph has called the "urge to eat.

    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !f = Bilateral lesions in other areas of the hypothalamus do not produce a change in food intake, with the exception that injury to regions adjacent to the lateral area may induce diminished eating for a few days after operation.

    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !g = If the animal is made obese by medial lesions, eating ceases when the lateral areas are destroyed bilaterally. This lateral area has been called a "feeding center"; it may be responsible for the central hunger reaction or the urge to eat, while the ventromedial nucleus or some structure in its neighborhood may be capable of exerting an inhibitory control over the "feeding center" through fibers which run laterally into the lateral hypothalamic area. Similar observations have been made in cats


    # / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    # quote !a = The region the bilateral destruction of which produces hyperphagia and obesity, includes some parts of the ventromedial nuclei or the adjacent areas of the lateral hypothalamus. Lesions more rostral or dorsal which completely spare these nuclei do not lead to hyperphagia and obesity. Authors have also reported that these nuclei need not be completely destroyed to produce obesity.


    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !h = The results of our study with well localized, small lesions generally confirm their observations, although we have found that bilateral lesions placed lateral to those nuclei, and completely sparing the nuclei themselves, also bring about obesity.

    # / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    # quote !a = We have not been able to obtain similar results in rats from small caudal lesions in the particular horizontal plane which we have chosen. Of six animals in which caudal lesions were made, only two (rats 106 and 101) showed slight increases of food intake, and sections from the brain of these two revealed lesions extending rostrally up to the caudal limits of the ventromedial nuclei.


    / October, 1951 - Yale J Biol Med.
    quote !i = The more medial hypothalamic structures (where lesions cause hyperphagia) exert their influence on food intake through the "feeding center," possibly by means of inhibitory fibers running laterally into that center. Thus, an animal fails to eat following destruction of the "feeding centers" of both sides, while if the "feeding centers" (or even one of them) are intact and the more medial mechanism is removed by destruction of the ventromedial nuclei or their efferent fibers, the animal exhibits a state of hyperphagia. This concept is also in accord with the observation that the degree of hyperphagia and the rapidity with which obesity develops depend upon the size of the lesions in the more medial region, in other words, upon the number of inhibitory fibers damaged. On the other hand, combined bilateral lesions of the medial and lateral mechanisms, together, produce the same effect as lateral lesions alone, that is, failure to eat.
