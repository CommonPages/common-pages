  // Intraventricular insulin reduces food intake and body weight of lean but not obese Zucker rats

    head = Porcine insulin (2 mU/rat/day) and its saline vehicle were infused into the third cerebral ventricle of female lean or obese Zucker rats using 14-day osmotic minipumps.

    > Abstract
      Porcine insulin (2 mU/rat/day) and its saline vehicle were infused into the third cerebral ventricle of female lean or obese Zucker rats using 14-day osmotic minipumps. Lean rats receiving saline (N = 6) gained 14±3 g over the 14 days, whereas lean rats receiving insulin (N = 7) lost 12±4 g over the same interval (p < 0·01). The average total food intake of the insulin-infused group was decreased by 14% (p < 0·05) as compared with that of the saline-infused group. The decreased caloric consumption was adequate to account for the body weight loss. Insulin infusion had no effect on food intake or body weight of the obese rats relative to their saline-infused controls (change in body weight: saline (N = 5), −14±23 g; insulin (N = 7), +3±14 g). These results suggest that genetically obese Zucker rats have reduced sensitivity to insulin in the central nervous system. We propose that this phenomenon may participate in the development and maintenance of hyperphagia and obesity in these animals.

    > Abstract
      This article describes the close relationship among the hormone insulin, the central nervous system, and the regulation of food intake and body adiposity. The initial section documents the control of insulin output from the pancreas by the central nervous system, and a later section describes the relationship of insulin levels in the blood to the degree of adiposity. Another section documents the ability of insulin to gain access to the brain and to elicit responses there. Finally, the behavioral effects of insulin added to the brain, and especially its ability to reduce food intake and body weight, is discussed. The implications to obesity are stressed throughout.

  // Recombinant leptin for weight loss in obese and lean adults: a randomized, controlled, dose-escalation trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.282.16.1568
  ref 'Heymsfield_et_al_10_27_1999
    head = A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, escalating dose cohort trial conducted from April 1997 to October 1998 on Fifty-four lean and 73 obese predominantly white men (n = 67) and women (n = 60) with mean (SD) age of 39 (10.3) years.

    > Context
      The protein hormone leptin is important to the homeostatic regulation of body weight. Treatment with exogenous leptin may affect weight loss.

    > Objective
      To determine the relationship between increasing doses of exogenous leptin administration and weight loss in both lean and obese adults.

    > Design
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, escalating dose cohort trial conducted from April 1997 to October 1998.

    > Setting
      Four university nutrition and obesity clinics and 2 contract clinical research clinics.

    > Participants
      Fifty-four lean (body mass index, 20.0-27.5 kg/m2; mean [SD] body weight, 72.0 [9.7] kg) and 73 obese (body mass index, 27.6-36.0 kg/m2; mean [SD] body weight, 89.8 [11.4] kg) predominantly white (80%) men (n = 67) and women (n = 60) with mean (SD) age of 39 (10.3) years.

    > Interventions
      Recombinant methionyl human leptin self-administered by daily morning subcutaneous injection (0 [placebo], 0.01, 0.03, 0.10, or 0.30 mg/kg). In part A, lean and obese subjects were treated for 4 weeks; in part B, obese subjects were treated for an additional 20 weeks. Lean subjects consumed a eucaloric diet to maintain body weight at the current value, and obese subjects were prescribed a diet that reduced their daily energy intake by 2100 kJ/d (500-kcal/d) from the amount needed to maintain a stable weight.

    >
      Main Outcome Measures Body weight, body fat, and incidence of adverse events.

    > Results
      Weight loss from baseline increased with increasing dose of leptin among all subjects at 4 weeks (P = .02) and among obese subjects at 24 weeks (P = .01) of treatment. Mean (SD) weight changes at 4 weeks ranged from −0.4 (2.0) kg for placebo (n = 36) to −1.9 kg (1.6) kg for the 0.1 mg/kg dose (n = 29). Mean (SD) weight changes at 24 weeks ranged from −0.7 (5.4) kg for the 0.01 mg/kg dose (n = 6) to –7.1 (8.5) kg for the 0.30 mg/kg dose (n = 8). Fat mass declined from baseline as dose increased among all subjects at 4 weeks (P = .002) and among obese subjects at 24 weeks of treatment (P = .004); more than 95% of weight loss was fat loss in the 2 highest dose cohorts at 24 weeks. Baseline serum leptin concentrations were not related to weight loss at week 4 (P = .88) or at week 24 (P = .76). No clinically significant adverse effects were observed on major organ systems. Mild-to-moderate reactions at the injection site were the most commonly reported adverse effects.

    > Conclusions
      A dose-response relationship with weight and fat loss was observed with subcutaneous recombinant leptin injections in both lean and obese subjects. Based on this study, administration of exogenous leptin appears to induce weight loss in some obese subjects with elevated endogenous serum leptin concentrations. Additional research into the potential role for leptin and related hormones in the treatment of human obesity is warranted.

    head = The aim of this study is to examine if defects (extreme overexpression in mice which lack bioactive ob-protein, have nonfunctional ob-receptors or hypothalamic lesions, and undetectable expression in mice), corresponding to those in mice, exist in human obesity. Adipose tissue was obtained from 94 adult obese subjects and from six children who had developed obesity after surgery in the hypothalamic region

    > Abstract
      Our knowledge of the role of the recently cloned ob-protein (leptin) in the regulation of body fat stores is largely derived from experiments performed in mice. Different mouse models exhibit abnormalities in ob-gene expression, with extreme overexpression in mice which lack bioactive ob-protein, have nonfunctional ob-receptors or hypothalamic lesions, and undetectable expression in mice with suggested defects in regulatory elements. The aim of this study is to examine if defects, corresponding to those in mice, exist in human obesity. Adipose tissue was obtained from 94 adult obese subjects and from six children who had developed obesity after surgery in the hypothalamic region. Total RNA was isolated and ob-gene expression was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot. The coding region of the ob-gene was sequenced in both directions in the 94 obese adults. No mutations were detected in the coding region of the ob-gene and ob-gene expression was detectable in all subjects and none of the subjects had an extreme overexpression. There was no systematic increase in ob-expression in obese children with hypothalamic disease compared to their healthy brothers and sisters. These results show that severe abnormalities involving the ob-gene, analogous to those described in mouse models, are rare in human obesity. We therefore conclude that the cloning and subsequent analysis of the ob-gene has not provided information that can, by itself, explain the genetic component in the development of human obesity.

    > Abstract
      This review critically reappraises recent scientific evidence concerning central leptin insufficiency versus leptin resistance formulations to explain metabolic and neural disorders resulting from subnormal or defective leptin signaling in various sites in the brain. Research at various fronts to unravel the complexities of the neurobiology of leptin is surveyed to provide a comprehensive account of the neural and metabolic effects of environmentally imposed fluctuations in leptin availability at brain sites and the outcome of newer technology to restore leptin signaling in a site-specific manner. The cumulative new knowledge favors a unified central leptin insufficiency syndrome over the, in vogue, central resistance hypothesis to explain the global adverse impact of deficient leptin signaling in the brain. Furthermore, the leptin insufficiency syndrome delineates a novel role of leptin in the hypothalamus in restraining rhythmic pancreatic insulin secretion while concomitantly enhancing glucose metabolism and non-shivering thermogenic energy expenditure, sequelae that would otherwise promote fat accrual to store excess energy resulting from consumption of energy-enriched diets. A concerted effort should now focus on development of newer technologies for delivery of leptin or leptin mimetics to specifically target neural pathways for remediation of diverse ailments encompassing the central leptin insufficiency syndrome.

    quote !b = The results of the directionally opposite relationships of weight to the height and age at menarche are to obscure the latter, unless the height covariance is accounted for. By merely comparing mean weights at menarche of various age groups, Frisch and Revelle have been led to conclude that the weight is constant over age. The more detailed analysis of our data in contrast reveals that the two are related and that the "critical weight" hypothesis is an artifact arising from failure to consider the interrelationships of all three variables.

    head = Body weight, food intake, and age at vaginal opening and estrus were studied for two groups of weanling rats (age 21 days), fed on high-fat (24.6% by weight) and low-fat (5.0%) diets.

    > Abstract
      Body weight, food intake, and age at vaginal opening and estrus were studied for two groups of weanling rats (age 21 days), fed on high-fat (24.6% by weight) and low-fat (5.0%) diets. Fat was substituted isocalorically for carbohydrate in the high-fat diet. The high-fat rats had estrus at 33.3 +/- 0.8 days, significantly earlier (P less than 0.001) than the age at estrus, 37.4 +/- 0.7 days, of the low-fat rats. Estrus was simultaneous with vaginal opening in 81% of the high-fat rats, in comparison to 48% of the low-fat rats. The caloric intake per 100 g of body weight of the high-fat and low-fat rats did not differ at vaginal opening or at estrus, whereas the two groups differed significantly at both events in age, body weight, absolute food intake (g/day), and relative food intake (g/100 g of body weight per day) and absolute caloric intake (calories/day). Caloric intake/100 g of body weight as a function of chronological age first increased and then decreased steadily before estrus for both high-fat and low-fat rats. The findings support Kennedy's hypothesis that a food intake signal, now further defined as caloric intake/100 g of body weight, is a signal for puberty, and are in accord with the hypothesis that a critical body composition of fatness is essential for estrus in the rat, as in the human female.

  ref 'Frisch_et_al_05_15_1980
    head = Evidence is presented that a particular ratio of fat to lean mass is normally necessary for puberty and the maintenance of female reproductive ability in the human and rat. The synchronizing signals may be metabolic, relating food intake to core temperature and fat depots.


    > Abtract
      The high percentage of fat (about 26-28%) in the mature human female may influence reproductive ability directly: 1) as an extragonadal source of estrogen; and 2) by influencing the direction of metabolism of estrogen to the most potent or least potent forms. The slow maturation of the hypothalamus and pituitary up to menarche, or first estrus, is accompanied by a slow maturation of the body, which changes not only in size but in the relative proportion of bone, muscle, and fat. Evidence is presented that a particular ratio of fat to lean mass is normally necessary for puberty and the maintenance of female reproductive ability in the human and rat. The synchronizing signals may be metabolic, relating food intake to core temperature and fat depots.

    head = We report a simple method of estimating a minimal weight for height necessary for the onset of menstrual cycles (menarche) in primary amenorrhea and for the restoration of menstrual cycles in cases of secondary amenorrhea when the amenorrhea is due to undernourishment.

    > Abstract
      Weight loss causes loss of menstrual function (amenorrhea) and weight gain restores menstrual cycles. A minimal weight for height necessary for the onset of or the restoration of menstrual cycles in cases of primary or secondary amenorrhea due to undernutrition is indicated by an index of fatness of normal girls at menarche and at age 18 years, respectively. Amenorrheic patients of ages 16 years and over resume menstrual cycles after weight gain at a heavier weight for a particular height than is found at menarche. Girls become relatively and absolutely fatter from menarche to age 18 years. The data suggest that a minimum level of stored, easily mobilized energy is necessary for ovulation and menstrual cycles in the human female.

  // A Longitudinal Assessment of Hormonal and Physical Alterations during Normal Puberty in Boys. V. Rising Leptin Levels May Signal the Onset of Puberty
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.82.4.3878
  ref 'Mantzoros_et_al_04_01_1997
    head = We examined whether changes in circulating leptin levels could represent the hormonal signal responsible for triggering the onset of puberty in humans. Eight prepubertal boys (Tanner genital stage 1 or early stage 2 at the initiation of the study) were evaluated longitudinally for 2.5–5.1 yr depending on when Tanner stage 5 of genital development was achieved.


    > Abstract
      Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is an adipocyte-derived hormone that signals the amount of adipose tissue energy stores to the brain and exerts major effects on energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine function. Leptin has recently been shown to affect reproductive function in leptin-deficient and normal rodents. As puberty, the process of sexual maturation and acquisition of reproductive competence, has been proposed to be triggered by the attainment of a critical amount and/or distribution of fat, we examined whether changes in circulating leptin levels could represent the hormonal signal responsible for triggering the onset of puberty in humans. Eight prepubertal boys (Tanner genital stage 1 or early stage 2 at the initiation of the study) were evaluated longitudinally for 2.5–5.1 yr depending on when Tanner stage 5 of genital development was achieved. Sera for the determination of leptin, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were obtained every 4 months during the period of the study. Compared to baseline prepubertal levels (8 months before the onset of puberty, as defined by the initial rise in testosterone above the detection limit of the assay), leptin levels rose by approximately 50% just before the onset of puberty and decreased to approximately baseline values after the initiation of puberty (P < 0.01, by ANOVA), remaining stable for more than 2 yr. These changes occurred despite constantly increasing body mass index (P < 0.05, by ANOVA). No significant association between leptin and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations was detected. In conclusion, the levels of circulating leptin are consistent with the hypothesis that this molecule is an important signal responsible for triggering the onset of puberty. The stimulus for a surge in leptin levels just before the onset of puberty is currently unknown.

    head = We studied the effects of once daily injections of recombinant leptin on the onset of puberty in female mice weaned on day 21 and fed ad libitum.

    > Abstract
      The fat-derived hormone, leptin, is proposed to serve as an adipostatic signal to the brain to reduce food intake and body weight. In addition to its effects on body weight, chronic leptin treatment restores puberty and fertility to ob/ob mice with total leptin deficiency, and acute treatment substantially corrects hypogonadism in mice starved for 2 d without affecting body weight. Leptin may therefore be a critical signal, linking adiposity and reproduction. Since body weight and adiposity appear to play a critical role in the timing of puberty in humans and rodents, and leptin levels rise with increasing adiposity, we studied the effects of once daily injections of recombinant leptin on the onset of puberty in female mice weaned on day 21 and fed ad libitum. There was a linear increase in body weight during the study period, which was not altered by the dose of leptin used. Mice injected with leptin had an earlier onset of three classic pubertal parameters (i.e., vaginal opening, estrus, and cycling) compared with saline-injected controls. Leptin is the first peripheral molecule demonstrated to accelerate the maturation of the reproductive axis in normal rodents. We propose that leptin is the signal that informs the brain that energy stores are sufficient to support the high energy demands of reproduction, and may be a major determinant of the timing of puberty.

    > Abstract
      Numerous studies have revealed an association between nutritional status, adiposity, and reproductive maturity. The role of leptin, a hormone secreted from adipose tissue, in the onset of reproductive function was investigated. Normal prepubertal female mice injected with leptin grew at a slower rate than controls as a result of the hormone's thinning effects, but they reproduced up to 9 days earlier than controls and showed earlier maturation of the reproductive tract. These results suggest that leptin acts as a signal triggering puberty, thus supporting the hypothesis that fat accumulation enhances maturation of the reproductive tract.

  // A mutation in the human leptin receptor gene causes obesity and pituitary dysfunction

    head = We studied a family (HD) with a strong prevalence of morbid obesity occurring early in life. We have described a homozygous mutation in the human leptin receptor and have analysed the clinical and biological data available for the affected patients

    > Abstract
      The adipocyte-specific hormone leptin, the product of the obese (ob) gene,regulates adipose-tissue mass through hypothalamic effects on satiety and energy expenditure1. Leptin acts through the leptin receptor, a single-transmembrane-domain receptor of the cytokine-receptor family. In rodents, homozygous mutations ingenes encoding leptin1 or the leptin receptor6 cause early-onsetmorbid obesity, hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. These rodents also show hypercortisolaemia, alterations in glucose homeostasis, dyslipidaemia, and infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadisms. In humans, leptin deficiency due to a mutation in the leptin gene is associated with early-onset obesity. Here we describe a homozygous mutation in the human leptin receptor gene that results in a truncated leptin receptor lacking both the transmembrane and the intracellular domains. In addition to their early-onset morbid obesity, patients homozygous for this mutation have no pubertal development and their secretion of growth hormone and thyrotropin is reduced. These results indicate that leptin is an important physiological regulator of several endocrine functions in humans.

      The extreme obesity of the obese (ob/ob) mouse is attributable to mutations in the gene encoding leptin1, an adipocyte-specific secreted protein which has profound effects on appetite and energy expenditure. We know of no equivalent evidence regarding leptin's role in the control of fat mass in humans. We have examined two severely obese children who are members of the same highly consanguineous pedigree. Their serum leptin levels were very low despite their markedly elevated fat mass and, in both, a homozygous frame-shift mutation involving the deletion of a single guanine nucleotide in codon 133 of the gene for leptin was found. The severe obesity found in these congenitally leptin-deficient subjects provides the first genetic evidence that leptin is an important regulator of energy balance in humans.

    head = To evaluate the possible role of leptin in the weight loss of anorexia nervosa, this study compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma leptin concentrations in 11 female patients with anorexia nervosa at low weight and after treatment and 15 healthy female controls.

    > Abstract
      Studies in rodents have shown that leptin acts in the central nervous system to modulate food intake and energy metabolism. To evaluate the possible role of leptin in the weight loss of anorexia nervosa, this study compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma leptin concentrations in anorexic patients and controls. Subjects included 11 female patients with anorexia nervosa studied at low weight and after treatment, and 15 healthy female controls. Concentrations of leptin in blood and CSF were measured by RIA. Patients with anorexia nervosa, compared to controls, had decreased concentrations of leptin in CSF (98 ± 26 vs. 160 ± 58 pg/mL; P < 0.0005) and plasma (1.75 ± 0.46 vs. 7.01 ± 3.92 ng/mL; P < 0.005). The CSF to plasma leptin ratio, however, was higher for patients (0.060 ± 0.023) than for controls (0.025 ± 0.007; P < 0.0001). At posttreatment testing, although patients had not yet reached normal body weight, CSF and plasma leptin concentrations had increased to normal levels. These results demonstrate the dynamic changes in plasma and CSF leptin during positive energy balance in anorexia nervosa. The results further suggest that normalization of CSF leptin levels before full weight restoration during treatment of anorexic patients could contribute to resistance to weight gain and/or incomplete weight recovery.

    head = To understand the role of leptin in severe malnutrition, in the present work 10 patients recently diagnosed with anorexia nervosa were studied both before and 2 months later, after partial weight recovery, and were compared with 18 normal-weight women as controls.

    > Abstract
      Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a recently discovered hormone secreted by adipocytes. Serum leptin concentrations increase in correlation with the percentage of body fat, but besides that little is known about the physiological actions of leptin in humans. In order to understand the role of leptin in severe malnutrition, in the present work 10 patients recently diagnosed with anorexia nervosa were studied both before and 2 months later, after partial weight recovery, and were compared with 18 normal-weight women as controls. Leptin was measured by a newly developed radioimmunoassay and both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured by commercial radioimmunoassays. The mean (±SE) serum leptin concentrations (in μg/liter) were 18.1 ± 2.0 in control women with BMI of 21.1 ± 0.3, significantly higher (P< 0.01) than that in the anorexia nervosa patients at diagnosis (2.2 ± 0.1, BMI 15.3 ± 0.6). These differences were also observed in IGF-I values (μg/liter) that were 228.0 ± 14.6 in controls and 157.4 ± 28.7 in anorexia nervosa patients (P< 0.02). No differences were observed in IGF-BP3. After treatment, patients with anorexia nervosa experienced an increase in BMI (17.1 ± 0.5,P< 0.0001 vs before) although they were still underweight. The partial recovery in weight led to a complete normalization of IGF-I levels (214.0 ± 21.0 μg/liter) and to an enhancement in leptin levels (3.3 ± 0.5 μg/liter;P< 0.03 vs before treatment), though still lower than those in normal-weight women (P < 0.05). Individually analyzed, a large dispersion was observed in control subjects, with leptin levels ranging from 5.5 to 38.7 μg/liter, while in all anorexia nervosa patients leptin levels were under 3 μg/liter. A treatment-induced increase in body weight led to an increase in leptin levels in 7 out of the 10 anorexia nervosa patients studied and the 3 patients with no increase in leptin were all initially under the 14.5 BMI. In conclusion, leptin levels are severely reduced in anorexia nervosa patients with severe malnutrition, and a significant rise occurred after partial weight recovery. There seems to be a level of BMI below which leptin levels do not drop further but also do not increase despite weight gain. While IGF-I reflects the energy intake of the previous few weeks, the serum leptin concentration reflects the true status of the adipose stores, a fact that has useful clinical implications.

    head = To investigate whether individuals prone to weight gain are hypoleptinemic, we measured fasting plasma leptin concentrations in two groups of weight-matched nondiabetic Pima Indians followed for approximately 3 years

    > Abstract
      Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a hormone, produced by adipose cells, that inhibits food intake and increases energy expenditure in rodents. In humans, plasma leptin concentrations correlate closely with the size of the adipose tissue depot; however, there is considerable variation in plasma leptin concentrations at any given degree of fatness. To investigate whether individuals prone to weight gain are hypoleptinemic, we measured fasting plasma leptin concentrations in two groups of weight-matched nondiabetic Pima Indians followed for approximately 3 years, 19 of whom subsequently gained weight and 17 of whom maintained their weight. After we adjusted for initial percent body fat, mean plasma leptin concentration was lower in those who gained weight than in those whose weight was stable. These data indicate that relatively low plasma leptin concentrations may play a role in the development of obesity in Pima Indians, a population prone to obesity.

    > Abstract
      Recent data have identified leptin as an afferent signal in a negative-feedback loop regulating the mass of the adipose tissue. High leptin levels are observed in obese humans and rodents, suggesting that, in some cases, obesity is the result of leptin insensitivity. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the response to peripherally and centrally administered leptin among lean and three obese strains of mice: diet-induced obese AKR/J, New Zealand Obese (NZO), and Ay. Subcutaneous leptin infusion to lean mice resulted in a dose-dependent loss of body weight at physiologic plasma levels. Chronic infusions of leptin intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at doses of 3 ng/hr or greater resulted in complete depletion of visible adipose tissue, which was maintained throughout 30 days of continuous i.c.v. infusion. Direct measurement of energy balance indicated that leptin treatment did not increase total energy expenditure but prevented the decrease that follows reduced food intake. Diet-induced obese mice lost weight in response to peripheral leptin but were less sensitive than lean mice. NZO mice were unresponsive to peripheral leptin but were responsive to i.c.v. leptin. Ay mice did not respond to subcutaneous leptin and were 1/100 as sensitive to i.c.v. leptin. The decreased response to leptin in diet-induced obese, NZO, and Ay mice suggests that obesity in these strains is the result of leptin resistance. In NZO mice, leptin resistance may be the result of decreased transport of leptin into the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas in Ay mice, leptin resistance probably results from defects downstream of the leptin receptor in the hypothalamus.

  ref 'Leibel_et_al_03_09_1994
    head = The bulk of evidence suggests that the plasma level of one or more currently unidentified stable circulating molecules increases in proportion to total body fat content and augments the effect of meal-related satiety signals in the central nervous system. The implications of this adipose tissue-related satiety factor for the pathogenesis of obesity, and the possible nature of the factor are discussed.

    > Abstract
      Stability of body composition requires that energy intake equals energy expenditure when integrated over prolonged periods. As recent human studies have failed to demonstrate active changes in energy expenditure with changes in body composition, it is likely that energy intake is continually adjusted to preserve a constant total adipose tissue mass. If adipose tissue mass is regulated directly, then there must be some input reflecting this quantity to the central nervous system for the purpose of making corrective changes in appetite when total body fat content fluctuates. The nature of this input has been examined in a variety of animal experiments involving induced weight change, lipectomy, plasma transfer from obese or satiated animals to hungry animals, and parabiosis between obese and lean animals. The bulk of evidence suggests that the plasma level of one or more currently unidentified stable circulating molecules increases in proportion to total body fat content and augments the effect of meal-related satiety signals in the central nervous system. The implications of this adipose tissue-related satiety factor for the pathogenesis of obesity, and the possible nature of the factor are discussed

The ob mRNA was identified in both subcutaneous and mesenteric fat tissues in the control rats. In VMH-lesioned rats, the abundance of ob mRNA increased after the gain of body weight and marked expression was observed on 15th day after making VMH lesion.

    > Abstract
      The gene product of the recently cloned mouse obese gene (ob) is important in regulating adipose tissue mass. ob RNA is expressed specifically by mouse adipocytes in vivo in each of several different fat cell depots, including brown fat. ob RNA is also expressed in cultured 3T3-442A preadipocyte cells that have been induced to differentiate. Mice with lesions of the hypothalamus, as well as mice mutant at the db locus, express a 20-fold higher level of ob RNA in adipose tissue. These data suggest that both the db gene and the hypothalamus are downstream of the ob gene in the pathway that regulates adipose tissue mass and are consistent with previous experiments suggesting that the db locus encodes the ob receptor. In db/db and lesioned mice, quantitative differences in expression level of ob RNA correlated with adipocyte lipid content. The molecules that regulate expression level of the ob gene in adipocytes probably are important in determining body weight, as are the molecules that mediate the effects of ob at its site of action.

  // Advances in understanding the interrelations between leptin resistance and obesity

    head = We  review the major advances that led to our current understanding of the possible mechanisms underlying leptin resistance, the exact interrelation between leptin resistance and obesity, and the role of leptin signals and leptin resistance in the regulation of the obese pathophysiological processes. Additionally, some effective treatments of leptin resistance are also discussed.

    > Abstract
      Obesity, which has developed into a global epidemic, is a risk factor in most chronic diseases and some forms of malignancy. The discovery of leptin in 1994 has opened a new field in obesity research. Currently, we know that leptin is the primary signal from energy stores and exerts negative feedback effects on energy intake. However, most individuals with diet-induced obesity (DIO) develop leptin resistance, which is characterized by elevated circulating leptin levels and decreased leptin sensitivity. To date, though various mechanisms have been proposed to explain leptin resistance, the exact mechanisms of leptin resistance in obesity are poorly understood. Consequently, it's an important issue worth discussing regarding what the exact interrelations between leptin resistance and obesity are. Here, we review the latest advancements in the molecular mechanisms of leptin resistance and the exact interrelations between leptin resistance, obesity, and obesity-related diseases, in order to supply new ideas for the study of obesity.

  // Regulated expression of the obese gene product (leptin) in white adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.20.9034
  ref 'MacDougald_et_al_09_26_2013
    head = Upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, the leptin mRNA was expressed concomitant with mRNAs encoding adipocyte marker proteins.

    > Abstract
      A mutation within the obese gene was recently identified as the genetic basis for obesity in the ob/ob mouse. The obese gene product, leptin, is a 16-kDa protein expressed predominantly in adipose tissue. Consistent with leptin's postulated role as an extracellular signaling protein, human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with the obese gene secreted leptin with minimal intracellular accumulation. Upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, the leptin mRNA was expressed concomitant with mRNAs encoding adipocyte marker proteins. A factor(s) present in calf serum markedly activated expression of leptin by fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A 16-hr fast decreased (by approximately 85%) the leptin mRNA level of adipose tissue of lean (ob/+ or +/+) mice but had no effect on the approximately 4-fold higher level in obese (ob/ob) littermates. Since the mutation at the ob locus fails to produce the functional protein, yet its cognate mRNA is overproduced, it appears that leptin is necessary for its own downregulation. Leptin mRNA was also suppressed in adipose tissue of rats during a 16-hr fast and was rapidly induced during a 4-hr refeeding period. Insulin deficiency provoked by streptozotocin also markedly down-regulated leptin mRNA and this suppression was rapidly reversed by insulin. These results suggest that insulin may regulate the expression of leptin.

Plasma leptin was found to be highly correlated with body mass index (BMI) in rodents and in 87 lean and obese humans. In humans, there was variability in plasma leptin at each BMI suggesting that there are differences in its secretion rate from fat. Weight loss due to food restriction was associated with a decrease in plasma leptin in samples from mice and obese humans.

      A responsible gene of genetically obese (ob/ob) mouse has recently been isolated. Genetic disruption of ob gene causes massive obesity. To elucidate the pathophysiological regulation of ob gene, we examined the gene expression in fat tissues of a non-genetical obese model, VMH-lesioned rats. The ob mRNA was identified in both subcutaneous and mesenteric fat tissues in the control rats. In VMH-lesioned rats, the abundance of ob mRNA increased after the gain of body weight and marked expression was observed on 15th day after making VMH lesion. These data suggest that ob gene might be upregulated with fat accumulation even in non-genetically obese animals.

    > Abstract
      The gene product of the ob locus is important in the regulation of body weight. The ob product was shown to be present as a 16-kilodalton protein in mouse and human plasma but was undetectable in plasma from C57BL/6J ob/ob mice. Plasma levels of this protein were increased in diabetic (db) mice, a mutant thought to be resistant to the effects of ob. Daily intraperitoneal injections of either mouse or human recombinant OB protein reduced the body weight of ob/ob mice by 30 percent after 2 weeks of treatment with no apparent toxicity but had no effect on db/db mice. The protein reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure in ob/ob mice. Injections of wild-type mice twice daily with the mouse protein resulted in a sustained 12 percent weight loss, decreased food intake, and a reduction of body fat from 12.2 to 0.7 percent. These data suggest that the OB protein serves an endocrine function to regulate body fat stores.

    > Abstract
      The young rat adjusts its food intake so precisely to its energy needs that its fat stores remain almost constant. Considerable variation in food intake is brought about in response to change in heat loss to the environment, or in loss of food through the mammary gland in lactation, without appreciable change of weight. Hypothalamic damage permits excessive intake and causes obesity. The degree of obesity and in general its rate of development, is a function of the degree of dam age to the region of the tuber cinereum , and is independent of changes of intake with environmental temperature. It is suggested that the hypothalamic satiety mechanism is concerned only in the prevention of an overall surplus of energy intake over expenditure, which would cause the deposition of fat in the depots. The simplest way in which this lipostasis could be achieved is b y sensitivity to the concentration of circulating metabolites. There is no disturbance of temperature regulation or acclimatization to changed environmental temperature in obese rats. These findings do not support the suggestion made by Brobeck (1946) that food intake is controlled as part of the normal regulation of body temperature by a thermosensitive hypothalamic centre. The maximum daily in take of food during hyperphagia appears to be determined by some limiting factor additional to the hypothalamic mechanism. A similar factor appears to operate in lactation. Reasons are advanced for regarding this as the limiting rate at which absorbed foodstuffs can be removed from the circulation, that is as some aspect of the synthesis or transport of fat.

    > Summary
      The diabetes syndromes produced by the two single gene mutations, obese (ob), and diabetes (db) are identical when both genes are expressed on the same inbred background, whereas on different backgrounds the syndrome changes from a severeobesity, moderate-diabetes to a severe life-shortening diabetes. The same initial sequence of events occurs in both conditions. Increased secretion of insulin and hyperphagia is followed by moderate hyperglycaemia with a further compensatory increase in insulin secretion followed by an expansion of the beta-cell mass. On the BL/6 inbred background, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the beta cells continues until hyperglycaemia is controlled, whereas on the BL/Ks background, beta cell expansion fails and islet atrophy occurs causing insulinopenia, marked hyperglycaemia, and severe diabetes. The data presented here suggest that hyperphagia, hyperinsulinaemia, or both, early in development trigger the abnormal sequence of metabolic events leading to the obesity-diabetes state. These primary events interact with unknown genetic modifiers to produce either a juvenile or maturity-onset type of diabetes. An understanding of the mode of action of these background modifiers influencing the severity of diabetes in mice should lead to a better understanding of the ways in which unknown genetic and environmental factors contribute to human diabetes.

    > Abstract
      Obesity presents a significant challenge to the general health of affluent nations in terms of the number of people affected, the serious associated maladies and the lack of effective treatments1–3. While common wisdom has held that obesity results from ‘gluttony and sloth’, a number of studies have indicated physiological causes underlying the pathogenesis of obesity2, with the degree of adiposity having a strong genetic component4,5. Recently, the obese gene in the ob/ob mouse was cloned, along with its human homologue6. The specific production of the obese protein by adipose tissue suggested that it may function in a feedback loop from fat tissue to the hypothalamus to control energy intake and/or energy expenditure, and that it may play a role in the pathogenesis of human obesity6–8. In this study we report that obese mRNA expression is elevated in ex vivo omental adipocytes isolated from massively obese humans in the absence of an identifiable mutation. Therefore, we speculate that this increased expression may suggest that the massively obese are insensitive to the putative regulatory function(s) of the obese gene product.

    > Abstract
      Obesity is accompanied by complications such as hypertension, non–insulin–dependent diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis, which in turn cause ischaemic heart disease, stroke and premature death. The underlying mechanisms behind imbalance in energy intake and energy expenditure that lead to obesity are still controversial. In most populations, obesity is more common among women than men and is a multifactorial phenotype, which may result from a complex network of genetic and nongenetic factors. The relative importance of genetic factors for obesity is under debate. Genome searches using polymorphic markers in inbred mice with phenotypes that result in extreme obesity and studies of human candidate genes are being performed in an attempt to identify genes that contribute to obesity. There is evidence that body weight is physiologically regulated and it has been postulated that the storage of fat may provide signals to the brain that the body is obese, which in turn may make the subject eat less and burn more fuel. One of the molecules that may be involved in such signalling is the obese (ob) gene product. Mutations in ob result in profound obesity and type II diabetes in mice. The mouse ob gene and its human homologue have been cloned and sequenced. The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and the product has features of a secreted protein. We have investigated human ob expression in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue obtained from non–obese and massively obese subjects using in situ hybridization histochemistry and report on overexpression in obese people.

  ref 'Consideine_et_al_02_01_1996
    head = This study measured serum concentrations of leptin in 136 normal-weight subjects and 139 obese subjects


    > Background
      Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a hormone secreted by adipocytes. Animals with mutations in the ob gene are obese and lose weight when given leptin, but little is known about the physiologic actions of leptin in humans.

    > Methods
      Using a newly developed radioimmunoassay, we measured serum concentrations of leptin in 136 normal-weight subjects and 139 obese subjects (body-mass index, >27.3 for men and >27.8 for women; the body-mass index was defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters). The measurements were repeated in seven obese subjects after weight loss and during maintenance of the lower weight. The ob messenger RNA (mRNA) content of adipocytes was determined in 27 normal-weight and 27 obese subjects.

    > Results
      The mean (±SD) serum leptin concentrations were 31.3±24.1 ng per milliliter in the obese subjects and 7.5±9.3 ng per milliliter in the normal-weight subjects (P<0.001). There was a strong positive correlation between serum leptin concentrations and the percentage of body fat (r = 0.85, P<0.001). The ob mRNA content of adipocytes was about twice as high in the obese subjects as in the normal-weight subjects (P = 0.005) and was correlated with the percentage of body fat (r = 0.68, P<0.001) in the 54 subjects in whom it was measured. In the seven obese subjects studied after weight loss, both serum leptin concentrations and ob mRNA content of adipocytes declined, but these measures increased again during the maintenance of the lower weight.

    > Conclusions
      Serum leptin concentrations are correlated with the percentage of body fat, suggesting that most obese persons are insensitive to endogenous leptin production.

    > Abstract
      The existence of mice (ob/ob mice) with a genetic defect causing obesity and type II diabetes has been known since 1950. The mutated ob gene was recently identified and characterized. The gene encodes a 167 amino acid protein that has been given the name leptin, from the greek word leptos, meaning thin. The functionally active hormone, which is synthesised and secreted by adipocytes, is lacking in homozygote ob/ob mice, causing an increase in body fat. Injection of recombinant leptin in ob/ob mice induces loss of fat due to decreased appetite and increased energy expenditure. The ob gene product leptin acts via binding sites in the hypothalamus, where the centre for appetite and satiety is located. Research is now focused on the identification, characterization and cloning of leptin-receptors. Other mice, also with a genetic defect causing obesity and type II diabetes, do not respond to leptin treatment and are therefore suspected to have defective leptin receptors.

  // Effects of the obese gene product on body weight regulation in ob/ob mice
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7624776
  ref 'Pelleymounter_et_al_07_28_1995
    head = This study test the hypothesis that the recently cloned obese gene is involved in the regulation of adiposity by administering the OB protein to ob/ob mice.

    > Abstract
      C57BL/6J mice with a mutation in the obese (ob)gene are obese, diabetic, and exhibit reduced activity, metabolism, and body temperature. Daily intraperitoneal injection of these mice with recombinant OB protein lowered their body weight, percent body fat, food intake, and serum concentrations of glucose and insulin. In addition, metabolic rate, body temperature, and activity levels were increased by this treatment. None of these parameters was altered beyond the level observed in lean controls, suggesting that the OB protein normalized the metabolic status of the ob/ob mice. Lean animals injected with OB protein maintained a smaller weight loss throughout the 28-day study and showed no changes in any of the metabolic parameters. These data suggest that the OB protein regulates body weight and fat deposition through effects on metabolism and appetite.

    > Abstract
      The mechanisms that balance food intake and energy expenditure determine who will be obese and who will be lean. One of the molecules that regulates energy balance in the mouse is the obese (ob) gene. Mutation of ob results in profound obesity and type II diabetes as part of a syndrome that resembles morbid obesity in humans. The ob gene product may function as part of a signalling pathway from adipose tissue that acts to regulate the size of the body fat depot.

  // Body Weight Set-Points: Determination and Adjustment
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/127.9.1875S
  ref 'Keesey_et_al_09_01_1997
    head = This review dealt with the issue of how body weight is regulated and how, by an analysis of daily energy flux, the particular weight level that an individuals system is set to maintain might be specified.

    > Abstract
      It is proposed that body weight, like body water and body temperature, is physiologically regulated. In the case of body weight, coordinated adjustments in both the intake and expenditure of energy serve to stabilize the weights of individuals at a specified level and to resist their displacement from this level. Obese individuals also display these behavioral and metabolic adjustments to weight perturbations and thus appear to actively resist efforts to reduce their weight from the elevated levels they ordinarily display. Experimental studies of genetically transmitted and diet-induced forms of obesity in animals similarly suggest a view of obesity as a condition of body energy regulation at an elevated set-point. An individual's set-point for regulated body weight is apparently adjustable, shifting over a lifespan in conjunction with naturally occurring but still unspecified physiologic changes. Experimentally, the set-point for body weight can be adjusted by manipulation of specific hypothalamic sites. Lesions of the lateral hypothalamus, for example, cause a chronic reduction in the level at which laboratory animals regulate body weight. It thus appears that hypothalamic mechanisms play a primary role in setting the level at which individuals regulate body weight, and it is likely that the genetic, dietary and other lifespan influences on body weight are expressed through these mechanisms.

    / September, 1997 - The Journal of Nutrition
    quote !f = It was noted that the general lack of success in treating obesity by dietary means is certainly consistent with such an interpretation.Efforts to lose weight by dieting are resisted not only by enhanced appetite but by a reduced rate of whole-body energy expenditure. Thus, even when weight loss does occur, the resulting adjustments in energy expenditure favor its recovery. Under such circumstances, the goal of normalizing the body weight of an obese individual through dieting may be unrealistic.

    / September, 1997 - The Journal of Nutrition
    quote !g = It was observed that the obese can realize significant benefits from the physiologic adjustments that occur with diet-induced weight loss. Among these are an attenuation of obesity-related hypertension and hyperinsulinemia.

    # quote !i = if obesity is indeed a regulated condition, it should not be necessary to restore body weight to normal levels to achieve these benefits. Even a modest drop in body weight from set-point should produce in an obese individual essentially the same physiologic adjustments, and the associated benefits, that one sees when a person of normal body weight loses weight.

    # / September, 1997 - The Journal of Nutrition

    # / September, 1997 - The Journal of Nutrition
    # quote !l = Experiments were described demonstrating that the set-point for regulated body energy can be chronically lowered by direct manipulation of these hypothalamic mechanisms. While such experimental procedures for reducing the body weight set-point are not suitable for obesity treatment, it is proposed that a better understanding of mechanisms by which they bring about these adjustments can point the way to safe and effective means of lowering the level an individual's energy-regulating system is set to maintain.

    quote !a = To begin with, the weight loss was minimal. During the week they spent at 2,650 meters, patients lost an average of 3 pounds (1.5 kg). They were an average of 232 lbs (105.1 kg) to begin with, so this is only about 1% of their body weight. Going from 232 lbs (105.1 kg) to 229 lbs (103.6 kg) doesn’t seem clinically relevant, or even all that noticeable. The authors, surprisingly, agree: “the absolute amount of weight loss was so small.”
