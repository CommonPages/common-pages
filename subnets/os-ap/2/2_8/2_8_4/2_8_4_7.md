name: Phalanges

The toes contain a total of 14 phalanx bones (phalanges), arranged in a similar manner as the phalanges of the fingers (see {'Figure_8_4_4 Figure 8.4.4}). The toes are numbered 1â€“5, starting with the big toe ( **hallux**). The big toe has two phalanx bones, the proximal and distal phalanges. The remaining toes all have proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. A joint between adjacent phalanx bones is called an interphalangeal joint.
