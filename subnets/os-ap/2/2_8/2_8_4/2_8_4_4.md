name: Fibula

The fibula is the slender bone located on the lateral side of the leg (see {'Figure_8_4_3 Figure 8.4.3}). The fibula does not bear weight. It serves primarily for muscle attachments and thus is largely surrounded by muscles. Only the proximal and distal ends of the fibula can be palpated.

The  **head of the fibula** is the small, knob-like, proximal end of the fibula. It articulates with the inferior aspect of the lateral tibial condyle, forming the  **proximal tibiofibular joint**. The thin  **shaft of the fibula** has the  **interosseous border of the fibula**, a narrow ridge running down its medial side for the attachment of the interosseous membrane that spans the fibula and tibia. The distal end of the fibula forms the  **lateral malleolus**, which forms the easily palpated bony bump on the lateral side of the ankle. The deep (medial) side of the lateral malleolus articulates with the talus bone of the foot as part of the ankle joint. The distal fibula also articulates with the fibular notch of the tibia.
