name: Metatarsal Bones

The anterior half of the foot is formed by the five metatarsal bones, which are located between the tarsal bones of the posterior foot and the phalanges of the toes (see {'Figure_8_4_4 Figure 8.4.4}). These elongated bones are numbered 1â€“5, starting with the medial side of the foot. The first metatarsal bone is shorter and thicker than the others. The second metatarsal is the longest. The  **base of the metatarsal bone** is the proximal end of each metatarsal bone. These articulate with the cuboid or cuneiform bones. The base of the fifth metatarsal has a large, lateral expansion that provides for muscle attachments. This expanded base of the fifth metatarsal can be felt as a bony bump at the midpoint along the lateral border of the foot. The expanded distal end of each metatarsal is the  **head of the metatarsal bone**. Each metatarsal bone articulates with the proximal phalanx of a toe to form a  **metatarsophalangeal joint**. The heads of the metatarsal bones also rest on the ground and form the ball (anterior end) of the foot.
