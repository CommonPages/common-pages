name: Phalanx Bones

The fingers and thumb contain 14 bones, each of which is called a phalanx bone (plural = phalanges), named after the ancient Greek phalanx (a rectangular block of soldiers). The thumb ( **pollex**) is digit number 1 and has two phalanges, a proximal phalanx, and a distal phalanx bone (see {'Figure_8_2_3 Figure 8.2.3}). Digits 2 (index finger) through 5 (little finger) have three phalanges each, called the proximal, middle, and distal phalanx bones. An  **interphalangeal joint** is one of the articulations between adjacent phalanges of the digits (see {'Figure_8_2_4 Figure 8.2.4}).
