name: Mineral Storage, Energy Storage, and Hematopoiesis

On a metabolic level, bone tissue performs several critical functions. For one, the bone matrix acts as a reservoir for a number of minerals important to the functioning of the body, especially calcium, and phosphorus. These minerals, incorporated into bone tissue, can be released back into the bloodstream to maintain levels needed to support physiological processes. Calcium ions, for example, are essential for muscle contractions and controlling the flow of other ions involved in the transmission of nerve impulses.

Bone also serves as a site for fat storage and blood cell production. The softer connective tissue that fills the interior of most bone is referred to as bone marrow ({'Figure_6_1_4 Figure 6.1.4}). There are two types of bone marrow: yellow marrow and red marrow.  **Yellow marrow** contains adipose tissue; the triglycerides stored in the adipocytes of the tissue can serve as a source of energy.  **Red marrow** is where  **hematopoiesis**—the production of blood cells—takes place. Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are all produced in the red marrow.
