name: Sesamoid Bones

A  **sesamoid bone** is a small, round bone that, as the name suggests, is shaped like a sesame seed. These bones form in tendons (the sheaths of tissue that connect bones to muscles) where a great deal of pressure is generated in a joint. The sesamoid bones protect tendons by helping them overcome compressive forces. Sesamoid bones vary in number and placement from person to person but are typically found in tendons associated with the feet, hands, and knees. The patellae (singular = patella) are the only sesamoid bones found in common with every person.  reviews bone classifications with their associated features, functions, and examples.


****

| Bone classification | Features | Function(s) | Examples |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Long | Cylinder-like shape, longer than it is wide | Leverage | Femur, tibia, fibula, metatarsals, humerus, ulna, radius, metacarpals, phalanges |
| Short | Cube-like shape, approximately equal in length, width, and thickness | Provide stability, support, while allowing for some motion | Carpals, tarsals |
| Flat | Thin and curved | Points of attachment for muscles; protectors of internal organs | Sternum, ribs, scapulae, cranial bones |
| Irregular | Complex shape | Protect internal organs | Vertebrae, facial bones |
| Sesamoid | Small and round; embedded in tendons | Protect tendons from compressive forces | Patellae |
