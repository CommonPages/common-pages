When a bone breaks, blood flows from any vessel torn by the fracture. These vessels could be in the periosteum, osteons, and/or medullary cavity. The blood begins to clot, and about six to eight hours after the fracture, the clotting blood has formed a  **fracture hematoma** ({'Figure_6_5_2 Figure 6.5.2} **a**). The disruption of blood flow to the bone results in the death of bone cells around the fracture.

Within about 48 hours after the fracture, chondrocytes from the endosteum have created an  **internal callus** (plural = calli) by secreting a fibrocartilaginous matrix between the two ends of the broken bone, while the periosteal chondrocytes and osteoblasts create an  **external callus** of hyaline cartilage and bone, respectively, around the outside of the break  ({'Figure_6_5_2 Figure 6.5.2} **b**). This stabilizes the fracture.

Over the next several weeks, osteoclasts resorb the dead bone; osteogenic cells become active, divide, and differentiate into osteoblasts. The cartilage in the calli is replaced by trabecular bone via endochondral ossification ({'Figure_6_5_2 Figure 6.5.2} **c**).

Eventually, the internal and external calli unite, compact bone replaces spongy bone at the outer margins of the fracture, and healing is complete. A slight swelling may remain on the outer surface of the bone, but quite often, that region undergoes remodeling ({'Figure_6_5_2 Figure 6.5.2} **d**), and no external evidence of the fracture remains.
