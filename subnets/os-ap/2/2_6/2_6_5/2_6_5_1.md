name: Types of Fractures

Fractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other features ({'Figure_6_5_1 Figure 6.5.1}).  outlines common types of fractures. Some fractures may be described using more than one term because it may have the features of more than one type (e.g., an open transverse fracture).

| Type of fracture | Description |
|:-:|:-:|
| Transverse | Occurs straight across the long axis of the bone |
| Oblique | Occurs at an angle that is not 90 degrees |
| Spiral | Bone segments are pulled apart as a result of a twisting motion |
| Comminuted | Several breaks result in many small pieces between two large segments |
| Impacted | One fragment is driven into the other, usually as a result of compression |
| Greenstick | A partial fracture in which only one side of the bone is broken |
| Open (or compound) | A fracture in which at least one end of the broken bone tears through the skin; carries a high risk of infection |
| Closed (or simple) | A fracture in which the skin remains intact |
