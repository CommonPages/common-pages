name: Opposition and Reposition

 **Opposition** is the thumb movement that brings the tip of the thumb in contact with the tip of a finger. This movement is produced at the first carpometacarpal joint, which is a saddle joint formed between the trapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone. Thumb opposition is produced by a combination of flexion and abduction of the thumb at this joint. Returning the thumb to its anatomical position next to the index finger is called  **reposition** (see {'Figure_9_5_2 Figure 9.5.2} **l**).


****

| Type of Joint | Movement | Example |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Pivot | Uniaxial joint; allows rotational movement | Atlantoaxial joint (C1â€“C2 vertebrae articulation); proximal radioulnar joint |
| Hinge | Uniaxial joint; allows flexion/extension movements | Knee; elbow; ankle; interphalangeal joints of fingers and toes |
| Condyloid | Biaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and circumduction movements | Metacarpophalangeal (knuckle) joints of fingers; radiocarpal joint of wrist; metatarsophalangeal joints for toes |
| Saddle | Biaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and circumduction movements | First carpometacarpal joint of the thumb; sternoclavicular joint |
| Plane | Multiaxial joint; allows inversion and eversion of foot, or flexion, extension, and lateral flexion of the vertebral column | Intertarsal joints of foot; superior-inferior articular process articulations between vertebrae |
| Ball-and-socket | Multiaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction, and medial/lateral rotation movements | Shoulder and hip joints |
