name: Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion

 **Dorsiflexion** and  **plantar flexion** are movements at the ankle joint, which is a hinge joint. Lifting the front of the foot, so that the top of the foot moves toward the anterior leg is dorsiflexion, while lifting the heel of the foot from the ground or pointing the toes downward is plantar flexion. These are the only movements available at the ankle joint (see {'Figure_9_5_2 Figure 9.5.2} **h**).
