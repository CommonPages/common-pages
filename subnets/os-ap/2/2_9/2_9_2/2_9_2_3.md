name: Gomphosis

A  **gomphosis** (“fastened with bolts”) is the specialized fibrous joint that anchors the root of a tooth into its bony socket within the maxillary bone (upper jaw) or mandible bone (lower jaw) of the skull. A gomphosis is also known as a peg-and-socket joint. Spanning between the bony walls of the socket and the root of the tooth are numerous short bands of dense connective tissue, each of which is called a  **periodontal ligament** (see {'Figure_9_2_1 Figure 9.2.1} **c**). Due to the immobility of a gomphosis, this type of joint is functionally classified as a synarthrosis.
