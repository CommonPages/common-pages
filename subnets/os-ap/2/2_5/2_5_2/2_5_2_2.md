name: Nails

The nail bed is a specialized structure of the epidermis that is found at the tips of our fingers and toes. The  **nail body** is formed on the  **nail bed**, and protects the tips of our fingers and toes as they are the farthest extremities and the parts of the body that experience the maximum mechanical stress ({'Figure_5_2_3 Figure 5.2.3}). In addition, the nail body forms a back-support for picking up small objects with the fingers. The nail body is composed of densely packed dead keratinocytes. The epidermis in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form. The nail body forms at the  **nail root**, which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the stratum basale that enables the nail to grow continuously. The lateral  **nail fold** overlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The nail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms the  **nail cuticle**, also called the  **eponychium**. The nail bed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at the base, where a thick layer of epithelium over the nail matrix forms a crescent-shaped region called the  **lunula** (the “little moon”). The area beneath the free edge of the nail, furthest from the cuticle, is called the  **hyponychium**. It consists of a thickened layer of stratum corneum.
