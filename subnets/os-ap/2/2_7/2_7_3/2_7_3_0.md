name: The Vertebral Column - Introduction

The vertebral column is also known as the spinal column or spine ({'Figure_7_3_1 Figure 7.3.1}). It consists of a sequence of vertebrae (singular = vertebra), each of which is separated and united by an  **intervertebral disc**. Together, the vertebrae and intervertebral discs form the vertebral column. It is a flexible column that supports the head, neck, and body and allows for their movements. It also protects the spinal cord, which passes down the back through openings in the vertebrae.
