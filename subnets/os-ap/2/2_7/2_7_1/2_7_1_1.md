name: The Axial Skeleton

The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisionsâ€”the axial and appendicular. The  **axial skeleton** forms the vertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back ({'Figure_7_1_1 Figure 7.1.1}). It serves to protect the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs.

The axial skeleton of the adult consists of 80 bones, including the  **skull**, the  **vertebral column**, and the  **thoracic cage**. The skull is formed by 22 bones. Also associated with the head are an additional seven bones, including the  **hyoid bone** and the  **ear ossicles** (three small bones found in each middle ear). The vertebral column consists of 24 bones, each called a  **vertebra**, plus the  **sacrum** and  **coccyx**. The thoracic cage includes the 12 pairs of  **ribs**, and the  **sternum**, the flattened bone of the anterior chest.
