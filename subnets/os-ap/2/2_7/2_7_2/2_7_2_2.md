name: Lateral View of Skull

A view of the lateral skull is dominated by the large, rounded brain case above and the upper and lower jaws with their teeth below ({'Figure_7_2_3 Figure 7.2.3}). Separating these areas is the bridge of bone called the zygomatic arch. The  **zygomatic arch** is the bony arch on the side of skull that spans from the area of the cheek to just above the ear canal. It is formed by the junction of two bony processes: a short anterior component, the  **temporal process of the zygomatic bone** (the cheekbone) and a longer posterior portion, the  **zygomatic process of the temporal bone**, extending forward from the temporal bone. Thus the temporal process (anteriorly) and the zygomatic process (posteriorly) join together, like the two ends of a drawbridge, to form the zygomatic arch. One of the major muscles that pulls the mandible upward during biting and chewing arises from the zygomatic arch.

On the lateral side of the brain case, above the level of the zygomatic arch, is a shallow space called the  **temporal fossa**. Below the level of the zygomatic arch and deep to the vertical portion of the mandible is another space called the  **infratemporal fossa**. Both the temporal fossa and infratemporal fossa contain muscles that act on the mandible during chewing.
