name: The Thoracic Cage - Introduction

The thoracic cage (rib cage) forms the thorax (chest) portion of the body. It consists of the 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages and the sternum ({'Figure_7_4_1 Figure 7.4.1}). The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae (T1â€“T12). The thoracic cage protects the heart and lungs.
