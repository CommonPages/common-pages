name: Treppe

When a skeletal muscle has been dormant for an extended period and then activated to contract, with all other things being equal, the initial contractions generate about one-half the force of later contractions. The muscle tension increases in a graded manner that to some looks like a set of stairs. This tension increase is called  **treppe**, a condition where muscle contractions become more efficient. It’s also known as the “staircase effect” ({'Figure_10_4_5 Figure 10.4.5}).

It is believed that treppe results from a higher concentration of Ca<sup>++</sup> in the sarcoplasm resulting from the steady stream of signals from the motor neuron. It can only be maintained with adequate ATP.
