name: Skeletal Muscle Fibers

Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical, they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells, with diameters up to 100  *μ*m and lengths up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in the Sartorius of the upper leg. During early development, embryonic myoblasts, each with its own nucleus, fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers. Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes, permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction.

Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek  *sarco*, which means “flesh.” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the  **sarcolemma**, the cytoplasm is referred to as  **sarcoplasm**, and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which stores, releases, and retrieves calcium ions (Ca<sup>++</sup>) is called the  **sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)** ({'Figure_10_2_2 Figure 10.2.2}). As will soon be described, the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere, a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilaments  **actin** (thin filament) and  **myosin** (thick filament), along with other support proteins.
