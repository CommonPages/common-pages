name: Exercise and Muscle Performance - Introduction

Physical training alters the appearance of skeletal muscles and can produce changes in muscle performance. Conversely, a lack of use can result in decreased performance and muscle appearance. Although muscle cells can change in size, new cells are not formed when muscles grow. Instead, structural proteins are added to muscle fibers in a process called  **hypertrophy**, so cell diameter increases. The reverse, when structural proteins are lost and muscle mass decreases, is called  **atrophy**. Age-related muscle atrophy is called  **sarcopenia**. Cellular components of muscles can also undergo changes in response to changes in muscle use.
