name: Muscles That Move the Eyes

The movement of the eyeball is under the control of the  **extrinsic eye muscles**, which originate outside the eye and insert onto the outer surface of the white of the eye. These muscles are located inside the eye socket and cannot be seen on any part of the visible eyeball ({'Figure_11_3_3 Figure 11.3.3} and ). If you have ever been to a doctor who held up a finger and asked you to follow it up, down, and to both sides, he or she is checking to make sure your eye muscles are acting in a coordinated pattern.

| Movement | Target | Target motion direction | Prime mover | Origin | Insertion |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Moves eyes up and toward nose; rotates eyes from 1 o’clock to 3 o’clock | Eyeballs | Superior (elevates); medial (adducts) | Superior rectus | Common tendinous ring (ring attaches to optic foramen) | Superior surface of eyeball |
| Moves eyes down and toward nose; rotates eyes from 6 o’clock to 3 o’clock | Eyeballs | Inferior (depresses); medial (adducts) | Inferior rectus | Common tendinous ring (ring attaches to optic foramen) | Inferior surface of eyeball |
| Moves eyes away from nose | Eyeballs | Lateral (abducts) | Lateral rectus | Common tendinous ring (ring attaches to optic foramen) | Lateral surface of eyeball |
| Moves eyes toward nose | Eyeballs | Medial (adducts) | Medial rectus | Common tendinous ring (ring attaches to optic foramen) | Medial surface of eyeball |
| Moves eyes up and away from nose; rotates eyeball from 12 o’clock to 9 o’clock | Eyeballs | Superior (elevates); lateral (abducts) | Inferior oblique | Floor of orbit (maxilla) | Surface of eyeball between inferior rectus and lateral rectus |
| Moves eyes down and away from nose; rotates eyeball from 6 o’clock to 9 o’clock | Eyeballs | Superior (elevates); lateral (abducts) | Superior oblique | Sphenoid bone | Suface of eyeball between superior rectus and lateral rectus |
| Opens eyes | Upper eyelid | Superior (elevates) | Levator palpabrae superioris | Roof of orbit (sphenoid bone) | Skin of upper eyelids |
| Closes eyelids | Eyelid skin | Compression along superior–inferior axis | Orbicularis oculi | Medial bones composing the orbit | Circumference of orbit |
