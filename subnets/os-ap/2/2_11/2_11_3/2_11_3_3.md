name: Muscles That Move the Lower Jaw

In anatomical terminology, chewing is called  **mastication**. Muscles involved in chewing must be able to exert enough pressure to bite through and then chew food before it is swallowed ({'Figure_11_3_4 Figure 11.3.4} and ). The  **masseter** muscle is the main muscle used for chewing because it elevates the mandible (lower jaw) to close the mouth, and it is assisted by the  **temporalis** muscle, which retracts the mandible. You can feel the temporalis move by putting your fingers to your temple as you chew.

| Movement | Target | Target motion direction | Prime mover | Origin | Insertion |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Closes mouth; aids chewing | Mandible | Superior (elevates) | Masseter | Maxilla arch; zygomatic arch (for masseter) | Mandible |
| Closes mouth; pulls lower jaw in under upper jaw | Mandible | Superior (elevates); posterior (retracts) | Temporalis | Temporal bone | Mandible |
| Opens mouth; pushes lower jaw out under upper jaw; moves lower jaw side-to-side | Mandible | Inferior (depresses); posterior (protracts); lateral (abducts); medial (adducts) | Lateral pterygoid | Pterygoid process of sphenoid bone | Mandible |
| Closes mouth; pushes lower jaw out under upper jaw; moves lower jaw side-to-side | Mandible | Superior (elevates); posterior (protracts); lateral (abducts); medial (adducts) | Medial pterygoid | Sphenoid bone; maxilla | Mandible; temporo-mandibular joint |
    

Although the masseter and temporalis are responsible for elevating and closing the jaw to break food into digestible pieces, the  **medial pterygoid** and  **lateral pterygoid** muscles provide assistance in chewing and moving food within the mouth.
