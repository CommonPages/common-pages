name: Muscles That Position the Pectoral Girdle

Muscles that position the pectoral girdle are located either on the anterior thorax or on the posterior thorax ({'Figure_11_5_1 Figure 11.5.1} and ). The anterior muscles include the  **subclavius**,  **pectoralis minor**, and  **serratus anterior**. The posterior muscles include the  **trapezius**,  **rhomboid major**, and  **rhomboid minor**. When the rhomboids are contracted, your scapula moves medially, which can pull the shoulder and upper limb posteriorly.

| Position in the thorax | Movement | Target | Target motion direction | Prime mover | Origin | Insertion |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Anterior thorax | Stabilizes clavicle during movement by depressing it | Clavicle | Depression | Subclavius | First rib | Inferior surface of clavicle |
| Anterior thorax | Rotates shoulder anteriorly (throwing motion); assists with inhalation | Scapula; ribs | Scapula: depresses; ribs: elevates | Pectoralis minor | Anterior surfaces of certain ribs (2–4 or 3–5) | Coracoid process of scapula |
| Anterior thorax | Moves arm from side of body to front of body; assists with inhalation | Scapula; ribs | Scapula: protracts; ribs: elevates | Serratus anterior | Muscle slips from certain ribs (1–8 or 1–9) | Anterior surface of vertebral border of scapula |
| Posterior thorax | Elevates shoulders (shrugging); pulls shoulder blades together; tilts head backwards | Scapula; cervical spine | Scapula: rotests inferiorly, retracts, elevates, and depresses; spine: extends | Trapezius | Skull; vertebral column | Acromion and spine of scapula; clavicle |
| Posterior thorax | Stabilizes scapula during pectoral girdle movement | Scapula | Retracts; rotates inferiorly | Rhomboid major  | Thoracic vertebrae (T2–T5) | Medial border of scapula |
| Posterior thorax | Stabilizes scapula during pectoral girdle movement | Scapula | Retracts; rotates inferiorly | Rhomboid minor | Cervical and thoracic vertebrae (C7 and T1) | Medial border of scapula |
