name: Muscles That Move the Forearm

The forearm, made of the radius and ulna bones, has four main types of action at the hinge of the elbow joint: flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. The forearm flexors include the biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis. The extensors are the  **triceps brachii** and  **anconeus**. The pronators are the  **pronator teres** and the  **pronator quadratus**, and the  **supinator** is the only one that turns the forearm anteriorly. When the forearm faces anteriorly, it is supinated. When the forearm faces posteriorly, it is pronated.

The biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis flex the forearm. The two-headed  **biceps brachii** crosses the shoulder and elbow joints to flex the forearm, also taking part in supinating the forearm at the radioulnar joints and flexing the arm at the shoulder joint. Deep to the biceps brachii, the  **brachialis** provides additional power in flexing the forearm. Finally, the  **brachioradialis** can flex the forearm quickly or help lift a load slowly. These muscles and their associated blood vessels and nerves form the  **anterior compartment of the arm** (anterior flexor compartment of the arm) ({'Figure_11_5_4 Figure 11.5.4} and {'Figure_11_5_5 Figure 11.5.5}).
