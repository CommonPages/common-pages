# Regulation of H<sup>+</sup>, Bicarbonate, and pH

The acid–base homeostasis of the body is a function of chemical buffers and physiologic buffering provided by the lungs and kidneys. Buffers, especially proteins, <math display="left" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"> <semantics>  <mrow>   <msubsup>    <mrow>     <mtext>HCO</mtext>    </mrow>    <mn>3</mn>    <mrow>     <mn>2</mn><mo>−</mo>    </mrow>   </msubsup>     </mrow>  <annotation encoding="MathType-MTEF">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaagyart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLnhiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq=Jc9vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0=yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr=xfr=xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaaeisaiaaboeacaqGpbWaa0baaSqaaiaaiodaaeaacaaIYaGaeyOeI0caaaaa@3AE9@</annotation> </semantics></math>, and ammonia have a very large capacity to absorb or release H<sup>+</sup> as needed to resist a change in pH. They can act within fractions of a second. The lungs can rid the body of excess acid very rapidly (seconds to minutes) through the conversion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> into CO<sub>2</sub>, which is then exhaled. It is rapid but has limited capacity in the face of a significant acid challenge. The kidneys can rid the body of both acid and base. The renal capacity is large but slow (minutes to hours). The cells of the PCT actively secrete H<sup>+</sup> into the forming urine as Na<sup>+</sup> is reabsorbed. The body rids itself of excess H<sup>+</sup> and raises blood pH. In the collecting ducts, the apical surfaces of intercalated cells have proton pumps that actively secrete H<sup>+</sup> into the luminal, forming urine to remove it from the body.

As hydrogen ions are pumped into the forming urine, it is buffered by bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>), H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>– </sup>(dihydrogen phosphate ion), or ammonia (forming NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, ammonium ion). Urine pH typically varies in a normal range from 4.5 to 8.0.
