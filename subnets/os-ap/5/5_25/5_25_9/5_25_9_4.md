# Regulation of Extracellular K<sup>+</sup>

Potassium is present in a 30-fold greater concentration inside the cell than outside the cell. A generalization can be made that K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations will move in opposite directions. When more Na<sup>+</sup> is reabsorbed, more K<sup>+</sup> is secreted; when less Na<sup>+</sup> is reabsorbed (leading to excretion by the kidney), more K<sup>+</sup> is retained. When aldosterone causes a recovery of Na<sup>+</sup> in the nephron, a negative electrical gradient is created that promotes the secretion of K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>â€“ </sup>into the lumen.
