name: Regulation of Nitrogen Wastes

Nitrogen wastes are produced by the breakdown of proteins during normal metabolism. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which in turn are deaminated by having their nitrogen groups removed. Deamination converts the amino (NH<sub>2</sub>) groups into ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), urea, or uric acid ({'Figure_26_9_1 Figure 26.9.1}). Ammonia is extremely toxic, so most of it is very rapidly converted into urea in the liver. Human urinary wastes typically contain primarily urea with small amounts of ammonium and very little uric acid.
