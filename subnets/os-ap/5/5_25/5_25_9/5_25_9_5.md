# Regulation of Cl<sup>–</sup>

Chloride is important in acid–base balance in the extracellular space and has other functions, such as in the stomach, where it combines with hydrogen ions in the stomach lumen to form hydrochloric acid, aiding digestion. Its close association with Na<sup>+</sup> in the extracellular environment makes it the dominant anion of this compartment, and its regulation closely mirrors that of Na<sup>+</sup>.
