# Regulation of Extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>

Sodium has a very strong osmotic effect and attracts water. It plays a larger role in the osmolarity of the plasma than any other circulating component of the blood. If there is too much Na<sup>+</sup> present, either due to poor control or excess dietary consumption, a series of metabolic problems ensue. There is an increase in total volume of water, which leads to hypertension (high blood pressure). Over a long period, this increases the risk of serious complications such as heart attacks, strokes, and aneurysms. It can also contribute to system-wide edema (swelling).

Mechanisms for regulating Na<sup>+</sup> concentration include the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and ADH (see {'Figure_26_4_4 Figure 26.4.4}). Aldosterone stimulates the uptake of Na<sup>+</sup> on the apical cell membrane of cells in the DCT and collecting ducts, whereas ADH helps to regulate Na<sup>+</sup> concentration indirectly by regulating the reabsorption of water.
