name: Blood Pressure Regulation

Due to osmosis, water follows where Na<sup>+</sup> leads. Much of the water the kidneys recover from the forming urine follows the reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup>. ADH stimulation of aquaporin channels allows for regulation of water recovery in the collecting ducts. Normally, all of the glucose is recovered, but loss of glucose control (diabetes mellitus) may result in an osmotic dieresis severe enough to produce severe dehydration and death. A loss of renal function means a loss of effective vascular volume control, leading to hypotension (low blood pressure) or hypertension (high blood pressure), which can lead to stroke, heart attack, and aneurysm formation.

The kidneys cooperate with the lungs, liver, and adrenal cortex through the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (see {'Figure_26_4_4 Figure 26.4.4}). The liver synthesizes and secretes the inactive precursor angiotensinogen. When the blood pressure is low, the kidney synthesizes and releases renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, and ACE produced in the lung converts angiotensin I into biologically active angiotensin II ({'Figure_26_10_1 Figure 26.10.1}). The immediate and short-term effect of angiotensin II is to raise blood pressure by causing widespread vasoconstriction. angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release the steroid hormone aldosterone, which results in renal reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and its associated osmotic recovery of water. The reabsorption of Na<sup>+ </sup>helps to raise and maintain blood pressure over a longer term.
