The effects of failure of parts of the urinary system may range from inconvenient (incontinence) to fatal (loss of filtration and many others). The kidneys catalyze the final reaction in the synthesis of active vitamin D that in turn helps regulate Ca<sup>++</sup>. The kidney hormone EPO stimulates erythrocyte development and promotes adequate O<sub>2</sub> transport. The kidneys help regulate blood pressure through Na<sup>+</sup> and water retention and loss. The kidneys work with the adrenal cortex, lungs, and liver in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system to regulate blood pressure. They regulate osmolarity of the blood by regulating both solutes and water. Three electrolytes are more closely regulated than others: Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>. The kidneys share pH regulation with the lungs and plasma buffers, so that proteins can preserve their three-dimensional conformation and thus their function.
