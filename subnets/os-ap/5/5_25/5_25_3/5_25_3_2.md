name: Internal Anatomy

A frontal section through the kidney reveals an outer region called the  **renal cortex** and an inner region called the  **medulla** ({'Figure_26_3_2 Figure 26.3.2}). The  **renal columns** are connective tissue extensions that radiate downward from the cortex through the medulla to separate the most characteristic features of the medulla, the  **renal pyramids** and  **renal papillae**. The papillae are bundles of collecting ducts that transport urine made by nephrons to the  **calyces** of the kidney for excretion. The renal columns also serve to divide the kidney into 6â€“8 lobes and provide a supportive framework for vessels that enter and exit the cortex. The pyramids and renal columns taken together constitute the kidney lobes.
