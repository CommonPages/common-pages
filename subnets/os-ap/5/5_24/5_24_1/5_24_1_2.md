name: Anabolic Reactions

In contrast to catabolic reactions,  **anabolic reactions** involve the joining of smaller molecules into larger ones. Anabolic reactions combine monosaccharides to form polysaccharides, fatty acids to form triglycerides, amino acids to form proteins, and nucleotides to form nucleic acids. These processes require energy in the form of ATP molecules generated by catabolic reactions. Anabolic reactions, also called  **biosynthesis reactions**, create new molecules that form new cells and tissues, and revitalize organs.
