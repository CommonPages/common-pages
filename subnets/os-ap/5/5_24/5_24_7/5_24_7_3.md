name: Minerals

 **Minerals** in food are inorganic compounds that work with other nutrients to ensure the body functions properly. Minerals cannot be made in the body; they come from the diet. The amount of minerals in the body is small—only 4 percent of the total body mass—and most of that consists of the minerals that the body requires in moderate quantities: potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and chloride.

The most common minerals in the body are calcium and phosphorous, both of which are stored in the skeleton and necessary for the hardening of bones. Most minerals are ionized, and their ionic forms are used in physiological processes throughout the body. Sodium and chloride ions are electrolytes in the blood and extracellular tissues, and iron ions are critical to the formation of hemoglobin. There are additional trace minerals that are still important to the body’s functions, but their required quantities are much lower.

Like vitamins, minerals can be consumed in toxic quantities (although it is rare). A healthy diet includes most of the minerals your body requires, so supplements and processed foods can add potentially toxic levels of minerals.  and  provide a summary of minerals and their function in the body.

| Calcium | Dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables, blackstrap molasses, nuts, brewer’s yeast, some fish | 1000 mg | Bone structure and health; nerve and muscle functions, especially cardiac function | Slow growth, weak and brittle bones |
| Phosphorous | Meat, milk | 700 mg | Bone formation, metabolism, ATP production | Rare |
| Magnesium | Whole grains, nuts, leafy green vegetables | 310–420 mg | Enzyme activation, production of energy, regulation of other nutrients | Agitation, anxiety, sleep problems, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, low blood pressure, muscular problems |
| Chloride | Most foods, salt, vegetables, especially seaweed, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, olives | 2300 mg | Balance of body fluids, digestion | Loss of appetite, muscle cramps |
