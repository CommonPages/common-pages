name: Urea Cycle

The  **urea cycle** is a set of biochemical reactions that produces urea from ammonium ions in order to prevent a toxic level of ammonium in the body. It occurs primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Prior to the urea cycle, ammonium ions are produced from the breakdown of amino acids. In these reactions, an amine group, or ammonium ion, from the amino acid is exchanged with a keto group on another molecule. This  **transamination** event creates a molecule that is necessary for the Krebs cycle and an ammonium ion that enters into the urea cycle to be eliminated.

In the urea cycle, ammonium is combined with CO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in urea and water. The urea is eliminated through the kidneys in the urine ({'Figure_25_4_2 Figure 25.4.2}).

Amino acids can also be used as a source of energy, especially in times of starvation. Because the processing of amino acids results in the creation of metabolic intermediates, including pyruvate, acetyl CoA, acetoacyl CoA, oxaloacetate, and Î±-ketoglutarate, amino acids can serve as a source of energy production through the Krebs cycle ({'Figure_25_4_3 Figure 25.4.3}). {'Figure_25_4_4 Figure 25.4.4} summarizes the pathways of catabolism and anabolism for carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.
