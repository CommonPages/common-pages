# Respiratory Acidosis: Primary Carbonic Acid/CO<sub>2</sub> Excess

 **Respiratory acidosis** occurs when the blood is overly acidic due to an excess of carbonic acid, resulting from too much CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood. Respiratory acidosis can result from anything that interferes with respiration, such as pneumonia, emphysema, or congestive heart failure.
