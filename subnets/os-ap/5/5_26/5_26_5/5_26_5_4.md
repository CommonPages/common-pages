# Respiratory Alkalosis: Primary Carbonic Acid/CO<sub>2 </sub>Deficiency

 **Respiratory alkalosis** occurs when the blood is overly alkaline due to a deficiency in carbonic acid and CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood. This condition usually occurs when too much CO<sub>2</sub> is exhaled from the lungs, as occurs in hyperventilation, which is breathing that is deeper or more frequent than normal. An elevated respiratory rate leading to hyperventilation can be due to extreme emotional upset or fear, fever, infections, hypoxia, or abnormally high levels of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Surprisingly, aspirin overdose—salicylate toxicity—can result in respiratory alkalosis as the body tries to compensate for initial acidosis.
