name: The Peritoneum

The digestive organs within the abdominal cavity are held in place by the peritoneum, a broad serous membranous sac made up of squamous epithelial tissue surrounded by connective tissue. It is composed of two different regions: the parietal peritoneum, which lines the abdominal wall, and the visceral peritoneum, which envelopes the abdominal organs ({'Figure_24_1_3 Figure 24.1.3}). The peritoneal cavity is the space bounded by the visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces. A few milliliters of watery fluid act as a lubricant to minimize friction between the serosal surfaces of the peritoneum.

The visceral peritoneum includes multiple large folds that envelope various abdominal organs, holding them to the dorsal surface of the body wall. Within these folds are blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves that innervate the organs with which they are in contact, supplying their adjacent organs. The five major peritoneal folds are described in . Note that during fetal development, certain digestive structures, including the first portion of the small intestine (called the duodenum), the pancreas, and portions of the large intestine (the ascending and descending colon, and the rectum) remain completely or partially posterior to the peritoneum. Thus, the location of these organs is described as  **retroperitoneal**.


****

| Fold | Description |
|:-:|:-:|
| Greater omentum | Apron-like structure that lies superficial to the small intestine and transverse colon; a site of fat deposition in people who are overweight |
| Falciform ligament | Anchors the liver to the anterior abdominal wall and inferior border of the diaphragm |
| Lesser omentum | Suspends the stomach from the inferior border of the liver; provides a pathway for structures connecting to the liver |
| Mesentery | Vertical band of tissue anterior to the lumbar vertebrae and anchoring all of the small intestine except the initial portion (the duodenum) |
| Mesocolon | Attaches two portions of the large intestine (the transverse and sigmoid colon) to the posterior abdominal wall |
