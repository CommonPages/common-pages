name: Chemical Digestion and Absorption: A Closer Look - Introduction

As you have learned, the process of mechanical digestion is relatively simple. It involves the physical breakdown of food but does not alter its chemical makeup. Chemical digestion, on the other hand, is a complex process that reduces food into its chemical building blocks, which are then absorbed to nourish the cells of the body ({'Figure_24_7_1 Figure 24.7.1}). In this section, you will look more closely at the processes of chemical digestion and absorption.
