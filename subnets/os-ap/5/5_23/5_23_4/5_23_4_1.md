There are four main regions in the  **stomach**: the cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus ({'Figure_24_4_1 Figure 24.4.1}). The  **cardia** (or cardiac region) is the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach and through which food passes into the stomach. Located inferior to the diaphragm, above and to the left of the cardia, is the dome-shaped  **fundus**. Below the fundus is the  **body**, the main part of the stomach. The funnel-shaped  **pylorus** connects the stomach to the duodenum. The wider end of the funnel, the  **pyloric antrum**, connects to the body of the stomach. The narrower end is called the  **pyloric canal**, which connects to the duodenum. The smooth muscle  **pyloric sphincter** is located at this latter point of connection and controls stomach emptying. In the absence of food, the stomach deflates inward, and its mucosa and submucosa fall into a large fold called a  **ruga**.

The convex lateral surface of the stomach is called the greater curvature; the concave medial border is the lesser curvature. The stomach is held in place by the lesser omentum, which extends from the liver to the lesser curvature, and the greater omentum, which runs from the greater curvature to the posterior abdominal wall.
