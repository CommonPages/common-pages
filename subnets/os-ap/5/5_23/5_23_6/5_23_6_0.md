name: Accessory Organs in Digestion: The Liver, Pancreas, and Gallbladder - Introduction

Chemical digestion in the small intestine relies on the activities of three accessory digestive organs: the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder ({'Figure_24_6_1 Figure 24.6.1}). The digestive role of the liver is to produce bile and export it to the duodenum. The gallbladder primarily stores, concentrates, and releases bile. The pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions, and delivers it to the duodenum.
