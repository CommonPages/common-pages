name: Digestive System Processes and Regulation - Introduction

The digestive system uses mechanical and chemical activities to break food down into absorbable substances during its journey through the digestive system.  provides an overview of the basic functions of the digestive organs.


****

| Organ | Major functions | Other functions |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Mouth |  Ingests food Chews and mixes food Begins chemical breakdown of carbohydrates Moves food into the pharynx Begins breakdown of lipids via lingual lipase |  Moistens and dissolves food, allowing you to taste it Cleans and lubricates the teeth and oral cavity Has some antimicrobial activity |
| Pharynx | Propels food from the oral cavity to the esophagus | Lubricates food and passageways |
| Esophagus | Propels food to the stomach | Lubricates food and passageways |
| Stomach |  Mixes and churns food with gastric juices to form chyme Begins chemical breakdown of proteins Releases food into the duodenum as chyme Absorbs some fat-soluble substances (for example, alcohol, aspirin) Possesses antimicrobial functions  |  Stimulates protein-digesting enzymes Secretes intrinsic factor required for vitamin B12 absorption in small intestine |
| Small intestine |  Mixes chyme with digestive juices Propels food at a rate slow enough for digestion and absorption Absorbs breakdown products of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, along with vitamins, minerals, and water Performs physical digestion via segmentation | Provides optimal medium for enzymatic activity |
| Accessory organs |  Liver: produces bile salts, which emulsify lipids, aiding their digestion and absorption Gallbladder: stores, concentrates, and releases bile Pancreas: produces digestive enzymes and bicarbonate |   Bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juices help neutralize acidic chyme and provide optimal environment for enzymatic activity  |
| Large intestine |  Further breaks down food residues Absorbs most residual water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by enteric bacteria Propels feces toward rectum Eliminates feces |  Food residue is concentrated and temporarily stored prior to defecation Mucus eases passage of feces through colon |
