name: Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System - Introduction

The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance. Portions of the respiratory system are also used for non-vital functions, such as sensing odors, speech production, and for straining, such as during childbirth or coughing ({'Figure_23_1_1 Figure 23.1.1}).

Functionally, the respiratory system can be divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone. The  **conducting zone** of the respiratory system includes the organs and structures not directly involved in gas exchange. The gas exchange occurs in the  **respiratory zone**.
