name: The Process of Breathing - Introduction

 **Pulmonary ventilation** is the act of breathing, which can be described as the movement of air into and out of the lungs. The major mechanisms that drive pulmonary ventilation are atmospheric pressure ( *P*<sub>atm</sub>); the air pressure within the alveoli, called intra-alveolar pressure ( *P*<sub>alv</sub>); and the pressure within the pleural cavity, called intrapleural pressure ( *P*<sub>ip</sub>).
