name: Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System - Introduction

The female reproductive system functions to produce gametes and reproductive hormones, just like the male reproductive system; however, it also has the additional task of supporting the developing fetus and delivering it to the outside world. Unlike its male counterpart, the female reproductive system is located primarily inside the pelvic cavity ({'Figure_28_2_1 Figure 28.2.1}). Recall that the ovaries are the female gonads. The gamete they produce is called an  **oocyte**. We’ll discuss the production of oocytes in detail shortly. First, let’s look at some of the structures of the female reproductive system.
