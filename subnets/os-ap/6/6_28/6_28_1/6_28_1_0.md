name: Fertilization - Introduction

 **Fertilization** occurs when a sperm and an oocyte (egg) combine and their nuclei fuse. Because each of these reproductive cells is a haploid cell containing half of the genetic material needed to form a human being, their combination forms a diploid cell. This new single cell, called a  **zygote**, contains all of the genetic material needed to form a humanâ€”half from the mother and half from the father.
