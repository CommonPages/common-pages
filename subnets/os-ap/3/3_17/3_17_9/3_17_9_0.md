name: The Endocrine Pancreas - Introduction

The  **pancreas** is a long, slender organ, most of which is located posterior to the bottom half of the stomach ({'Figure_18_9_1 Figure 18.9.1}). Although it is primarily an exocrine gland, secreting a variety of digestive enzymes, the pancreas has an endocrine function. Its  **pancreatic islets**—clusters of cells formerly known as the islets of Langerhans—secrete the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).
