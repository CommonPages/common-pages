name: Liver

The liver is responsible for secreting at least four important hormones or hormone precursors: insulin-like growth factor (somatomedin), angiotensinogen, thrombopoetin, and hepcidin. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is the immediate stimulus for growth in the body, especially of the bones. Angiotensinogen is the precursor to angiotensin, mentioned earlier, which increases blood pressure. Thrombopoetin stimulates the production of the bloodâ€™s platelets. Hepcidins block the release of iron from cells in the body, helping to regulate iron homeostasis in our body fluids. The major hormones of these other organs are summarized in .


****

| Organ | Major hormones | Effects |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Heart | Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) | Reduces blood volume, blood pressure, and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration |
| Gastrointestinal tract | Gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin | Aid digestion of food and buffering of stomach acids |
| Gastrointestinal tract | Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) | Stimulate beta cells of the pancreas to release insulin |
| Kidneys | Renin | Stimulates release of aldosterone |
| Kidneys | Calcitriol | Aids in the absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sup></sup> |
| Kidneys | Erythropoietin | Triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow |
| Skeleton | FGF23 | Inhibits production of calcitriol and increases phosphate excretion |
| Skeleton | Osteocalcin | Increases insulin production |
| Adipose tissue | Leptin | Promotes satiety signals in the brain |
| Adipose tissue | Adiponectin | Reduces insulin resistance |
| Skin | Cholecalciferol | Modified to form vitamin D |
| Thymus (and other organs) | Thymosins | Among other things, aids in the development of T lymphocytes of the immune system |
| Liver | Insulin-like growth factor-1 | Stimulates bodily growth |
| Liver | Angiotensinogen | Raises blood pressure |
| Liver | Thrombopoetin | Causes increase in platelets |
| Liver | Hepcidin | Blocks release of iron into body fluids |
