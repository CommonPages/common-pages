name: Heart

When the body experiences an increase in blood volume or pressure, the cells of the heartâ€™s atrial wall stretch. In response, specialized cells in the wall of the atria produce and secrete the peptide hormone  **atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)**. ANP signals the kidneys to reduce sodium reabsorption, thereby decreasing the amount of water reabsorbed from the urine filtrate and reducing blood volume. Other actions of ANP include the inhibition of renin secretion, thus inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and vasodilation. Therefore, ANP aids in decreasing blood pressure, blood volume, and blood sodium levels.
