name: Regulation of TH Synthesis

The release of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> from the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). As shown in {'Figure_18_4_2 Figure 18.4.2}, low blood levels of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> stimulate the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus, which triggers secretion of TSH from the anterior pituitary. In turn, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>. The levels of TRH, TSH, T<sub>3</sub>, and T<sub>4</sub> are regulated by a negative feedback system in which increasing levels of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> decrease the production and secretion of TSH.
