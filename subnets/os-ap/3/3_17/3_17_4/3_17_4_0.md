name: The Thyroid Gland - Introduction

A butterfly-shaped organ, the  **thyroid gland** is located anterior to the trachea, just inferior to the larynx ({'Figure_18_4_1 Figure 18.4.1}). The medial region, called the isthmus, is flanked by wing-shaped left and right lobes. Each of the thyroid lobes are embedded with parathyroid glands, primarily on their posterior surfaces. The tissue of the thyroid gland is composed mostly of thyroid follicles. The follicles are made up of a central cavity filled with a sticky fluid called  **colloid**. Surrounded by a wall of epithelial follicle cells, the colloid is the center of thyroid hormone production, and that production is dependent on the hormonesâ€™ essential and unique component: iodine.
