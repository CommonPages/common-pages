name: Primary Vesicles

As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the production of sac-like vesicles. Similar to a child’s balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins to take on a new shape. Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are called  **primary vesicles**. These vesicles are given names that are based on Greek words, the main root word being  *enkephalon*, which means “brain” (en- = “inside”; kephalon = “head”). The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the developing nervous system.

The  **prosencephalon** (pros- = “in front”) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean  **forebrain**. The  **mesencephalon** (mes- = “middle”) is the next vesicle, which can be called the  **midbrain**. The third vesicle at this stage is the  **rhombencephalon**. The first part of this word is also the root of the word rhombus, which is a geometrical figure with four sides of equal length (a square is a rhombus with 90° angles). Whereas prosencephalon and mesencephalon translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for “four-sided-figure-brain.” However, the third vesicle can be called the  **hindbrain**. One way of thinking about how the brain is arranged is to use these three regions—forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain—which are based on the primary vesicle stage of development ({'Figure_13_1_2 Figure 13.1.2} **a**).
