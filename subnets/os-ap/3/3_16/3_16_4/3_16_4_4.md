name: Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage

Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to the motor system is in the upper or lower motor neurons. Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness, strong deep tendon reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign,  **spasticity**, and the  **clasp-knife response**. Spasticity is an excess contraction in resistance to stretch. It can result in  **hyperflexia**, which is when joints are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially resists movement, but then releases, and the joint will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.

A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as  **paresis**. The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred to as  **flaccid paralysis**, referring to a complete or partial loss of muscle tone, in contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained and spasticity is exhibited. Other signs of an LMN lesion are  **fibrillation**,  **fasciculation**, and compromised or lost reflexes resulting from the denervation of the muscle fibers.
