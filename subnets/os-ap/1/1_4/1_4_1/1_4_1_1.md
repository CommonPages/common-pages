name: The Four Types of Tissues

 **Epithelial tissue**, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body, lines internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands.  **Connective tissue**, as its name implies, binds the cells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the body.  **Muscle tissue** is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as three major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart.  **Nervous tissue** is also excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate between different regions of the body ({'Figure_4_1_1 Figure 4.1.1}).

The next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just as knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you understand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle and nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.
