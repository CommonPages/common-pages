name: Embryonic Connective Tissue

All connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (see {'Figure_4_1_2 Figure 4.1.2}). The first connective tissue to develop in the embryo is  **mesenchyme**, the stem cell line from which all connective tissues are later derived. Clusters of mesenchymal cells are scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for replacement and repair after a connective tissue injury. A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord, called  **mucous connective tissue** or Whartonâ€™s jelly. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only scattered mesenchymal cells throughout the body.
