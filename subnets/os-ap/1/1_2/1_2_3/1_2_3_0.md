name: Chemical Reactions - Introduction

One characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go on to maintain that organismâ€™s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic chemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism can proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules break, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of energy.
