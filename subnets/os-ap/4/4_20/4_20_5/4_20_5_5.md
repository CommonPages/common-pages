name: Arteries Serving the Lower Limbs

The external iliac artery exits the body cavity and enters the femoral region of the lower leg ({'Figure_21_5_12 Figure 21.5.12}). As it passes through the body wall, it is renamed the  **femoral artery**. It gives off several smaller branches as well as the lateral  **deep femoral artery** that in turn gives rise to a  **lateral circumflex artery**. These arteries supply blood to the deep muscles of the thigh as well as ventral and lateral regions of the integument. The femoral artery also gives rise to the  **genicular artery**, which provides blood to the region of the knee. As the femoral artery passes posterior to the knee near the popliteal fossa, it is called the popliteal artery. The  **popliteal artery** branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.

The  **anterior tibial artery** is located between the tibia and fibula, and supplies blood to the muscles and integument of the anterior tibial region. Upon reaching the tarsal region, it becomes the  **dorsalis pedis artery**, which branches repeatedly and provides blood to the tarsal and dorsal regions of the foot. The  **posterior tibial artery** provides blood to the muscles and integument on the posterior surface of the tibial region. The fibular or peroneal artery branches from the posterior tibial artery. It bifurcates and becomes the  **medial plantar artery** and  **lateral plantar artery**, providing blood to the plantar surfaces. There is an anastomosis with the dorsalis pedis artery, and the medial and lateral plantar arteries form two arches called the  **dorsal arch** (also called the arcuate arch) and the  **plantar arch**, which provide blood to the remainder of the foot and toes. {'Figure_21_5_13 Figure 21.5.13} shows the distribution of the major systemic arteries in the lower limb.  summarizes the major systemic arteries discussed in the text.

| Vessel | Description |
|:-:|:-:|
| Femoral artery | Continuation of the external iliac artery after it passes through the body cavity; divides into several smaller branches, the lateral deep femoral artery, and the genicular artery; becomes the popliteal artery as it passes posterior to the knee |
| Deep femoral artery | Branch of the femoral artery; gives rise to the lateral circumflex arteries |
| Lateral circumflex artery | Branch of the deep femoral artery; supplies blood to the deep muscles of the thigh and the ventral and lateral regions of the integument |
| Genicular artery | Branch of the femoral artery; supplies blood to the region of the knee |
| Popliteal artery | Continuation of the femoral artery posterior to the knee; branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries |
| Anterior tibial artery | Branches from the popliteal artery; supplies blood to the anterior tibial region; becomes the dorsalis pedis artery |
| Dorsalis pedis artery | Forms from the anterior tibial artery; branches repeatedly to supply blood to the tarsal and dorsal regions of the foot |
| Posterior tibial artery | Branches from the popliteal artery and gives rise to the fibular or peroneal artery; supplies blood to the posterior tibial region |
| Medial plantar artery | Arises from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial arteries; supplies blood to the medial plantar surfaces of the foot |
| Lateral plantar artery | Arises from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial arteries; supplies blood to the lateral plantar surfaces of the foot |
| Dorsal or arcuate arch | Formed from the anastomosis of the dorsalis pedis artery and the medial and plantar arteries; branches supply the distal portions of the foot and digits |
| Plantar arch | Formed from the anastomosis of the dorsalis pedis artery and the medial and plantar arteries; branches supply the distal portions of the foot and digits |
