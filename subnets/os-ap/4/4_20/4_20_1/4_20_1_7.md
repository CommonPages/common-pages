name: Veins

A  **vein** is a blood vessel that conducts blood toward the heart. Compared to arteries, veins are thin-walled vessels with large and irregular lumens (see {'Figure_21_1_6 Figure 21.1.6}). Because they are low-pressure vessels, larger veins are commonly equipped with valves that promote the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart and prevent backflow toward the capillaries caused by the inherent low blood pressure in veins as well as the pull of gravity.  compares the features of arteries and veins.

****

|  | Arteries | Veins |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  **Direction of blood flow** | Conducts blood away from the heart | Conducts blood toward the heart |
|  **General appearance** | Rounded | Irregular, often collapsed |
|  **Pressure** | High | Low |
|  **Wall thickness** | Thick | Thin |
|  **Relative oxygen concentration** |  Higher in systemic arteries <br />Lower in pulmonary arteries |  Lower in systemic veins <br />Higher in pulmonary veins  |
|  **Valves** | Not present | Present most commonly in limbs and in veins inferior to the heart |
