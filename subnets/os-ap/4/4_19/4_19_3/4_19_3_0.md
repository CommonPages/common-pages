name: Cardiac Cycle - Introduction

The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the  **cardiac cycle** ({'Figure_20_3_1 Figure 20.3.1}). The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called  **systole**. The period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called  **diastole**. Both the atria and ventricles undergo systole and diastole, and it is essential that these components be carefully regulated and coordinated to ensure blood is pumped efficiently to the body.
