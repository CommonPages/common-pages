name: Determining ABO Blood Types

Clinicians are able to determine a patientâ€™s blood type quickly and easily using commercially prepared antibodies. An unknown blood sample is allocated into separate wells. Into one well a small amount of anti-A antibody is added, and to another a small amount of anti-B antibody. If the antigen is present, the antibodies will cause visible agglutination of the cells ({'Figure_19_6_2 Figure 19.6.2}). The blood should also be tested for Rh antibodies.
