name: An Overview of Blood - Introduction

Recall that  **blood** is a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an extracellular matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as the  **formed elements**—include  **red blood cells (RBCs)**,  **white blood cells (WBCs)**, and cell fragments called  **platelets**. The extracellular matrix, called  **plasma**, makes blood unique among connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.
