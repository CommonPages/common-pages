name: Disorders of Platelets

 **Thrombocytosis** is a condition in which there are too many platelets. This may trigger formation of unwanted blood clots (thrombosis), a potentially fatal disorder. If there is an insufficient number of platelets, called  **thrombocytopenia**, blood may not clot properly, and excessive bleeding may result.
