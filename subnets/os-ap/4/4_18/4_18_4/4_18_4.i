    The  **leukocyte**, commonly known as a white blood cell (or WBC), is a major component of the bodyâ€™s defenses against disease. Leukocytes protect the body against invading microorganisms and body cells with mutated DNA, and they clean up debris. Platelets are essential for the repair of blood vessels when damage to them has occurred; they also provide growth factors for healing and repair. See {'Figure_19_3_1 Figure 19.3.1} for a summary of leukocytes and platelets.
