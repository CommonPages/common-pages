  # What is biological therapy?

  >>>
    Biological therapy involves the use of living organisms, substances derived from living organisms, or laboratory-produced versions of such substances to treat disease. Some biological therapies for cancer stimulate the body’s immune system to act against cancer cells. These types of biological therapy, which are sometimes referred to collectively as “immunotherapy,” do not target cancer cells directly. Other biological therapies, such as antibodies, do target cancer cells directly. Biological therapies that interfere with specific molecules involved in tumor growth and progression are also referred to as targeted therapies. (For more information, see Targeted Cancer Therapies.)

    For patients with cancer, biological therapies may be used to treat the cancer itself or the side effects of other cancer treatments. Although many forms of biological therapy have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), others remain experimental and are available to cancer patients principally through participation in clinical trials (research studies involving people).

  >>> What is the immune system?

    The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and the substances they make. It helps the body fight infections and other diseases.

    - White blood cells, or leukocytes, play the main role in immune responses. These cells carry out the many tasks required to protect the body against disease-causing microbes and abnormal cells.
    - Some types of leukocytes patrol the circulatory system, seeking foreign invaders, such as microbes and pathogens, and diseased, damaged, or dead cells. These white blood cells provide a general—or nonspecific—type of immune protection.
    - Other types of leukocytes, known as lymphocytes, provide targeted protection against specific threats, whether from a specific microbe or a diseased or abnormal cell. The most important groups of lymphocytes responsible for these specific immune responses are B cells and T cells.
      - B cells make antibodies, which are large, secreted proteins that bind to and help destroy foreign invaders or abnormal cells.
      - Killer T cells, which are also known as cytotoxic T cells, kill infected or abnormal cells by releasing toxic chemicals or by prompting the cells to self-destruct (in a process known as apoptosis).
    - Other types of lymphocytes and leukocytes play supporting roles to ensure that B cells and killer T cells do their jobs effectively. These supporting cells include helper T cells and dendritic cells, which help activate both B cells and killer T cells and enable them to respond to specific threats from a microbe or a diseased or abnormal cell.

    Antigens are substances on the body’s own cells and on microbes that can be recognized by the immune system. Normal cells in the body have antigens that identify them as “self.” Self antigens tell the immune system that normal cells are not a threat and should be ignored. In contrast, microbes are recognized by the immune system as a potential threat that should be destroyed because they carry foreign, or non-self, antigens. Cancer cells also often contain antigens, called tumor antigens, that are not present (or are present at lower levels) on normal cells.

  >>> Can the immune system attack cancer?

    The natural ability of the immune system to detect and destroy abnormal cells likely prevents or suppresses the development of many cancers. Immune cells are sometimes found in and around tumors. These cells, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, are an indication that the immune system is responding to the tumor. The presence of TILs in a patient’s tumor is often associated with a better outcome in the patient.

    However, cancer cells have various ways to evade detection and destruction by the immune system. For example, cancer cells can:

    Undergo genetic changes that cause them to reduce the expression of tumor antigens on their surface, making them less “visible” to the immune system
    Have proteins on their surface that inactivate immune cells
    Induce normal cells around the tumor (i.e, in the tumor microenvironment) to release substances that suppress immune responses and that promote tumor cell proliferation and survival.
    Immunotherapy uses various approaches to strengthen the immune system and/or help it surmount the cancer’s defenses against the immune system. The goal is to improve the ability of the immune system to detect and destroy cancer.

  >>> What types of biological therapy are used to treat cancer?
    Several types of biological therapies, especially immunotherapies, are being used or developed for cancer treatment. These therapies fight cancer in different ways.

  >>> What are the side effects of biological therapies?

    The side effects of biological therapies mainly reflect the stimulation of the immune system and can differ by the type of therapy and by how individual patients react to it.

    Pain, swelling, soreness, redness, itchiness, and rash at the site of infusion or injection are fairly common with these treatments. They can also cause an array of flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, weakness, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, muscle or joint aches, fatigue, headache, occasional breathing difficulties, and lowered or heightened blood pressure. Some immunotherapies that provoke an immune system response also pose a risk of severe or even fatal hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions.

    Long-term side effects of immunotherapies (particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors) include autoimmune syndromes and acute-onset diabetes.

    Potentially serious side effects of specific immunotherapies include:

    ##### Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

    - Organ-damaging immune-mediated reactions involving the digestive system, liver, skin, nervous system, and heart and in the hormone-producing glands. These reactions can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis and renal (kidney) dysfunction, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), and hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

    ##### Immune Cell Therapy
    - Cytokine release syndrome (CAR T-cell therapy)
    - Capillary leak syndrome (TIL therapy)

    ##### Therapeutic Antibodies and Other Immune System Molecules
    - Cytokine release syndrome (blinatumomab)
    - Infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and loss of visual acuity (denileukin diftitox)

    ##### Therapeutic Vaccines
    - Flu-like symptoms
    - Severe allergic reaction
    - Stroke (Sipuleucel-T)
    - Tumor lysis syndrome, herpes virus infection (T-VEC)

    ##### Immune System Modulators
    - Flu-like symptoms, severe allergic reaction, lowered blood counts, changes in blood chemistry, organ damage (cytokines)
    - Flu-like symptoms, severe allergic reaction, urinary side effects (BCG)
    - Severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy, blood clots/venous embolism, neuropathy (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide)
    - Skin reactions (imiquimod)

  >>> What is the ongoing research on cancer immunotherapy?

    Researchers are focusing on several major areas to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, including:

    - Approaches to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Researchers are testing combinations of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with a wide range of other immunotherapies, molecularly targeted cancer therapies, and radiation therapy, as ways to overcome therapeutic resistance of tumors to immunotherapy (5, 6).

    - Identification of biomarkers that predict response to immunotherapy. Not everyone who receives immunotherapy will respond to the treatment. Identification of biomarkers that predict response is a major area of research (7, 8).

    {embed:'7}

    {embed:'8}

    - Identification of novel cancer-associated antigens—so-called neoantigens—that may be more effective in stimulating immune responses than the already known antigens (9, 10).

    {embed:'9}

    {embed:'10}

    - Noninvasive strategies to isolate neoantigen-expressing tumor-reactive immune cells (11).

    {embed:'11}

    - Learning more about the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade or suppress anticancer immune responses. A better understanding of how cancer cells manipulate the immune system could lead to the development of drugs that block those processes.
    - Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy. This approach uses infrared light to activate the targeted destruction of cancer cells in the body (12–14).

  >>> Where can I find information about clinical trials of immunotherapies?

    Both FDA-approved and experimental immunotherapies for specific types of cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Descriptions of ongoing clinical trials that are testing types of immunotherapies in cancer patients can be accessed by searching NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials on the NCI website. NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials includes all NCI-supported clinical trials that are taking place across the United States and Canada, including the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. For information about other ways to search the list, see Help Finding NCI-Supported Clinical Trials.

    Alternatively, call NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) for information about clinical trials of immunotherapies.
