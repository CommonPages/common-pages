  >>> How they work
    Cancer treatment vaccines are designed to treat cancers that have already developed by strengthening the body’s natural defenses against the cancer. They are intended to delay or stop cancer cell growth; to cause tumor shrinkage; to prevent cancer from coming back; or to eliminate cancer cells that have not been killed by other forms of treatment.

    The idea behind cancer treatment vaccines is that introducing one or more cancer antigens into the body will cause an immune response that ultimately kills the cancer cells.

    Cancer treatment vaccines may be made from a patient’s own tumor cells (that is, they are customized so that they mount an immune response against features that are unique to a specific patient’s tumor), or they may be made from substances (antigens) that are produced by certain types of tumors (that is, they mount an immune response in any patient whose tumor produces the antigen).

    The first FDA-approved cancer treatment vaccine, sipuleucel-T (Provenge®), is customized to each patient. It was designed to stimulate an immune response to prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), an antigen that is found on most prostate cancer cells. The vaccine is created by isolating immune system cells called dendritic cells, which are a type of antigen-presenting cell (APC), from a patient’s blood. These cells are sent to the vaccine manufacturer, where they are cultured in the laboratory together with a protein called PAP-GM-CSF. This protein consists of PAP linked to a protein called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which stimulates the immune system and enhances antigen presentation.

    Antigen-presenting cells cultured with PAP-GM-CSF are the active component of sipuleucel-T. These cells are infused into the patient. Although the precise mechanism of action of sipuleucel-T is not known, it appears that the antigen-presenting cells that have taken up PAP-GM-CSF stimulate T cells of the immune system to kill tumor cells that express PAP.

    The first FDA-approved oncolytic virus therapy, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC, or Imlygic®), is also considered a type of vaccine. It is based on herpes simplex virus type 1 and includes a gene that codes for GM-CSF. Although this oncolytic virus can infect both cancer and normal cells, normal cells have mechanisms to kill the virus whereas cancer cells do not. T-VEC is injected directly into a tumor. As the virus replicates, it causes cancer cells to burst and die. The dying cells release new viruses, GM-CSF, and a variety of tumor-specific antigens that can stimulate an immune response against cancer cells throughout the body.

  >>> How they are used
    Sipuleucel-T is used to treat prostate cancer that has metastasized in men who have few or no symptoms and whose cancer is hormone refractory (does not respond to hormone treatment). T-VEC is used to treat some patients with metastatic melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.
