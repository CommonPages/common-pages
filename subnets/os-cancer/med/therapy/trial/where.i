    Cancer clinical trials take place in cities and towns across the United States and throughout the world. They take place in doctors’ offices, cancer centers, medical centers, community hospitals and clinics, and veterans’ and military hospitals. A single trial may take place in one or two places, or at hundreds of different sites.

    You can search for clinical trials by using the Cancer.gov [clinical trials search form](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search).  This form helps you find NCI-supported clinical trials that are taking place across the United States, Canada, and internationally. The list includes:

    - All NCI network trials, including trials supported through the:
      - [National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)](https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/clinical-trials/nctn)
      - [NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)](https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/clinical-trials/ncorp)
      - [Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN)](http://ctep.cancer.gov/initiativesPrograms/etctn.htm)
    - Trials that are funded in full or in part by NCI, including trials taking place at [NCI-designated cancer centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers)
    - Trials at the [NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/what-are-trials/where/clinical-center)

    When you talk with your doctor about treatment options, ask about clinical trials. There may be one that is right for you taking place at your doctor’s office or nearby cancer center.
