  # A bone scan or bone scintigraphy /sɪnˈtɪɡrəfi/ is a nuclear medicine imaging technique of the bone. It can help diagnose a number of bone conditions, including cancer of the bone or metastasis, location of bone inflammation and fractures (that may not be visible in traditional X-ray images), and bone infection(ostemyelytis).[1]

    A bone scan is a very specific test that may be used to determine if cancer has spread to the bones. Again, with this test, the radiology technician will inject a small amount of sugar water with a radioactive isotope solution into your vein. This fluid begins to accumulate in areas of abnormal bone growth where a radiation scanner can measure the radioactivity levels and record them on x-ray film providing a clear picture of areas that might have cancerous tumors.
