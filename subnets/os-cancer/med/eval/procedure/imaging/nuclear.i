/ Nuclear Scan
/// During a nuclear scan, patients are injected with a small amount of radioactive material called a tracer which flows through the bloodstream and collects in certain bones or organs. A machine called a scanner detects and measures the radioactivity. The scanner creates pictures of bones or organs.

    Nuclear scans use radioactive substances to see structures and functions inside your body. They use a special camera that detects radioactivity.

    Before the test, you receive a small amount of radioactive material. You may get it as an injection. Sometimes you swallow it or inhale it. Then you lie still on a table while the camera makes images. Most scans take 20 to 45 minutes.

    Nuclear scans can help doctors diagnose many conditions, including cancers, injuries, and infections. They can also show how organs like your heart and lungs are working.
