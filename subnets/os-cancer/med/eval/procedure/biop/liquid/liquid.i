    A test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells from a tumor that are circulating in the blood or for pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are in the blood. A liquid biopsy may be used to help find cancer at an early stage. It may also be used to help plan treatment or to find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Being able to take multiple samples of blood over time may also help doctors understand what kind of molecular changes are taking place in a tumor.

    Fortunately, there are “liquid biopsy tests” available that use various technologies so that you can get complete genomic testing with simple blood test. The GeneStrat® blood-based genomic test from Biodesix provides actionable mutations that can direct the use of targeted therapy in 72 hours. Another method, used by the Guardant360 test, is likely to find a mutation that drives your cancer in lung adenocarcinoma in all but about 1⁄4 of patients. When you are initially diagnosed there is rarely more than one driver mutation found. Some are targetable and many are not, but if any driving mutation is found then there is no need to repeat an invasive biopsy.

    If your cancer has been treated with a targeted therapy but has progressed, a liquid biopsy may be used initially instead of repeating an invasive biopsy. The results typically come back in 3-14 days, depending on the test utilized, and if the blood test does not detect the new mutations driving your cancer, then your doctor may recommend a repeat invasive tissue biopsy.
