The TNM system helps describe cancer in great detail. But, for many cancers, the TNM combinations are grouped into five less-detailed stages. When talking about your cancer, your doctor or nurse may describe it as one of these stages:

<table class="table-default">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>What it means</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 0</td>
<td>Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III</td>
<td>Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage IV</td>
<td>The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.</td>
</tr>
