The authors believe that the complexity of cancer can be reduced to a small number of underlying principles. The paper argues that all cancers share six common traits ("hallmarks") that govern the transformation of normal cells to cancer (malignant or tumor) cells.

The traits that the authors highlight in the paper are:
  1. Cancer cells stimulate their own growth.
  2. They resist inhibitory signals that might otherwise stop their growth
  3. They resist their programmed cell death.
  4. They can multiply indefinitely.
  5. They stimulate the growth of blood vessels to supply nutrients to tumors.
  6. They invade local tissue and spread to distant sites.

In an update published in 2011, Weinberg and Hanahan proposed two new hallmarks (abnormal metabolic pathways, and evasion of the immune system) and two enabling characteristics (genome instability and inflammation).
