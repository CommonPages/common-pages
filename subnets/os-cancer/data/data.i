    # Cancer informatics is where information science, computer science and health care intersect. Itâ€™s about acquiring, storing and using information about cancer most thoroughly and efficiently.
    # One key facet of cancer informatics is cancer surveillance informatics, the gathering and synthesizing of data about cancer in ways such as analyzing captured data, gathering evidence from clinical trials, applying information into clinical practice, evaluating outcomes of changes in clinical practice, and generating new hypotheses for investigation.
    # The National Cancer Institute is at the center of developments in the field, through its National Cancer Informatics Program. Among its key programs is the NCIP Hub (nciphub.org). The hub aims to foster scientific collaboration, and to allow physicians and researchers to share resources. Content includes seminar presentations, publications, training materials, tools, and bookmarks to useful sites and information, as well as discussions about the information.
