  /// A neoplasm is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue.
  model Neoplasm
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm

    # This abnormal growth usually (but not always) forms a mass.[4] When it forms a mass, it may be called a tumor.
    # ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior.[5] Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers and are the focus of oncology.

  /// In current English, both medical and non-medical, <em>tumor</em> is used as a synonym for a neoplasm. The terms <em>mass</em> and <em>nodule</em> are often used synonymously with tumor.

    >>>
      Tumor (American English) or tumour (British English), Latin for swelling, one of the cardinal signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of swelling, neoplastic or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses tumor as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic lesion that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size. Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include leukemia and most forms of carcinoma in situ. Tumor is also not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, precancerous, or malignant.

      The terms mass and nodule are often used synonymously with tumor. Generally speaking, however, the term tumor is used generically, without reference to the physical size of the lesion. More specifically, the term mass is often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters (mm) in greatest direction, while the term nodule is usually used when the size of the lesion is less than 20 mm in its greatest dimension (25.4 mm = 1 inch).

      A person whose condition is in complete remission might be considered cured or recovered, notwithstanding the possibility of a relapse, i.e. the reappearance of a disease. In cancer-treatment, doctors usually avoid the term "cured" and instead prefer the term "no evidence of disease" or NED to refer to a complete remission of cancer, which does not necessarily mean that the cancer won't come back.
