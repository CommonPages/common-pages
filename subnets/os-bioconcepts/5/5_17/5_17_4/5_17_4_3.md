Immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune responses. Immunodeficiency increases an individual's susceptibility to infections and cancers. Hypersensitivities are misdirected responses either to harmless foreign particles, as in the case of allergies, or to the individualâ€™s own tissues, as in the case of autoimmunity. Reactions to self-components may be the result of molecular mimicry.
