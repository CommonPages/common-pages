name: Generating Another Energy Carrier: NADPH

The remaining function of the light-dependent reaction is to generate the other energy-carrier molecule, NADPH. As the electron from the electron transport chain arrives at photosystem I, it is re-energized with another photon captured by chlorophyll. The energy from this electron drives the formation of NADPH from NADP<sup>+</sup> and a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>). Now that the solar energy is stored in energy carriers, it can be used to make a sugar molecule.
