name: Water Is Polar

The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water molecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape seen in {'Figure_2_1_6 Figure 2.1.6}. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative charges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming hydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred to as  **hydrophilic** (“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and fats ({'Figure_2_2_1 Figure 2.2.1}). These nonpolar compounds are  **hydrophobic** (“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.
