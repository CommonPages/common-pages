name: Carbon Bonding

Carbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or molecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon atom ({'Figure_2_3_1 Figure 2.3.1}).

However, structures that are more complex are made using carbon. Any of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with another carbon atom covalently bonded to the first carbon atom. In this way, long and branching chains of carbon compounds can be made ({'Figure_2_3_2 Figure 2.3.2} **a**). The carbon atoms may bond with atoms of other elements, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus ({'Figure_2_3_2 Figure 2.3.2} **b**). The molecules may also form rings, which themselves can link with other rings ({'Figure_2_3_2 Figure 2.3.2} **c**). This diversity of molecular forms accounts for the diversity of functions of the biological macromolecules and is based to a large degree on the ability of carbon to form multiple bonds with itself and other atoms.
