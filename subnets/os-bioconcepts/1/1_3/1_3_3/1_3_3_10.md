name: Intercellular Junctions

Cells can also communicate with each other by direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this.  **Plasmodesmata** (singular = plasmodesma) are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight and gap junctions, and desmosomes.

In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are separated by the cell walls surrounding each cell. Plasmodesmata are numerous channels that pass between the cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connecting their cytoplasm and enabling signal molecules and nutrients to be transported from cell to cell ({'Figure_3_3_11abcd Figure 3.3.11abcd} **a**).

A  **tight junction** is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells ({'Figure_3_3_11abcd Figure 3.3.11abcd} **b**). Proteins hold the cells tightly against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the extracellular space.

Also found only in animal cells are  **desmosomes**, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ({'Figure_3_3_11abcd Figure 3.3.11abcd} **c**). They keep cells together in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles.

 **Gap junctions** in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate ({'Figure_3_3_11abcd Figure 3.3.11abcd} **d**). Structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.
