name: Savannas

 **Savannas** are grasslands with scattered trees, and they are found in Africa, South America, and northern Australia ({'Figure_20_3_1 Figure 20.3.1}). Savannas are hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24<sup>o</sup>C<sup> </sup>–29<sup>o</sup>C (75<sup>o</sup>F<sup> </sup>–84<sup>o</sup>F) and an annual rainfall of 51–127 cm (20–50 in). Savannas have an extensive dry season and consequent fires. As a result, scattered in the grasses and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) that dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees ({'Figure_20_3_3 Figure 20.3.3}). Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly re-sprout after a fire.
