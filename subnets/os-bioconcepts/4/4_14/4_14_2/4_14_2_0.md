name: Seedless Plants - Introduction

An incredible variety of seedless plants populates the terrestrial landscape. Mosses grow on tree trunks, and horsetails ({'Figure_14_2_1 Figure 14.2.1}) display their jointed stems and spindly leaves on the forest floor. Yet, seedless plants represent only a small fraction of the plants in our environment. Three hundred million years ago, seedless plants dominated the landscape and grew in the enormous swampy forests of the Carboniferous period. Their decomposing bodies created large deposits of coal that we mine today.
