name: Gene Flow

Another important evolutionary force is  **gene flow**, or the flow of alleles in and out of a population resulting from the migration of individuals or gametes ({'Figure_11_2_3 Figure 11.2.3}). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants, for example, send their seeds far and wide, by wind or in the guts of animals; these seeds may introduce alleles common in the source population to a new population in which they are rare.
