name: Fungal Diversity

The kingdom Fungi contains four major divisions that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction. Polyphyletic, unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, are placed for convenience in a fifth division, and a sixth major fungal group that does not fit well with any of the previous five has recently been described. Not all mycologists agree with this scheme. Rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA (a component of ribosomes) continue to reveal new and different relationships between the various categories of fungi.

The traditional divisions of Fungi are the  **Chytridiomycota** (chytrids), the  **Zygomycota** (conjugated fungi), the  **Ascomycota** (sac fungi), and the  **Basidiomycota** (club fungi).  An older classification scheme grouped fungi that strictly use asexual reproduction into Deuteromycota, a group that is no longer in use. The  **Glomeromycota** belong to a newly described group ({'Figure_13_4_5abcd Figure 13.4.5abcd}).
