name: Binary Fission

The cell division process of prokaryotes, called  **binary fission**, is a less complicated and much quicker process than cell division in eukaryotes. Because of the speed of bacterial cell division, populations of bacteria can grow very rapidly. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell. As in eukaryotes, the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to some of the proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.

The starting point of replication, the  **origin**, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane ({'Figure_6_4_1 Figure 6.4.1}). Replication of the DNA is bidirectionalâ€”moving away from the origin on both strands of the DNA loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell-wall attachment toward opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. A  **septum** is formed between the nucleoids from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.
