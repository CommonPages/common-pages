Prokaryotes have a single loop chromosome, whereas eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes consisting of two sets of 22 homologous chromosomes and a pair of nonhomologous sex chromosomes. This is the 2 *n,* or diploid, state. Human gametes have 23 chromosomes or one complete set of chromosomes. This is the  *n,* or haploid, state. Genes are segments of DNA that code for a specific protein or RNA molecule. An organismâ€™s traits are determined in large part by the genes inherited from each parent, but also by the environment that they experience.  Genes are expressed as characteristics of the organism and each characteristic may have different variants called traits that are caused by differences in the DNA sequence for a gene.
