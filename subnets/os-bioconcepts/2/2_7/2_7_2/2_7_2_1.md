name: Interphase

Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. The G<sub>1</sub> phase is the first phase of interphase and is focused on cell growth. In the S phase, the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated. Finally, in the G<sub>2</sub> phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.

During DNA duplication of the S phase, each chromosome becomes composed of two identical copies (called sister chromatids) that are held together at the centromere until they are pulled apart during meiosis II. In an animal cell, the centrosomes that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle also replicate. This prepares the cell for the first meiotic phase.
