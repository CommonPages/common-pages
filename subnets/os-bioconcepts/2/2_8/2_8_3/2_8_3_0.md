name: Extensions of the Laws of Inheritance - Introduction

Mendel studied traits with only one mode of inheritance in pea plants. The inheritance of the traits he studied all followed the relatively simple pattern of dominant and recessive alleles for a single characteristic. There are several important modes of inheritance, discovered after Mendelâ€™s work, that do not follow the dominant and recessive, single-gene model.
