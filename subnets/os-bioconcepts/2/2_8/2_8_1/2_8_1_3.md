Working with garden pea plants, Mendel found that crosses between parents that differed for one trait produced F<sub>1</sub> offspring that all expressed one parent’s traits. The traits that were visible in the F<sub>1</sub> generation are referred to as dominant, and traits that disappear in the F<sub>1</sub> generation are described as recessive. When the F<sub>1</sub> plants in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F<sub>2</sub> offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that traits were inherited as independent events.
