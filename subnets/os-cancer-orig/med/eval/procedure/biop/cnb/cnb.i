    Core Needle Biopsy is usually performed by an interventional radiologist or pulmonologist. This procedure is similar to the FNA, but the doctor can usually get a larger piece of tissue with core needle biopsy. Using this method, the pathologist will have enough tissue to determine the type of lung cancer and for molecular testing. The core needle biopsy is usually done with the aid of some sort of x-ray equipment to guide the needle to the exact location of the tumor. Again, before this procedure, the biopsy site (area that will be stuck by the needle) is numbed so the procedure should cause minimal discomfort.
