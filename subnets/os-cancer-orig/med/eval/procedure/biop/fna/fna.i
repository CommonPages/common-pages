    Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate lumps or masses. In this technique, a thin (23â€“25 gauge), hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells that, after being stained, will be examined under a microscope (biopsy). The sampling and biopsy considered together are called fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) or fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) (the latter to emphasize that any aspiration biopsy involves cytopathology, not histopathology). Fine-needle aspiration biopsies are very safe minor surgical procedures. Often, a major surgical (excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead, eliminating the need for hospitalization. In 1981, the first fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the United States was done at Maimonides Medical Center.[1] Today, this procedure is widely used in the diagnosis of cancer and inflammatory conditions.

    A needle aspiration biopsy is safer and less traumatic than an open surgical biopsy, and significant complications are usually rare, depending on the body site. Common complications include bruising and soreness. There is a risk, because the biopsy is very small (only a few cells), that the problematic cells will be missed, resulting in a false negative result. There is also a risk that the cells taken will not enable a definitive diagnosis.

    Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is usually performed by an interventional radiologist (a doctor who specializes in doing procedures using radiology) or pulmonologist (a doctor who specializes in lung disease). In this procedure, the doctor will insert a needle through the chest wall into the tumor. Cells from the tumor are pulled into the syringe and are then examined by a pathologist under a microscope. The pathologist is the doctor on your team who specializes in diagnosing disease by examining tissue and body fluids. The fine needle aspiration procedure is done with the help of a CT scanner, fluoroscopy (live x-ray images done using a fluoroscope) or MRI to guide the needle to the exact location of the tumor. Before this procedure, the biopsy site (area that will be stuck by the needle) is numbed so the procedure should not hurt.
