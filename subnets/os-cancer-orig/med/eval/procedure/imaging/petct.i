/// During a PET scan, patients receive an injection of a tracer. Then, a machine makes 3-D pictures that show where the tracer collects in the body. These scans show how organs and tissues are working.

    # Positron Emission Tomography Scan (PET Scan)
    # A PET scan is done by another very specialized machine that rotates around your body giving a three dimensional view of your body and allowing your doctors to see the differences between malignant and benign areas. Before the PET scan, a member of your healthcare team will inject a small amount of sugar water with radioactive isotopes into a vein. A radioactive isotope is an atom that emits radiation that can be “seen” by the radiological equipment. As the PET scanner rotates, it shows a picture of where the isotopes are deposited in the cells. Malignant tumors show up brighter in the scan because the cancer cells are more active and are using more of the sugar water mixture than normal cells do.
