    Molecular pathology is focused upon the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids.[15] Molecular pathology is multidisciplinary by nature and shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genetics. It is often applied in a context that is as much scientific as directly medical and encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression, and the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to particular disorders. The crossover between molecular pathology and epidemiology is represented by a related field "molecular pathological epidemiology". [16] Molecular pathology is commonly used in diagnosis of cancer and infectious diseases. Molecular Pathology is primarily used to detect cancers such as melanoma, brainstem glioma, brain tumors as well as many other types of cancer and infectious diseases.[17] Techniques are numerous but include quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), multiplex PCR, DNA microarray, in situ hybridization, DNA sequencing, antibody based immunofluorescence tissue assays, molecular profiling of pathogens, and analysis of bacterial genes for antimicrobial resistance.[18] Techniques used are based on analyzing samples of DNA and RNA. Pathology is widely used for gene therapy and disease diagnosis.[19]

    One of the goals of your treatment is to determine whether your tumor will respond to a particular drug or treatment. Historically, lung cancer was treated based only on type and stage with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cytotoxic means cell-killing and typically this chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cells. Chemotherapy may be very effective in some people, but because the cancer cells are not the only rapidly dividing cells, there are often side effects when blood cell producing cells or hair cells (which also rapidly divide) are killed. We are learning that different types of lung cancer have different genomic forms that we can identify through molecular testing. Identifying the specific genomic makeup of the tumor may allow your team to tailor your treatment plan to the specific tumor.

    ### What is molecular testing?

    Molecular testing, also called assays or profiles, can help your treatment team identify specific biomarkers that are in your tumor. Molecules contain biomarkers that determine how your cancer will respond to treatment. A biomarker (or biological marker) is a very distinctive substance that indicates a particular disease is present. Biomarkers can be proteins, genes, or other biological substances. Generally, a tissue biopsy is performed to obtain an ideal amount of your tumor tissue for testing. When the tumor is biopsied, your oncologist and pathologist will look for certain biomarkers that have been associated with lung cancer. A “liquid biopsy,” or blood-based test, can also be used to conduct biomarker testing non-invasively.

    The results of these tests determine your distinct ‘molecular fingerprint.’ Just as no two fingerprints are alike, neither are molecular fingerprints. The information contained in your unique molecular fingerprint gives your oncologist or treating physician insights into how to personalize your lung cancer treatment plan.

    Each time you have a biopsy, your doctor may order molecular testing on the tissue.

    When the pathologist identifies specific biomarkers, this may indicate a genetic mutation and/or fusion. A genetic mutation is anything that changes the structure of a gene. A genetic fusion is a gene that is formed when the genetic material from two previously separate genes are mixed or fused together to form a new cancer-causing gene. We are learning that there are certain genes that can work to produce or suppress lung cancers. When there are changes in the structure (or mutations) of these genes, lung cancer can be the result.

    #   Blood-based proteomic testing
    # If genetic sequencing is similar to the “script” of biology, then proteomics (the study of proteins) is the live video capturing biology in action. One of the advantages of proteomics is that cancer patient subgroups have been identified based on specific protein signatures expressed by the tumor cells or a patient’s immune response to the tumor. These protein signatures can be detected in the patient’s blood (no tissue biopsy needed) and can be used to help inform the patient’s treatment plan.
    # Biodesix Inc., is a molecular diagnostics company advancing the development of innovative blood-based tests in oncology to enable precision medicine. VeriStrat® proteomic testing measures a patient’s response to their tumor and the chronic elevation of proteins known to be associated with aggressive cancer.

      Blood-based mutation testing with Droplet DigitalTM PCR technology has many advantages as a genomic testing platform. Both DNA and RNA can be assessed from blood using this highly sensitive methodology. Another advantage to ddPCR testing is that each test is run separately on a small amount of blood, providing the information necessary for patient treatment. Perhaps the most important advantage over other testing platforms, such as NGS, is the rapid turn-around time provided by ddPCR technology. Companies that provide ddPCR-based testing are often able to produce test results within 3-5 days of receiving a sample. Biodesix, Inc., provides GeneStrat mutation results within 72 hours.

      Genomic testing or profiling identifies the underlying DNA alterations that are driving the tumor’s growth. This information may help physicians understand which targeted treatment options are available for a patient based on their tumor’s unique genomic profile. A new technology called next-generation sequencing (NGS) is often referenced in relation to molecular or genomic testing for lung cancer. NGS is a tool for sequencing large amounts of DNA accurately in a short period of time, but it can be applied in many different ways.

      Standard genomic testing examines only one or a limited set of cancer-related genes and does not provide a complete picture. Some tests may use NGS to look for a few types of alterations in predetermined “hotspot” regions within genes where alterations more commonly occur. However, tumors often contain multiple alterations that would be missed by these more narrowly focused genomic tests, limiting potential treatment options.

      In fact, national guidelines for non-small cell lung cancer recommend comprehensive NGS testing so that no potentially treatable genomic alterations are overlooked. For example, hotspot testing for the most common mutations in the EGFR gene would still miss 1/6 of the EGFR mutations that occur.

      A comprehensive genomic profiling test uses NGS to look at all of the cancer-related genes in a single sample of tumor tissue and detects all types of alterations. This approach provides the information your physician needs in one single test to help guide a tailored treatment approach using targeted therapies. You and your doctor can use the results from a comprehensive genomic profile to discuss possible treatment options, including FDA-approved targeted therapies or novel targeted treatments under development in clinical trials.
      Comprehensive genomic profiling is a relatively new treatment tool and not yet covered by all insurance carriers in the U.S., but coverage may be appealed on a case-by-case basis and financial assistance may be available.

# What information about the genetics of the cells might be included in the pathology report?
#
# Cytogenetics uses tissue culture and specialized techniques to provide genetic information about cells, particularly genetic alterations. Some genetic alterations are markers or indicators of a specific cancer. For example, the Philadelphia chromosome is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Some alterations can provide information about prognosis, which helps the doctor make treatment recommendations (3). Some tests that might be performed on a tissue sample include:
#
# Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): Determines the positions of particular genes. It can be used to identify chromosomal abnormalities and to map genes.
# Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): A method of making many copies of particular DNA sequences of relevance to the diagnosis.
# Real-time PCR or quantitative PCR: A method of measuring how many copies of a particular DNA sequence are present.
# Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): A method of making many copies of a specific RNA sequence.
# Southern blot hybridization: Detects specific DNA fragments.
# Western blot hybridization: Identifies and analyzes proteins or peptides.
