  >>> How they work
    This type of immunotherapy releases a “brake” on the immune system that normally prevents overly strong immune responses that might damage normal cells as well as abnormal cells. This brake involves proteins on the surface of T cells called immune checkpoint proteins. When immune checkpoint proteins recognize specific partner proteins on other cells, an “off” signal is sent that tells the T cell not to mount an immune response against those cells.

    Two widely studied immune checkpoint proteins are PD-1 and CTLA-4. Some tumor cells express high levels of the PD-1 partner protein PD-L1, which causes T cells to shut down and helps the cancer cells evade immune destruction. Similarly, interactions between B7 proteins on antigen-presenting cells and CTLA-4 that is expressed on T cells prevents T cells from killing other cells, including cancer cells.

    Drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors (or immune checkpoint modulators) prevent the interaction between immune checkpoint proteins and their partner proteins, enabling a strong immune response. The targets of current checkpoint inhibitors include PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4.

  >>> How they are used
    Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved to treat a variety of cancer types, including skin cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), and stomach cancer. One immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), is used to treat any solid tumor that is microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient and has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. Another immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (Opdivo®), is used to treat mismatch repair deficient and microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan hydrochloride.
