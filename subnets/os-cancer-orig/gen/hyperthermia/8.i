  >>> PURPOSE
    Malignant mesothelioma (MM) arising in the peritoneal cavity is a rare neoplasm characterized by peritoneal progression and for which there are limited therapeutic options. We evaluated the peritoneal progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively) for patients with peritoneal MM after surgical resection and regional chemotherapy.

  >>> PATIENTS AND METHODS
    Forty-nine patients (28 males, 21 females; median age, 47 years; range, 16 to 76 years) with MM underwent laparotomy, tumor resection, continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with cisplatin (median dose 250 mg/m2), and a single postoperative intraperitoneal dwell of fluorouracil and paclitaxel (n = 35) on protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board. Standard techniques for actuarial analyses of potential prognostic variables (Kaplan-Meier method with two-tailed log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model) were performed.

  >>> RESULTS
    At a median potential follow-up of 28.3 months, median actuarial PFS is 17 months and actuarial OS is 92 months. Factors associated with improved PFS and OS by the Cox proportional hazards model were a history of previous debulking surgery, absence of deep tissue invasion, minimal residual disease after surgical resection (OS only), and age younger than 60 years (OS only).

  >>> CONCLUSION
    Surgical resection and regional chemotherapy for MM results in durable PFS and OS. Favorable outcome is associated with age, tumor biology (selection of patients with a history of previous debulking), lack of invasive tumor growth, and minimal residual disease after tumor resection.
