name: Molecular and Empirical Formulas

A  **molecular formula** is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule. (A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of compounds.

The  **structural formula** for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule ({'Figure_2_4_MethaneRep Figure 2.4.MethaneRep}). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the atoms.

Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example, most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular formulas H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Other elements commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>), chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>), and iodine (I<sub>2</sub>). The most common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms of sulfur; its molecular formula is S<sub>8</sub> ({'Figure_2_4_Sulfur Figure 2.4.Sulfur}).

It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H<sub>2</sub> and 2H represent distinctly different species. H<sub>2</sub> is a molecular formula; it represents a diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H<sub>2</sub> represents two molecules of diatomic hydrogen ({'Figure_2_4_Hydrogen Figure 2.4.Hydrogen}).

Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an  **empirical formula**, which indicates the types of atoms present and  *the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound*. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This identifies the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the element titanium ({'Figure_2_4_TiO2 Figure 2.4.TiO2}).

As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which the subscripts indicate the  *actual numbers of atoms* of each element in a molecule of the compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its  **molecular mass** (the sum of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the molecular formula for benzene is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> ({'Figure_2_4_Benzene Figure 2.4.Benzene}).

If we know a compound’s formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives vinegar its sharp taste, is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic acid ({'Figure_2_4_AceticAcid Figure 2.4.AceticAcid}) contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>O. Note that a molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

It is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures. For example, could there be another compound with the same formula as acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>? And if so, what would be the structure of its molecules?

If you predict that another compound with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could exist, then you demonstrated good chemical insight and are correct. Two C atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms can also be arranged to form a methyl formate, which is used in manufacturing, as an insecticide, and for quick-drying finishes. Methyl formate molecules have one of the oxygen atoms between the two carbon atoms, differing from the arrangement in acetic acid molecules. Acetic acid and methyl formate are examples of  **isomers**—compounds with the same chemical formula but different molecular structures ({'Figure_2_4_Isomers Figure 2.4.Isomers}). Note that this small difference in the arrangement of the atoms has a major effect on their respective chemical properties. You would certainly not want to use a solution of methyl formate as a substitute for a solution of acetic acid (vinegar) when you make salad dressing.


{image:'Figure_2_4_Isomers}
        

Many types of isomers exist ({'Figure_2_4_Isomers2 Figure 2.4.Isomers2}). Acetic acid and methyl formate are  **structural isomers**, compounds in which the molecules differ in how the atoms are connected to each other. There are also various types of  **spatial isomers**, in which the relative orientations of the atoms in space can be different. For example, the compound carvone (found in caraway seeds, spearmint, and mandarin orange peels) consists of two isomers that are mirror images of each other.  *S*-(+)-carvone smells like caraway, and  *R*-(−)-carvone smells like spearmint.

## The Mole

The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of each type of atom or ion. For example, water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, are alike in that their respective molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different properties. Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the  *mole*, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.

The mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of  *the number* of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of matter. A  **mole** is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a sample of pure <sup>12</sup>C weighing exactly 12 g. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large mass” or “bulk,” which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.

The number of entities composing a mole has been experimentally determined to be 6.02214179 <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mo>×</mo></math> 10<sup>23</sup>, a fundamental constant named  **Avogadro’s number (NA)** or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version being 6.022 <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mo>×</mo></math> 10<sup>23</sup>/mol.

Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically different. The  **molar mass** of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol) (see {'Figure_3_2_moles Figure 3.2.moles}).


{image:'Figure_3_2_moles}
        

Because the definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference substance, <sup>12</sup>C, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the amu definition, a single <sup>12</sup>C atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu). According to the definition of the mole, 12 g of <sup>12</sup>C contains 1 mole of <sup>12</sup>C atoms (its molar mass is 12 g/mol). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic masses are measured relative to that of the amu-reference substance, <sup>12</sup>C. Extending this principle, the molar mass of a compound in grams is likewise numerically equivalent to its formula mass in amu ({'Figure_3_2_compound Figure 3.2.compound}).

While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g (see {'Figure_3_2_water Figure 3.2.water}). Although this represents just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (~18 g), it contains more water molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100 billion molecules.

The relationships between formula mass, the mole, and Avogadro’s number can be applied to compute various quantities that describe the composition of substances and compounds. For example, if we know the mass and chemical composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and calculate the substance’s mass.
