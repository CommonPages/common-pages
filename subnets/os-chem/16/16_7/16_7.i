    In galvanic cells, chemical energy is converted into electrical energy. The opposite is true for electrolytic cells. In  **electrolytic cells**, electrical energy causes nonspontaneous reactions to occur in a process known as  **electrolysis**. The charging electric car pictured in {'Figure_17_0_EVCharging Figure 17.0.EVCharging} at the beginning of this chapter shows one such process. Electrical energy is converted into the chemical energy in the battery as it is charged. Once charged, the battery can be used to power the automobile.
    
    The same principles are involved in electrolytic cells as in galvanic cells. We will look at three electrolytic cells and the quantitative aspects of electrolysis.
