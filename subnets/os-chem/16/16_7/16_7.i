    Electrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox reactions take place ( *galvanic cells*) have been the topic of discussion so far in this chapter. In these cells,  *electrical work is done by a redox system on its surroundings* as electrons produced by the redox reaction are transferred through an external circuit. This final section of the chapter will address an alternative scenario in which  *an external circuit does work on a redox system* by imposing a voltage sufficient to drive an otherwise nonspontaneous reaction, a process known as  **electrolysis**. A familiar example of electrolysis is recharging a battery, which involves use of an external power source to drive the spontaneous (discharge) cell reaction in the reverse direction, restoring to some extent the composition of the half-cells and the voltage of the battery. Perhaps less familiar is the use of electrolysis in the refinement of metallic ores, the manufacture of commodity chemicals, and the  *electroplating* of metallic coatings on various products (e.g., jewelry, utensils, auto parts). To illustrate the essential concepts of electrolysis, a few specific processes will be considered.
