name: Key Concepts and Summary

Nonspontaneous redox processes may be forced to occur in electrochemical cells by the application of an appropriate potential using an external power sourceâ€”a process known as electrolysis. Electrolysis is the basis for certain ore refining processes, the industrial production of many chemical commodities, and the electroplating of metal coatings on various products. Measurement of the current flow during electrolysis permits stoichiometric calculations.
