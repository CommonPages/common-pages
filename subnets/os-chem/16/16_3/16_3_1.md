name: Key Concepts and Summary

Assigning the potential of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as zero volts allows the determination of standard reduction potentials,  *EÂ°*, for half-reactions in electrochemical cells. As the name implies, standard reduction potentials use standard states (1 bar or 1 atm for gases; 1  *M* for solutes, often at 298.15 K) and are written as reductions (where electrons appear on the left side of the equation). The reduction reactions are reversible, so standard cell potentials can be calculated by subtracting the standard reduction potential for the reaction at the anode from the standard reduction potential for the reaction at the cathode. When calculating the standard cell potential, the standard reduction potentials are  *not* scaled by the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced overall equation.
