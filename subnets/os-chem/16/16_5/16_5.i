    There are many technological products associated with the past two centuries of electrochemistry research, none more immediately obvious than the battery. A  **battery** is a galvanic cell that has been specially designed and constructed in a way that best suits its intended use a source of electrical power for specific applications. Among the first successful batteries was the  *Daniell cell*, which relied on the spontaneous oxidation of zinc by copper(II) ions ({'Figure_17_8_Daniell Figure 17.8.Daniell}):

    Modern batteries exist in a multitude of forms to accommodate various applications, from tiny button batteries that provide the modest power needs of a wristwatch to the very large batteries used to supply backup energy to municipal power grids. Some batteries are designed for single-use applications and cannot be recharged ( **primary cells**), while others are based on conveniently reversible cell reactions that allow recharging by an external power source ( **secondary cells**). This section will provide a summary of the basic electrochemical aspects of several batteries familiar to most consumers, and will introduce a related electrochemical device called a  *fuel cell* that can offer improved performance in certain applications.
