name: Key Concepts and Summary

Electrical work ( *w*<sub>ele</sub>) is the negative of the product of the total charge ( *Q*) and the cell potential ( *E*<sub>cell</sub>). The total charge can be calculated as the number of moles of electrons ( *n*) times the Faraday constant ( *F* = 96,485 C/mol e<sup>âˆ’</sup>). Electrical work is the maximum work that the system can produce and so is equal to the change in free energy. Thus, anything that can be done with or to a free energy change can also be done to or with a cell potential. The Nernst equation relates the cell potential at nonstandard conditions to the logarithm of the reaction quotient. Concentration cells exploit this relationship and produce a positive cell potential using half-cells that differ only in the concentration of their solutes.
