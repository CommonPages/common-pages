name: Potential, Free Energy, and Equilibrium - Introduction

So far in this chapter, the relationship between the cell potential and reaction  *spontaneity* has been described, suggesting a link to the free energy change for the reaction (see chapter on thermodynamics). The interpretation of potentials as measures of oxidant  *strength* was presented, bringing to mind similar measures of acid-base strength as reflected in equilibrium constants (see the chapter on acid-base equilibria). This section provides a summary of the relationships between potential and the related thermodynamic properties Î”G and K.
