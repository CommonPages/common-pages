name: Key Concepts and Summary

Crystal field theory treats interactions between the electrons on the metal and the ligands as a simple electrostatic effect. The presence of the ligands near the metal ion changes the energies of the metal  *d* orbitals relative to their energies in the free ion. Both the color and the magnetic properties of a complex can be attributed to this crystal field splitting. The magnitude of the splitting (Î”<sub>oct</sub>) depends on the nature of the ligands bonded to the metal. Strong-field ligands produce large splitting and favor low-spin complexes, in which the  *t*<sub>2g</sub> orbitals are completely filled before any electrons occupy the  *eg* orbitals. Weak-field ligands favor formation of high-spin complexes. The  *t*<sub>2g</sub> and the  *eg* orbitals are singly occupied before any are doubly occupied.
