name: Crystal Field Theory

To explain the observed behavior of transition metal complexes (such as how colors arise), a model involving electrostatic interactions between the electrons from the ligands and the electrons in the unhybridized  *d* orbitals of the central metal atom has been developed. This electrostatic model is  **crystal field theory** (CFT). It allows us to understand, interpret, and predict the colors, magnetic behavior, and some structures of coordination compounds of transition metals.

CFT focuses on the nonbonding electrons on the central metal ion in coordination complexes not on the metal-ligand bonds. Like valence bond theory, CFT tells only part of the story of the behavior of complexes. However, it tells the part that valence bond theory does not. In its pure form, CFT ignores any covalent bonding between ligands and metal ions. Both the ligand and the metal are treated as infinitesimally small point charges.

All electrons are negative, so the electrons donated from the ligands will repel the electrons of the central metal. Let us consider the behavior of the electrons in the unhybridized  *d* orbitals in an octahedral complex. The five  *d* orbitals consist of lobe-shaped regions and are arranged in space, as shown in {'Figure_19_3_Dorbital Figure 19.3.Dorbital}. In an octahedral complex, the six ligands coordinate along the axes.

In an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five  *d* orbitals in accord with Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal ion, the energies of the  *d* orbitals are no longer the same.

In octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five  *d* orbitals, the <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></math> and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mtext>−</mtext><msup><mi>y</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></math> orbitals, point toward the ligands ({'Figure_19_3_Dorbital Figure 19.3.Dorbital}). These two orbitals are called the  **eg orbitals** (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry of the orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The other three orbitals, the  *dxy*,  *dxz*, and  *dyz* orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the  **t2g orbitals** (again, the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal ion along the axes of the octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the  *d* orbitals of the metal ion. However, the repulsions between the electrons in the  *eg* orbitals (the <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></math> and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mtext>−</mtext><msup><mi>y</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msub></mrow></math> orbitals) and the ligands are greater than the repulsions between the electrons in the  *t*<sub>2g</sub> orbitals (the  *dzy*,  *dxz*, and  *dyz* orbitals) and the ligands. This is because the lobes of the  *eg* orbitals point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the  *t*<sub>2g</sub> orbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the  *eg* orbitals of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have higher potential energies than those of electrons in the  *t*<sub>2g</sub> orbitals. The difference in energy may be represented as shown in {'Figure_19_3_CFSE Figure 19.3.CFSE}.

The difference in energy between the  *eg* and the  *t*<sub>2g</sub> orbitals is called the  **crystal field splitting** and is symbolized by  **Δoct**, where oct stands for octahedral.

The magnitude of Δ<sub>oct</sub> depends on many factors, including the nature of the six ligands located around the central metal ion, the charge on the metal, and whether the metal is using 3 *d*, 4 *d*, or 5 *d* orbitals. Different ligands produce different crystal field splittings. The increasing crystal field splitting produced by ligands is expressed in the  **spectrochemical series**, a short version of which is given here:

In this series, ligands on the left cause small crystal field splittings and are  **weak-field ligands**, whereas those on the right cause larger splittings and are  **strong-field ligands**. Thus, the Δ<sub>oct</sub> value for an octahedral complex with iodide ligands (I<sup>−</sup>) is much smaller than the Δ<sub>oct</sub> value for the same metal with cyanide ligands (CN<sup>−</sup>).

Electrons in the  *d* orbitals follow the aufbau (“filling up”) principle, which says that the orbitals will be filled to give the lowest total energy, just as in main group chemistry. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, the like charges repel each other. The energy needed to pair up two electrons in a single orbital is called the  **pairing energy (P)**. Electrons will always singly occupy each orbital in a degenerate set before pairing. P is similar in magnitude to Δ<sub>oct</sub>. When electrons fill the  *d* orbitals, the relative magnitudes of Δ<sub>oct</sub> and P determine which orbitals will be occupied.

In [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4−</sup>, the strong field of six cyanide ligands produces a large Δ<sub>oct</sub>. Under these conditions, the electrons require less energy to pair than they require to be excited to the  *eg* orbitals (Δ<sub>oct</sub> > P). The six 3 *d* electrons of the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion pair in the three  *t*<sub>2g</sub> orbitals ({'Figure_19_3_Lowhigh Figure 19.3.Lowhigh}). Complexes in which the electrons are paired because of the large crystal field splitting are called  **low-spin complexes** because the number of unpaired electrons (spins) is minimized.


{image:'Figure_19_3_Lowhigh}
        

In [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, on the other hand, the weak field of the water molecules produces only a small crystal field splitting (Δ<sub>oct</sub> < P). Because it requires less energy for the electrons to occupy the  *eg* orbitals than to pair together, there will be an electron in each of the five 3 *d* orbitals before pairing occurs. For the six  *d* electrons on the iron(II) center in [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, there will be one pair of electrons and four unpaired electrons ({'Figure_19_3_Lowhigh Figure 19.3.Lowhigh}). Complexes such as the [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> ion, in which the electrons are unpaired because the crystal field splitting is not large enough to cause them to pair, are called  **high-spin complexes** because the number of unpaired electrons (spins) is maximized.

A similar line of reasoning shows why the [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−</sup> ion is a low-spin complex with only one unpaired electron, whereas both the [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> and [FeF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−</sup> ions are high-spin complexes with five unpaired electrons.

The other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of  *trans* ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the  *z*-axis. This changes the distribution of the  *d* orbitals, as orbitals on or near the  *z*-axis become more stable, and those on or near the  *x-* or  *y*-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral  *t*<sub>2g</sub> and the  *eg* sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern with no simple Δ<sub>oct</sub>. The basic pattern is:
