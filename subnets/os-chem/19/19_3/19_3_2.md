name: Magnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions

Experimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as O<sub>2</sub> that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules such as N<sub>2</sub> and ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> and [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4−</sup> that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.

When an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic moment of low-spin  *d*<sup>6</sup> [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4−</sup> confirms that iron is diamagnetic, whereas high-spin  *d*<sup>6</sup> [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.
