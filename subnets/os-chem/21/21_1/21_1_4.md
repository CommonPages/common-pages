name: Alkynes

Hydrocarbon molecules with one or more triple bonds are called  **alkynes**; they make up another series of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Two carbon atoms joined by a triple bond are bound together by one σ bond and two π bonds. The  *sp*-hybridized carbons involved in the triple bond have bond angles of 180°, giving these types of bonds a linear, rod-like shape.

The simplest member of the alkyne series is ethyne, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, commonly called acetylene. The Lewis structure for ethyne, a linear molecule, is:

The IUPAC nomenclature for alkynes is similar to that for alkenes except that the suffix  *-yne* is used to indicate a triple bond in the chain. For example, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>CH</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><msub><mrow><mtext>CH</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mtext>C</mtext><mo>≡</mo><mtext>CH</mtext></mrow></math> is called 1-butyne.

Chemically, the alkynes are similar to the alkenes. Since the <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>C</mtext><mo>≡</mo><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math> functional group has two π bonds, alkynes typically react even more readily, and react with twice as much reagent in addition reactions. The reaction of acetylene with bromine is a typical example:

Acetylene and the other alkynes also burn readily. An acetylene torch takes advantage of the high heat of combustion for acetylene.
