name: Key Concepts and Summary

Concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in aqueous media are often represented as logarithmic pH and pOH values, respectively. At 25 °C, the autoprotolysis equilibrium for water requires the sum of pH and pOH to equal 14 for any aqueous solution. The relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ion in a solution define its status as acidic ([H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] > [OH<sup>−</sup>]), basic ([H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] < [OH<sup>−</sup>]), or neutral ([H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>−</sup>]). At 25 °C, a pH < 7 indicates an acidic solution, a pH > 7 a basic solution, and a pH = 7 a neutral solution.
