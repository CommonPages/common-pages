name: Buffer Capacity

Buffer solutions do not have an unlimited capacity to keep the pH relatively constant ({'Figure_14_6_exhaust Figure 14.6.exhaust}). If we add so much base to a buffer that the weak acid is exhausted, no more buffering action toward the base is possible. On the other hand, if we add an excess of acid, the weak base would be exhausted, and no more buffering action toward any additional acid would be possible. In fact, we do not even need to exhaust all of the acid or base in a buffer to overwhelm it; its buffering action will diminish rapidly as a given component nears depletion.

The  **buffer capacity** is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a given volume of a buffer solution before the pH changes significantly, usually by one unit. Buffer capacity depends on the amounts of the weak acid and its conjugate base that are in a buffer mixture. For example, 1 L of a solution that is 1.0  *M* in acetic acid and 1.0  *M* in sodium acetate has a greater buffer capacity than 1 L of a solution that is 0.10  *M* in acetic acid and 0.10  *M* in sodium acetate even though both solutions have the same pH. The first solution has more buffer capacity because it contains more acetic acid and acetate ion.
