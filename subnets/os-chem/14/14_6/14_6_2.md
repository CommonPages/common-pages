name: Buffer Capacity

Buffer solutions do not have an unlimited capacity to keep the pH relatively constant ({'Figure_14_6_exhaust Figure 14.6.exhaust}). Instead, the ability of a buffer solution to resist changes in pH relies on the presence of appreciable amounts of its conjugate weak acid-base pair. When enough strong acid or base is added to substantially lower the concentration of either member of the buffer pair, the buffering action within the solution is compromised.

The  **buffer capacity** is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a given volume of a buffer solution before the pH changes significantly, usually by one unit. Buffer capacity depends on the amounts of the weak acid and its conjugate base that are in a buffer mixture. For example, 1 L of a solution that is 1.0  *M* in acetic acid and 1.0  *M* in sodium acetate has a greater buffer capacity than 1 L of a solution that is 0.10  *M* in acetic acid and 0.10  *M* in sodium acetate even though both solutions have the same pH. The first solution has more buffer capacity because it contains more acetic acid and acetate ion.
