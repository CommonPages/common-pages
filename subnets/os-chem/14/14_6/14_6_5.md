name: Key Concepts and Summary

A solution containing a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or of a weak base and its conjugate acid, is called a buffer solution. The presence of a weak conjugate acid-base pair provides reactants that may neutralize small additions of strong acid or base, yielding weaker conjugate partners. The hydronium ion concentration of a buffer solution therefore does not change significantly when a small amount of acid or base is added.
