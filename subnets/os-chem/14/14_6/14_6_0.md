name: Buffers - Introduction

A solution containing appreciable amounts of a weak conjugate acid-base pair is called a buffer solution, or a  **buffer**. Buffer solutions resist a change in pH when small amounts of a strong acid or a strong base are added ({'Figure_14_6_compare Figure 14.6.compare}). A solution of acetic acid and sodium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>COONa) is an example of a buffer that consists of a weak acid and its salt. An example of a buffer that consists of a weak base and its salt is a solution of ammonia and ammonium chloride (NH<sub>3</sub>( *aq*) + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl( *aq*)).
