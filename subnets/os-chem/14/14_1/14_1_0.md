name: Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases - Introduction

The acid-base reaction class has been studied for quite some time. In 1680, Robert  **Boyle** reported traits of acid solutions that included their ability to dissolve many substances, to change the colors of certain natural dyes, and to lose these traits after coming in contact with alkali (base) solutions. In the eighteenth century, it was recognized that acids have a sour taste, react with limestone to liberate a gaseous substance (now known to be CO<sub>2</sub>), and interact with alkalis to form neutral substances. In 1815, Humphry  **Davy** contributed greatly to the development of the modern acid-base concept by demonstrating that hydrogen is the essential constituent of acids. Around that same time, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac concluded that acids are substances that can neutralize bases and that these two classes of substances can be defined only in terms of each other. The significance of hydrogen was reemphasized in 1884 when Svante  **Arrhenius** defined an acid as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydrogen cations (now recognized to be hydronium ions) and a base as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydroxide anions.

Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry proposed a more general description in 1923 in which acids and bases were defined in terms of the transfer of hydrogen ions, H<sup>+</sup>. (Note that these hydrogen ions are often referred to simply as  *protons*, since that subatomic particle is the only component of cations derived from the most abundant hydrogen isotope, <sup>1</sup>H.) A compound that donates a proton to another compound is called a  **Brønsted-Lowry acid**, and a compound that accepts a proton is called a  **Brønsted-Lowry base**. An acid-base reaction is, thus, the transfer of a proton from a donor (acid) to an acceptor (base).

The concept of  *conjugate pairs* is useful in describing Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions (and other reversible reactions, as well). When an acid donates H<sup>+</sup>, the species that remains is called the  **conjugate base** of the acid because it reacts as a proton acceptor in the reverse reaction. Likewise, when a base accepts H<sup>+</sup>, it is converted to its  **conjugate acid**. The reaction between water and ammonia illustrates this idea. In the forward direction, water acts as an acid by donating a proton to ammonia and subsequently becoming a hydroxide ion, OH<sup>−</sup>, the conjugate base of water. The ammonia acts as a base in accepting this proton, becoming an ammonium ion, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msup><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow><mtext>+</mtext></mrow></msup><mtext>,</mtext></mrow></math> the conjugate acid of ammonia. In the reverse direction, a hydroxide ion acts as a base in accepting a proton from ammonium ion, which acts as an acid.

The reaction between a Brønsted-Lowry acid and water is called  **acid ionization**. For example, when hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water and ionizes, protons are transferred from hydrogen fluoride molecules to water molecules, yielding hydronium ions and fluoride ions:

 **Base ionization** of a species occurs when it accepts protons from water molecules. In the example below, pyridine molecules, C<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>5</sub>, undergo base ionization when dissolved in water, yielding hydroxide and pyridinium ions:

The preceding ionization reactions suggest that water may function as both a base (as in its reaction with hydrogen fluoride) and an acid (as in its reaction with ammonia).  Species capable of either donating or accepting protons are called  **amphiprotric**, or more generally,  **amphoteric**, a term that may be used for acids and bases per definitions other than the Brønsted-Lowry one.  The equations below show the two possible acid-base reactions for two amphiprotic species, bicarbonate ion and water:

The first equation represents the reaction of bicarbonate as an acid with water as a base, whereas the second represents reaction of bicarbonate as a base with water as an acid. When bicarbonate is added to water, both these equilibria are established simultaneously and the composition of the resulting solution may be determined through appropriate equilibrium calculations, as described later in this chapter.

In the liquid state, molecules of an amphiprotic substance can react with one another as illustrated for water in the equations below:

The process in which like molecules react to yield ions is called  **autoionization**. Liquid water undergoes autoionization to a very slight extent; at 25 °C, approximately two out of every billion water molecules are ionized. The extent of the water autoionization process is reflected in the value of its equilibrium constant, the  **ion-product constant for water, Kw**:

The slight ionization of pure water is reflected in the small value of the equilibrium constant; at 25 °C,  *K*<sub>w</sub> has a value of 1.0 <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mo>×</mo></math> 10<sup>−14</sup>. The process is endothermic, and so the extent of ionization and the resulting concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion increase with temperature. For example, at 100 °C, the value for  *K*<sub>w</sub> is about 5.6 <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mo>×</mo></math> 10<sup>−13</sup>, roughly 50 times larger than the value at 25 °C.
