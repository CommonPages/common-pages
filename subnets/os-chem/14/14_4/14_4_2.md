name: Salts with Acidic and Basic Ions

Some salts are composed of both acidic and basic ions, and so the pH of their solutions will depend on the relative strengths of these two species. Likewise, some salts contain a single ion that is amphiprotic, and so the relative strengths of this ion’s acid and base character will determine its effect on solution pH. For both types of salts, a comparison of the  *K*<sub>a</sub> and  *K*<sub>b</sub> values allows prediction of the solution’s acid-base status, as illustrated in the following example exercise.
