name: Equilibrium in a Solution of a Salt of a Weak Acid and a Weak Base

In a solution of a salt formed by the reaction of a weak acid and a weak base, the saltâ€™s cation will be a weak acid (the conjugate acid of the weak base reactant) and its anion will be a weak base (the conjugate base of the weak acid reactant). To predict the pH of the salt solution, we must know both the  *K*<sub>a</sub> of the acidic cation and the  *K*<sub>b</sub> of the basic anion. If  *K*<sub>a</sub> >  *K*<sub>b</sub>, the solution is acidic, and if  *K*<sub>b</sub> >  *K*<sub>a</sub>, the solution is basic.
