name: Key Concepts and Summary

The strengths of Br√∏nsted-Lowry acids and bases in aqueous solutions can be determined by their acid or base ionization constants. Stronger acids form weaker conjugate bases, and weaker acids form stronger conjugate bases. Thus strong acids are completely ionized in aqueous solution because their conjugate bases are weaker bases than water. Weak acids are only partially ionized because their conjugate bases are strong enough to compete successfully with water for possession of protons. Strong bases react with water to quantitatively form hydroxide ions. Weak bases give only small amounts of hydroxide ion. The strengths of the binary acids increase from left to right across a period of the periodic table (CH<sub>4</sub> < NH<sub>3</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>O < HF), and they increase down a group (HF < HCl < HBr < HI). The strengths of oxyacids that contain the same central element increase as the oxidation number of the element increases (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). The strengths of oxyacids also increase as the electronegativity of the central element increases [H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>].
