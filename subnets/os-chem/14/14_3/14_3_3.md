name: Effect of Molecular Structure on Acid-Base Strength

## Binary Acids and Bases

In the absence of any leveling effect, the acid strength of binary compounds of hydrogen with nonmetals (A) increases as the H-A bond strength decreases down a group in the periodic table. For group 17, the order of increasing acidity is HF < HCl < HBr < HI. Likewise, for group 16, the order of increasing acid strength is H<sub>2</sub>O < H<sub>2</sub>S < H<sub>2</sub>Se < H<sub>2</sub>Te.

Across a row in the periodic table, the acid strength of binary hydrogen compounds increases with increasing electronegativity of the nonmetal atom because the polarity of the H-A bond increases. Thus, the order of increasing acidity (for removal of one proton) across the second row is CH<sub>4</sub> < NH<sub>3</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>O < HF; across the third row, it is SiH<sub>4</sub> < PH<sub>3</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>S < HCl (see {'Figure_14_3_AcidpH Figure 14.3.AcidpH}).
