name: Key Concepts and Summary

The relative strengths of acids and bases are reflected in the magnitudes of their ionization constants; the stronger the acid or base, the larger its ionization constant. A reciprocal relation exists between the strengths of a conjugate acid-base pair: the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. Water exerts a leveling effect on dissolved acids or bases, reacting completely to generate its characteristic hydronium and hydroxide ions (the strongest acid and base that may exist in water). The strengths of the binary acids increase from left to right across a period of the periodic table (CH<sub>4</sub> < NH<sub>3</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>O < HF), and they increase down a group (HF < HCl < HBr < HI). The strengths of oxyacids that contain the same central element increase as the oxidation number of the element increases (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). The strengths of oxyacids also increase as the electronegativity of the central element increases [H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> < H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>].
