name: Key Concepts and Summary

Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use SI (International System) units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and g/cm<sup>3</sup> (for density). In many cases, it is convenient to use prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10<sup>âˆ’6</sup> seconds) and megahertz (10<sup>6</sup> hertz), respectively.
