name: Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results - Introduction

It is often the case that a quantity of interest may not be easy (or even possible) to measure directly but instead must be calculated from other directly measured properties and appropriate mathematical relationships. For example, consider measuring the average speed of an athlete running sprints. This is typically accomplished by measuring the  *time* required for the athlete to run from the starting line to the finish line, and the  *distance* between these two lines, and then computing  *speed* from the equation that relates these three properties:

An Olympic-quality sprinter can run 100 m in approximately 10 s, corresponding to an average speed of

Note that this simple arithmetic involves dividing the numbers of each measured quantity to yield the number of the computed quantity (100/10 = 10)  *and likewise* dividing the units of each measured quantity to yield the unit of the computed quantity (m/s = m/s). Now, consider using this same relation to predict the time required for a person running at this speed to travel a distance of 25 m. The same relation among the three properties is used, but in this case, the two quantities provided are a speed (10 m/s) and a distance (25 m). To yield the sought property, time, the equation must be rearranged appropriately:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>time</mtext><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>distance</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>speed</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

The time can then be computed as:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mtext>25 m</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>10 m/s</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mtext>2.5 s</mtext></mrow></math>

Again, arithmetic on the numbers (25/10 = 2.5) was accompanied by the same arithmetic on the units (m/m/s = s) to yield the number and unit of the result, 2.5 s. Note that, just as for numbers, when a unit is divided by an identical unit (in this case, m/m), the result is “1”—or, as commonly phrased, the units “cancel.”

These calculations are examples of a versatile mathematical approach known as  **dimensional analysis** (or the  **factor-label method**). Dimensional analysis is based on this premise:  *the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations as their associated numbers*. This method can be applied to computations ranging from simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several different quantities.
