name: Key Concepts and Summary

The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals are filled (1 *s*, 2 *s*, 2 *p*, 3 *s*, 3 *p*, 4 *s*, 3 *d*, 4 *p*, and so on). Electron configurations and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hundâ€™s rule (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).

Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last electron to be added is placed: main group elements ( *s* and  *p* orbitals), transition elements ( *d* orbitals), and inner transition elements ( *f* orbitals).
