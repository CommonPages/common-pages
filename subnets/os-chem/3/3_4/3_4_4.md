name: Electron Configurations of Ions

Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. A cation (positively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are removed from a parent atom. For main group elements, the electrons that were added last are the first electrons removed. For transition metals and inner transition metals, however, electrons in the  *s*  orbital are easier to remove than the  *d*  or  *f*  electrons, and so the  highest   *ns*  electrons are lost, and then the ( *n* – 1) *d*  or  ( *n* – 2) *f* electrons are removed. An anion (negatively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are added to a parent atom. The added electrons fill in the order predicted by the Aufbau principle.
