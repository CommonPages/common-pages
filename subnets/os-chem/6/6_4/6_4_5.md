In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution componentsâ€™ masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used.
