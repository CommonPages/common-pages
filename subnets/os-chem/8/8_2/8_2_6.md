name: Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a  **standard temperature and pressure (STP)** for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). At STP, one mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 Lâ€”this is referred to as the  **standard molar volume** ({'Figure_9_2_HENH3O2 Figure 9.2.HENH3O2}).
