name: Gas Pressure - Introduction

The earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure, as does any other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric pressure, we are sensitive to pressure changes—for example, when your ears “pop” during take-off and landing while flying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gas molecules colliding with the surfaces of objects ({'Figure_9_1_Pressure1 Figure 9.1.Pressure1}). Although the force of each collision is very small, any surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisions in a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air pressure is strong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from inside the container.

Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the column of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object, such as the tanker car. At sea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown African elephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. These may seem like huge amounts, and they are, but life on earth has evolved under such atmospheric pressure. If you actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is *twice* the usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.

In general,  **pressure** is defined as the force exerted on a given area: <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mi>F</mi><mi>A</mi></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing the amount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure can be decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area.

Let’s apply this concept to determine which would be more likely to fall through thin ice in {'Figure_9_1_Pressure2 Figure 9.1.Pressure2}—the elephant or the figure skater? A large African elephant can weigh 7 tons, supported on four feet, each with a diameter of about 1.5 ft (footprint area of 250 in<sup>2</sup>), so the pressure exerted by each foot is about 14 lb/in<sup>2</sup>:

The figure skater weighs about 120 lbs, supported on two skate blades, each with an area of about 2 in<sup>2</sup>, so the pressure exerted by each blade is about 30 lb/in<sup>2</sup>:

Even though the elephant is more than one hundred-times heavier than the skater, it exerts less than one-half of the pressure and would therefore be less likely to fall though thin ice. On the other hand, if the skater removes her skates and stands with bare feet (or regular footwear) on the ice, the larger area over which her weight is applied greatly reduces the pressure exerted:

The SI unit of pressure is the  **pascal (Pa)**, with 1 Pa = 1 N/m<sup>2</sup>, where N is the newton, a unit of force defined as 1 kg m/s<sup>2</sup>. One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases, it is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) or  **bar** (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds of force on an area of one square inch— **pounds per square inch (psi)**—for example, in car tires. Pressure can also be measured using the unit  **atmosphere (atm)**, which originally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximate latitude of Paris (45°).  provides some information on these and a few other common units for pressure measurements

We can measure atmospheric pressure, the force exerted by the atmosphere on the earth’s surface, with a  **barometer** ({'Figure_9_1_Barometer Figure 9.1.Barometer}). A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.


{image:'Figure_9_1_Barometer}
        

If the liquid is water, normal atmospheric pressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is rather inconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury (Hg) is about 13.6-times denser than water, a mercury barometer only needs to be <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>13.6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math> as tall as a water barometer—a more suitable size. Standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm at sea level (101,325 Pa) corresponds to a column of mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high. The  **torr** was originally intended to be a unit equal to one millimeter of mercury, but it no longer corresponds exactly. The pressure exerted by a fluid due to gravity is known as  **hydrostatic pressure**,  *p*:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>h</mi><mi>ρ</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></math>

where  *h* is the height of the fluid,  *ρ* is the density of the fluid, and  *g* is acceleration due to gravity.

A  **manometer** is a device similar to a barometer that can be used to measure the pressure of a gas trapped in a container. A closed-end manometer is a U-shaped tube with one closed arm, one arm that connects to the gas to be measured, and a nonvolatile liquid (usually mercury) in between. As with a barometer, the distance between the liquid levels in the two arms of the tube ( *h* in the diagram) is proportional to the pressure of the gas in the container. An open-end manometer ({'Figure_9_1_Manometer Figure 9.1.Manometer}) is the same as a closed-end manometer, but one of its arms is open to the atmosphere. In this case, the distance between the liquid levels corresponds to the difference in pressure between the gas in the container and the atmosphere.
