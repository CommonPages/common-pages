name: Density of a Gas

Recall that the density of a gas is its mass to volume ratio, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>ρ</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mi>m</mi><mi>V</mi></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> Therefore, if we can determine the mass of some volume of a gas, we will get its density. The density of an unknown gas can used to determine its molar mass and thereby assist in its identification. The ideal gas law,  *PV* =  *nRT*, provides us with a means of deriving such a mathematical formula to relate the density of a gas to its volume in the proof shown in .

We must specify both the temperature and the pressure of a gas when calculating its density because the number of moles of a gas (and thus the mass of the gas) in a liter changes with temperature or pressure. Gas densities are often reported at STP.

## Molar Mass of a Gas

Another useful application of the ideal gas law involves the determination of molar mass. By definition, the molar mass of a substance is the ratio of its mass in grams,  *m*, to its amount in moles,  *n*:

The ideal gas equation can be rearranged to isolate  *n*:

and then combined with the molar mass equation to yield:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>ℳ</mtext><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

This equation can be used to derive the molar mass of a gas from measurements of its pressure, volume, temperature, and mass.

## The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton’s Law

Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other’s pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container ({'Figure_9_3_DaltonLaw1 Figure 9.3.DaltonLaw1}). The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its  **partial pressure**. This observation is summarized by  **Dalton’s law of partial pressures**:  *The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases*:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>C</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>...</mn><mo>=</mo><msub><mtext>Σ</mtext><mtext>i</mtext></msub><msub><mi>P</mi><mtext>i</mtext></msub></mrow></math>

In the equation  *PTotal* is the total pressure of a mixture of gases,  *PA* is the partial pressure of gas A;  *PB* is the partial pressure of gas B;  *PC* is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.

The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its  **mole fraction (X)**, a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><msub><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mspace width="2em"/><mtext>where</mtext><mspace width="2em"/><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>A</mi></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

where  *PA*,  *XA*, and  *nA* are the partial pressure, mole fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and  *nTotal* is the number of moles of all components in the mixture.

Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.

## Collection of Gases over Water

A simple way to collect gases that do not react with water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with water and inverted into a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be made equal to the air pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the water level is the same both inside and outside the bottle ({'Figure_9_3_WaterVapor Figure 9.3.WaterVapor}), the pressure of the gas is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer.

However, there is another factor we must consider when we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water evaporates and there is always gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collected over water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixture equals the partial pressure of the gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. The pressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure minus the pressure of the water vapor—this is referred to as the “dry” gas pressure, that is, the pressure of the gas only, without water vapor. The  **vapor pressure of water**, which is the pressure exerted by water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water in a closed container, depends on the temperature ({'Figure_9_3_WaterVapor2 Figure 9.3.WaterVapor2}); more detailed information on the temperature dependence of water vapor can be found in , and vapor pressure will be discussed in more detail in the chapter on liquids.
