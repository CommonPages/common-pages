#  *sp*<sup>2</sup> Hybridization

The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density consist of a set of three  **sp2 hybrid orbitals** and one unhybridized  *p* orbital. This arrangement results from  *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridization, the mixing of one  *s* orbital and two  *p* orbitals to produce three identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry ({'Figure_8_2_sp2Geom Figure 8.2.sp2Geom}).

Although quantum mechanics yields the “plump” orbital lobes as depicted in {'Figure_8_2_sp2Geom Figure 8.2.sp2Geom}, sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor lobes, as in {'Figure_8_2_sp2Conv Figure 8.2.sp2Conv}, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use these “thinner” representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily visualize.

The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH<sub>3,</sub> suggests  *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen atoms ({'Figure_8_2_BH3 Figure 8.2.BH3}). We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH<sub>3</sub> as shown in the orbital energy level diagram in {'Figure_8_2_BH3Diag Figure 8.2.BH3Diag}. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the boron atom in the three  *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron pairs with a hydrogen electron when B–H bonds form.

Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit  *sp*<sup>2</sup> hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on the central atom, such as ClNO ({'Figure_8_2_sp2Ex Figure 8.2.sp2Ex}), or molecules with two single bonds and a double bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH<sub>2</sub>O, and ethene, H<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>.
