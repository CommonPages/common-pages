name: Dipole Moments and Ionic Character

Now that we have seen the importance of understanding the connection between the location of 

electrons in atoms and the properties of elements, we can expand our understanding of the 

connection between atoms. This will be an introduction to more advanced aspects of the 

chemical bond, which is the very heart of chemistry itself. With the sole exception of the noble 

gases, atoms by themselves do not possess the most stable possible electron configuration. That 

is where the concept of chemical bonding comes into its own: atoms can attain a stable 

configuration by exchanging electrons with another atom, resulting in the formation of ions.


Ions, in turn, can associate by charge – simple Coulombic attraction – resulting in the formation of compounds we call ionic compounds. We will look at the ionic nature of bonds 

first, from a simple positive-negative attraction standpoint. Just as important is that some atoms 

bond by sharing rather than exchanging electrons; the sharing of electrons gives rise to the 

covalent bond. To add just one more dimension, some chemical species are neither completely 

ionic nor completely covalent; these species possess a permanent dipole, and are classified as 

polar.

In your introductory physics course, you will likely discuss the concept of Coulombic 

interactions in much more rigorous detail than we will do here. We are interested primarily in the 

differences in properties between species that arise from their relative covalent, ionic, or polar 

nature – not in a rigorous model of those properties. We are concerned with the connection 

between potential energy and force and the relative separation (or lack of separation) between 

charges. We begin by defining the electric or Coulomb force as the product of the charges 

divided by the square of the distance between those charges:

Here,  *Q* is taken to be the fundamental constant of electron charge: one electron has a charge of

(We will work exclusively in the SI system, so distances will be measured in 

meters (m)).

And as you may recall, energy is force times distance, so

To illustrate the trend in attractive force, we will consider first the attractive force between two

ions of single charge separated by a distance of 2 *d*:

And then the attractive force between two ions of double charge separated by a distance  *d*:

<math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>−2</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mrow><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></math>

The force of attraction increases with the charge and decreases with increased distance.

If all matter were composed of ions that would be the end of the story, but it clearly is not.  There 

are molecules for which the charge – either positive or negative – is permanently concentrated 

more on one atom than the other.  Notice we say atom, because these compounds are not 

composed of ions but rather of atoms sharing electrons through covalent bonds.

## Bond Dipole Moments


The concept of a bond dipole moment allows us to examine the partial separation of charge 

between atoms.  It is a simple model when applied to diatomic molecules, which will be more 

than sufficient for our purposes. The dipole moment of a bond is defined as the charge times the 

distance – charge once again being measured in multiples of the charge on an electron, or 

coulombs. The distance will always be in meters.  Because we are considering very small 

charges and distances, and because it is the relative separation of charge rather than the actual 

value for it that we are interested in, we will introduce a new unit called the Debye, named after 

the physical chemist Peter Debye:

<math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mn>1</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>Debye</mtext><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>(D)</mtext><mo>=</mo><mn>3.336</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>−30</mn></msup><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>C-m</mtext><mspace width="3em"/><mo>μ</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>d</mi></math>

The usefulness of the Debye unit will be shown by example:




For HCl, the bond dipole moment is known to be 1.08 D




For HI, the bond dipole moment is known to be 0.44 D

Comparing the two, we can see that HI is less polar than HCl, which is what we would expect 

based on electronegativity values.

We have now made a transition between the concept of an ionic compound and a partially ionic

one. Of course, the partially ionic compound must also by definition be partially covalent.

## Partial Ionic Character


The concept of the bond dipole moment helps bridge the concepts of ionic and covalent bonding.  

Because there is a separation of charge that is less complete than it is in an ionic bond, we can 

refer to polar bonds as being partially ionic in nature. In contrast to sodium chloride, hydrogen 

chloride shows partial charges (indicated with a delta notation) on the hydrogen and chlorine.  As 

you would expect from the electronegativity values, hydrogen carries a partial positive charge, 

while chlorine carries a partial negative charge. Where do these charges come from?


It is easy to come up with the partial charges by comparing the actual dipole moments 

(which can be obtained experimentally, using spectroscopy) with the dipole expected in the 

limiting case (that is, if we were to consider the molecule ionic).  The actual dipole moment is 

1.03 D.

What does the result suggest about the relative polarity of the HI bond vs. that of the HCl bond?

Does the calculated dipole and percent ionic character reconcile with the difference in 

electronegativity between Cl and I?

The electron configuration of an atom or ion is key to understanding the chemical 

behavior of an element. The atoms that make up the element combine in various ways, ranging 

from the mostly ionic (NaCl) to the partially ionic (HCl) to what we will call purely covalent.   

At the most fundamental level, all chemical bonds involve electrons, and a significant percentage 

of chemical and physical properties can be explained by considering the location and separation 

of charge in a species. By understanding the structure of matter at the atomic level, we can begin 

to build an understanding of the behavior of matter at both the microscopic and macroscopic 

levels.

An understanding of dipoles and partial ionic character is fundamental to understanding 

the interactions between particles, which we will examine in the chapter on liquids and solids. 

These intermolecular forces become important in the liquid and solid states of matter.
