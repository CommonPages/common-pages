name: Reaction Yields - Introduction

The relative amounts of reactants and products represented in a balanced chemical equation are often referred to as  *stoichiometric amounts*. All the exercises of the preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, when calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or greater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants are not present in stoichiometric amounts.
