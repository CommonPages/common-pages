name: Percent Yield

The amount of product that  *may be* produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the  **theoretical yield** of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the  **actual yield**, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by  *side reactions* that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction’s theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its  **percent yield**:

Actual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas). As long as both yields are expressed using the same units, these units will cancel when percent yield is calculated.
