The described approach to measuring vinegar strength was an early version of the analytical technique known as  **titration analysis**. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a  **buret** ({'Figure_4_5_titration Figure 4.5.titration}) to make incremental additions of a solution containing a known concentration of some substance (the  **titrant**) to a sample solution containing the substance whose concentration is to be measured (the  **analyte**). The titrant and analyte undergo a chemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrant solution required for complete reaction with the analyte (the  **equivalence point** of the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration. The equivalence point of a titration may be detected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solution accompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in the classic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, special dyes called  **indicators** are added to the sample solutions to impart a change in color at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence points may also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in a predictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approach taken to detect a titrationâ€™s equivalence point, the volume of titrant actually measured is called the  **end point**. Properly designed titration methods typically ensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible. Though any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titration analysis, the three described in this chapter (precipitation, acid-base, and redox) are most common. Additional details regarding titration analysis are provided in the chapter on acid-base equilibria.
