The composition of a reaction mixture may be represented by a mathematical function known as the reaction quotient,  *Q*. For a reaction at equilibrium, the composition is constant, and  *Q* is called the equilibrium constant,  *K*.

A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases.
