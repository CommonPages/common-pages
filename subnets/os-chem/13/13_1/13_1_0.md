name: Chemical Equilibria - Introduction

A chemical reaction is usually written in a way that suggests it proceeds in one direction, the direction in which we read, but all chemical reactions are reversible, and both the forward and reverse reaction occur to one degree or another depending on conditions. In a chemical  **equilibrium**, the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, and the concentrations of products and reactants remain constant. If we run a reaction in a closed system so that the products cannot escape, we often find the reaction does not give a 100% yield of products. Instead, some reactants remain after the concentrations stop changing. At this point, when there is no further change in concentrations of reactants and products, we say the reaction is at equilibrium. A mixture of reactants and products is found at equilibrium.

For example, when we place a sample of dinitrogen tetroxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, a colorless gas) in a glass tube, it forms nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>, a brown gas) by the reaction

The color becomes darker as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is converted to NO<sub>2</sub>. When the system reaches equilibrium, both N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> are present ({'Figure_13_1_equilibrium Figure 13.1.equilibrium}).

The formation of NO<sub>2</sub> from N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is a  **reversible reaction**, which is identified by the equilibrium arrow <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mtext>(⇌)</mtext></math>. All reactions are reversible, but many reactions, for all practical purposes, proceed in one direction until the reactants are exhausted and will reverse only under certain conditions. Such reactions are often depicted with a one-way arrow from reactants to products. Many other reactions, such as the formation of NO<sub>2</sub> from N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, are reversible under more easily obtainable conditions and, therefore, are named as such. In a reversible reaction, the reactants can combine to form products and the products can react to form the reactants. Thus, not only can N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> decompose to form NO<sub>2</sub>, but the NO<sub>2</sub> produced can react to form N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. As soon as the forward reaction produces any NO<sub>2</sub>, the reverse reaction begins and NO<sub>2</sub> starts to react to form N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. At equilibrium, the concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> no longer change because the rate of formation of NO<sub>2</sub> is exactly equal to the rate of consumption of NO<sub>2</sub>, and the rate of formation of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is exactly equal to the rate of consumption of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.  *Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process*: As with the swimmers and the sunbathers, the numbers of each remain constant, yet there is a flux back and forth between them ({'Figure_13_1_dynamic Figure 13.1.dynamic}).

In a chemical equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions do not stop, rather they continue to occur at the same rate, leading to constant concentrations of the reactants and the products. Plots showing how the reaction rates and concentrations change with respect to time are shown in {'Figure_13_1_equilibrium Figure 13.1.equilibrium}.

We can detect a state of equilibrium because the concentrations of reactants and products do not appear to change. However, it is important that we verify that the absence of change is due to equilibrium and not to a reaction rate that is so slow that changes in concentration are difficult to detect.

We use a double arrow when writing an equation for a reversible reaction. Such a reaction may or may not be at equilibrium. For example, {'Figure_13_1_equilibrium Figure 13.1.equilibrium} shows the reaction:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mtext>N</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>4</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">⇌</mo><mn>2</mn><msub><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>

When we wish to speak about one particular component of a reversible reaction, we use a single arrow. For example, in the equilibrium shown in {'Figure_13_1_equilibrium Figure 13.1.equilibrium}, the rate of the forward reaction

is equal to the rate of the backward reaction

Let us consider the evaporation of bromine as a second example of a system at equilibrium.

An equilibrium can be established for a physical change—like this liquid to gas transition—as well as for a chemical reaction. {'Figure_13_1_bromine Figure 13.1.bromine} shows a sample of liquid bromine at equilibrium with bromine vapor in a closed container. When we pour liquid bromine into an empty bottle in which there is no bromine vapor, some liquid evaporates, the amount of liquid decreases, and the amount of vapor increases. If we cap the bottle so no vapor escapes, the amount of liquid and vapor will eventually stop changing and an equilibrium between the liquid and the vapor will be established. If the bottle were not capped, the bromine vapor would escape and no equilibrium would be reached.
