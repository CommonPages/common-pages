name: Key Concepts and Summary

Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and pressure; volume and pressure changes will disturb equilibrium if the number of moles of gas is different on the reactant and product sides of the reaction. The system's response to these disturbances is described by Le Ch√¢telier's principle: The system will respond in a way that counteracts the disturbance. Not all changes to the system result in a disturbance of the equilibrium. Changing pressure or volume will not significantly disturb systems with no gases or with equal numbers of moles of a gas on the reactant and product side.

| Disturbance | Observed Change as Equilibrium is Restored | Direction of Shift | Effect on  *K* |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| reactant added | added reactant is partially consumed | toward products | none |
| product added | added product is partially consumed | toward reactants | none |
| decrease in volume/increase in gas pressure | pressure decreases | toward side with fewer moles of gas | none |
| increase in volume/decrease in gas pressure | pressure increases | toward side with more moles of gas | none |
| temperature increase | heat is absorbed | toward products for endothermic, toward reactants for exothermic | changes |
| temperature decrease | heat is given off | toward reactants for endothermic, toward products for exothermic | changes |
