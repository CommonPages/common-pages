name: Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations from Initial Concentrations

Perhaps the most challenging type of equilibrium calculation can be one in which equilibrium concentrations are derived from initial concentrations and an equilibrium constant. For these calculations, a four-step approach is typically useful:

  1. Identify the direction in which the reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium.
  2. Develop an ICE table.
  3. Calculate the concentration changes and, subsequently, the equilibrium concentrations.
  4. Confirm the calculated equilibrium concentrations.

The last two example exercises of this chapter demonstrate the application of this strategy.
