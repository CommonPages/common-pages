name: Temperature Dependence of Spontaneity

As was previously demonstrated in the section on entropy in an earlier chapter, the spontaneity of a process may depend upon the temperature of the system. Phase transitions, for example, will proceed spontaneously in one direction or the other depending upon the temperature of the substance in question. Likewise, some chemical reactions can also exhibit temperature dependent spontaneities. To illustrate this concept, the equation relating free energy change to the enthalpy and entropy changes for the process is considered:

<math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>H</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>S</mi></mrow></math>

The spontaneity of a process, as reflected in the arithmetic sign of its free energy change, is then determined by the signs of the enthalpy and entropy changes and, in some cases, the absolute temperature. Since  *T* is the absolute (kelvin) temperature, it can only have positive values. Four possibilities therefore exist with regard to the signs of the enthalpy and entropy changes:

  1.  **Both ΔH and ΔS are positive.** This condition describes an endothermic process that involves an increase in system entropy. In this case, Δ *G* will be negative if the magnitude of the  *T*Δ *S* term is greater than Δ *H*. If the  *T*Δ *S* term is less than Δ *H*, the free energy change will be positive. Such a process is  *spontaneous at high temperatures and nonspontaneous at low temperatures.*
  2.  **Both ΔH and ΔS are negative.** This condition describes an exothermic process that involves a decrease in system entropy. In this case, Δ *G* will be negative if the magnitude of the  *T*Δ *S* term is less than Δ *H*. If the  *T*Δ *S* term’s magnitude is greater than Δ *H*, the free energy change will be positive. Such a process is  *spontaneous at low temperatures and nonspontaneous at high temperatures.*
  3.  **ΔH is positive and ΔS is negative.** This condition describes an endothermic process that involves a decrease in system entropy. In this case, Δ *G* will be positive regardless of the temperature. Such a process is  *nonspontaneous at all temperatures.*
  4.  **ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive.** This condition describes an exothermic process that involves an increase in system entropy. In this case, Δ *G* will be negative regardless of the temperature. Such a process is  *spontaneous at all temperatures.*

These four scenarios are summarized in {'Figure_16_4_Scenarios Figure 16.4.Scenarios}.

When considering the conclusions drawn regarding the temperature dependence of spontaneity, it is important to keep in mind what the terms “high” and “low” mean. Since these terms are adjectives, the temperatures in question are deemed high or low relative to some reference temperature. A process that is nonspontaneous at one temperature but spontaneous at another will necessarily undergo a change in “spontaneity” (as reflected by its Δ *G*) as temperature varies. This is clearly illustrated by a graphical presentation of the free energy change equation, in which Δ *G* is plotted on the  *y* axis versus  *T* on the  *x* axis:

Such a plot is shown in {'Figure_16_5_TempSpont Figure 16.5.TempSpont}. A process whose enthalpy and entropy changes are of the same arithmetic sign will exhibit a temperature-dependent spontaneity as depicted by the two yellow lines in the plot. Each line crosses from one spontaneity domain (positive or negative Δ *G*) to the other at a temperature that is characteristic of the process in question. This temperature is represented by the  *x*-intercept of the line, that is, the value of  *T* for which Δ *G* is zero:

So, saying a process is spontaneous at “high” or “low” temperatures means the temperature is above or below, respectively, that temperature at which Δ *G* for the process is zero. As noted earlier, the condition of ΔG = 0 describes a system at equilibrium.
