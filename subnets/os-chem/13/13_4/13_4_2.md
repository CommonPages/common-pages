name: Key Concepts and Summary

The ratios of the rate of change in concentrations of a reaction are equal to the ratios of the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. The sign of the coefficient of x is positive when the concentration increases and negative when it decreases. We learned to approach several basic types of equilibrium problems. When given the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium, we can solve for the equilibrium constant; when given the equilibrium constant and some of the concentrations involved, we can solve for the missing concentrations; and when given the equilibrium constant and the initial concentrations, we can solve for the concentrations at equilibrium. We also learned that a negative value for Δ *G* indicates a spontaneous process; a positive Δ *G* indicates a nonspontaneous process; and a Δ *G* of zero indicates that the system is at equilibrium. We also saw how free energy, spontaneity, and equilibrium relate.
