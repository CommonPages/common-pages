name: Key Concepts and Summary

Calculating values for equilibrium constants and/or equilibrium concentrations is of practical benefit to many applications. A mathematical strategy that uses initial concentrations, changes in concentrations, and equilibrium concentrations (and goes by the acronym ICE) is useful for several types of equilibrium calculations. We also learned that a negative value for Δ *G* indicates a spontaneous process; a positive Δ *G* indicates a nonspontaneous process; and a Δ *G* of zero indicates that the system is at equilibrium. We also saw how free energy, spontaneity, and equilibrium relate.
