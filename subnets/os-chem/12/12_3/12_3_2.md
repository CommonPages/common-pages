The second law of thermodynamics states that a spontaneous process increases the entropy of the universe,  *S*<sub>univ</sub> > 0. If Δ *S*<sub>univ</sub> < 0, the process is nonspontaneous, and if Δ *S*<sub>univ</sub> = 0, the system is at equilibrium. The third law of thermodynamics establishes the zero for entropy as that of a perfect, pure crystalline solid at 0 K. With only one possible microstate, the entropy is zero. We may compute the standard entropy change for a process by using standard entropy values for the reactants and products involved in the process.
