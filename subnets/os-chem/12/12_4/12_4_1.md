name: What’s “Free” about ΔG?

# What’s “Free” about Δ *G*?

In addition to indicating spontaneity, the free energy change also provides information regarding the amount of useful work ( *w*) that may be accomplished by a spontaneous process. Although a rigorous treatment of this subject is beyond the scope of an introductory chemistry text, a brief discussion is helpful for gaining a better perspective on this important thermodynamic property.

For this purpose, consider a spontaneous, exothermic process that involves a decrease in entropy. The free energy, as defined by

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"> <mrow>  <mi>Δ</mi><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Δ</mi><mi>H</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>Δ</mi><mi>S</mi></mrow></math>

may be interpreted as representing the difference between the energy produced by the process, Δ *H*, and the energy lost to the surroundings,  *T*Δ *S*. The difference between the energy produced and the energy lost is the energy available (or “free”) to do useful work by the process, Δ *G*. If the process somehow could be made to take place under conditions of thermodynamic reversibility, the amount of work that could be done would be maximal:

However, as noted previously in this chapter, such conditions are not realistic. In addition, the technologies used to extract work from a spontaneous process (e.g., automobile engine, steam turbine) are never 100% efficient, and so the work done by these processes is always less than the theoretical maximum. Similar reasoning may be applied to a nonspontaneous process, for which the free energy change represents the  *minimum* amount of work that must be done on the system to carry out the process.
