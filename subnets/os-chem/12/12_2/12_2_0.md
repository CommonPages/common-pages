name: Entropy - Introduction

In 1824, at the age of 28, Nicolas Léonard Sadi  **Carnot** ({'Figure_16_3_Carnot Figure 16.3.Carnot}) published the results of an extensive study regarding the efficiency of steam heat engines. In a later review of Carnot’s findings, Rudolf  **Clausius** introduced a new thermodynamic property that relates the spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process to the temperature at which the process takes place. This new property was expressed as the ratio of the  *reversible* heat ( *q*<sub>rev</sub>) and the kelvin temperature ( *T*). The term  **reversible process** refers to a process that takes place at such a slow rate that it is always at equilibrium and its direction can be changed (it can be “reversed”) by an infinitesimally small change is some condition. Note that the idea of a reversible process is a formalism required to support the development of various thermodynamic concepts; no real processes are truly reversible, rather they are classified as  *irreversible*.

Similar to other thermodynamic properties, this new quantity is a state function, and so its change depends only upon the initial and final states of a system. In 1865, Clausius named this property  **entropy (S)** and defined its change for any process as the following:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mrow><mtext>rev</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow><mi>T</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>

The entropy change for a real, irreversible process is then equal to that for the theoretical reversible process that involves the same initial and final states.
