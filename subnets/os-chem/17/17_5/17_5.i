    We should not be surprised that atoms, molecules, or ions must collide before they can react with each other. Atoms must be close together to form chemical bonds. This simple premise is the basis for a very powerful theory that explains many observations regarding chemical kinetics, including factors affecting reaction rates.
    
     **Collision theory** is based on the following postulates:
    
      1. The rate of a reaction is proportional to the rate of reactant collisions: <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>reaction rate</mtext><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>∝</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mo>#</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>collisions</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>time</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>
      2. The reacting species must collide in an orientation that allows contact between the atoms that will become bonded together in the product.
      3. The collision must occur with adequate energy to permit mutual penetration of the reacting species’ valence shells so that the electrons can rearrange and form new bonds (and new chemical species).
    
    We can see the importance of the two physical factors noted in postulates 2 and 3, the orientation and energy of collisions, when we consider the reaction of carbon monoxide with oxygen:
    
    <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>CO(</mtext><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mtext>2</mtext></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mn>2</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mtext>2</mtext></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>
    
    Carbon monoxide is a pollutant produced by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. To reduce this pollutant, automobiles have catalytic converters that use a catalyst to carry out this reaction. It is also a side reaction of the combustion of gunpowder that results in muzzle flash for many firearms. If carbon monoxide and oxygen are present in sufficient quantity, the reaction is spontaneous at high temperature and pressure.
    
    The first step in the gas-phase reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen is a collision between the two molecules:
    
    <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>CO(</mtext><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mtext>2</mtext></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mtext>2</mtext></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mtext>O(</mtext><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>
    
    Although there are many different possible orientations the two molecules can have relative to each other, consider the two presented in {'Figure_12_5_COandO2 Figure 12.5.COandO2}. In the first case, the oxygen side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. In the second case, the carbon side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon dioxide, which has a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>O</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>C</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>O</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> This is a rather simple example of how important the orientation of the collision is in terms of creating the desired product of the reaction.
    
    
            
    
    If the collision does take place with the correct orientation, there is still no guarantee that the reaction will proceed to form carbon dioxide. In addition to a proper orientation, the collision must also occur with sufficient energy to result in product formation.
    
    When reactant species collide with both proper orientation and adequate energy, they combine to form an unstable species called an  **activated complex** or a  **transition state**. As an example, {'Figure_12_5_actcmplx Figure 12.5.actcmplx} depicts the structure of possible transitions states in the reaction between CO and O<sub>2</sub> to form CO<sub>2</sub>.
    
    
            
    
    In most circumstances, it is impossible to isolate or identify a transition state or activated complex. In the reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen to form carbon dioxide, activated complexes have only been observed spectroscopically in systems that utilize a heterogeneous catalyst. The gas-phase reaction occurs too rapidly to isolate any such chemical compound.
    
    Collision theory explains why most reaction rates increase as concentrations increase. With an increase in the concentration of any reacting substance, the chances for collisions between molecules are increased because there are more molecules per unit of volume. More collisions mean a faster reaction rate, assuming the energy of the collisions is adequate.
