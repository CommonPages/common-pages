name: Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation

The minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the  **activation energy (Ea)**. How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a primary factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a large fraction of molecules will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.

{'Figure_12_5_RCooDgm Figure 12.5.RCooDgm} shows how the energy of a chemical system changes as it undergoes a reaction converting reactants to products according to the equation

These  **reaction diagrams** are widely used in chemical kinetics to illustrate various properties of the reaction of interest. Viewing the diagram from left to right, the system initially comprises reactants only,  *A* +  *B*. Reactant molecules with sufficient energy can collide to form a high-energy activated complex or transition state. The unstable transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products,  *C* +  *D*. The diagram depicts the reaction's activation energy,  *Ea*, as the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Using a specific energy, the  *enthalpy* (see chapter on thermochemistry), the enthalpy change of the reaction, Δ *H*, is estimated as the energy difference between the reactants and products. In this case, the reaction is exothermic (Δ *H* < 0) since it yields a decrease in system enthalpy.

The  **Arrhenius equation** relates the activation energy and the rate constant,  *k*, for many chemical reactions:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mtext>−</mtext><msub><mi>E</mi><mtext>a</mtext></msub><mtext>/</mtext><mi>R</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></math>

In this equation,  *R* is the ideal gas constant, which has a value 8.314 J/mol/K, T is temperature on the Kelvin scale,  *E*<sub>a</sub> is the activation energy in joules per mole,  *e* is the constant 2.7183, and  *A* is a constant called the  **frequency factor**, which is related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation of the reacting molecules.

Postulates of collision theory are nicely accommodated by the Arrhenius equation. The frequency factor,  *A*, reflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for  *A* and faster reaction rates.

The exponential term,  *e−Ea/RT*, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in {'Figure_12_5_SuccessR Figure 12.5.SuccessR}( *a*). Two shaded areas under the curve represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy ( *RT*) to overcome the activation barriers ( *Ea*). A lower activation energy results in a greater fraction of adequately energized molecules and a faster reaction.

The exponential term also describes the effect of temperature on reaction rate. A higher temperature represents a correspondingly greater fraction of molecules possessing sufficient energy ( *RT*) to overcome the activation barrier ( *Ea*), as shown in {'Figure_12_5_SuccessR Figure 12.5.SuccessR}( *b*). This yields a greater value for the rate constant and a correspondingly faster reaction rate.

A convenient approach for determining  *E*<sub>a</sub> for a reaction involves the measurement of  *k* at two or more different temperatures and using an alternate version of the Arrhenius equation that takes the form of a linear equation
