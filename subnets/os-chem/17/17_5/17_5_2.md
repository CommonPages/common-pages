name: Key Concepts and Summary

Chemical reactions typically require collisions between reactant species. These reactant collisions must be of proper orientation and sufficient energy in order to result in product formation. Collision theory provides a simple but effective explanation for the effect of many experimental parameters on reaction rates. The Arrhenius equation describes the relation between a reactionâ€™s rate constant, activation energy, temperature, and dependence on collision orientation.
