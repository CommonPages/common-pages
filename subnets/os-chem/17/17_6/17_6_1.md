name: Unimolecular Elementary Reactions

The  **molecularity** of an elementary reaction is the number of reactant species (atoms, molecules, or ions). For example, a  **unimolecular reaction** involves the rearrangement of a  *single* reactant species to produce one or more molecules of product:

The rate equation for a unimolecular reaction is:

A unimolecular reaction may be one of several elementary reactions in a complex mechanism. For example, the reaction:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>3</mn></msub><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo stretchy="false">⟶</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><msub><mtext>O</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mtext>O</mtext></mrow></math>

illustrates a unimolecular elementary reaction that occurs as one part of a two-step reaction mechanism. However, some unimolecular reactions may have only a single reaction in the reaction mechanism. (In other words, an elementary reaction can also be an overall reaction in some cases.) For example, the gas-phase decomposition of cyclobutane, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, to ethylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, occurs via a unimolecular, single-step mechanism:

For these unimolecular reactions to occur, all that is required is the separation of parts of single reactant molecules into products.

Chemical bonds do not simply fall apart during chemical reactions. Energy is required to break chemical bonds. The activation energy for the decomposition of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, for example, is 261 kJ per mole. This means that it requires 261 kilojoules to distort one mole of these molecules into activated complexes that decompose into products:

In a sample of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, a few of the rapidly moving C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> molecules collide with other rapidly moving molecules and pick up additional energy. When the C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> molecules gain enough energy, they can transform into an activated complex, and the formation of ethylene molecules can occur. In effect, a particularly energetic collision knocks a C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> molecule into the geometry of the activated complex. However, only a small fraction of gas molecules travel at sufficiently high speeds with large enough kinetic energies to accomplish this. Hence, at any given moment, only a few molecules pick up enough energy from collisions to react.

The rate of decomposition of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> is directly proportional to its concentration. Doubling the concentration of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> in a sample gives twice as many molecules per liter. Although the fraction of molecules with enough energy to react remains the same, the total number of such molecules is twice as great. Consequently, there is twice as much C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> per liter, and the reaction rate is twice as fast:

A similar relationship applies to any unimolecular elementary reaction; the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and the reaction exhibits first-order behavior. The proportionality constant is the rate constant for the particular unimolecular reaction.
