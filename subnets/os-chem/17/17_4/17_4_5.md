name: Key Concepts and Summary

Integrated rate laws are mathematically derived from differential rate laws, and they describe the time dependence of reactant and product concentrations.

The half-life of a reaction is the time required to decrease the amount of a given reactant by one-half. A reactionâ€™s half-life varies with rate constant and, for some reaction orders, reactant concentration. The half-life of a zero-order reaction decreases as the initial concentration of the reactant in the reaction decreases. The half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of concentration, and the half-life of a second-order reaction decreases as the concentration increases.
