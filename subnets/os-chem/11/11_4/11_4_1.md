name: Mole Fraction and Molality

Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were introduced in an earlier chapter of this text, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications. For example, molarity ( *M*) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations, since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>M</mi><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>mol solute</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>L solution</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary. When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent on temperature. Two such units are  *mole fraction* (introduced in the previous chapter on gases) and  *molality*.

The mole fraction,  *X*, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the total number of moles of all solution components:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mtext>A</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>mol</mtext><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>A</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>total mol of all components</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

By this definition, the sum of mole fractions for all solution components (the solvent and all solutes) is equal to one.

 **Molality** is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>m</mi><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>mol solute</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>kg solvent</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as will be described in this chapter module.
