name: Depression of the Freezing Point of a Solvent

Solutions freeze at lower temperatures than pure liquids. This phenomenon is exploited in “de-icing” schemes that use salt ({'Figure_11_4_rocksalt Figure 11.4.rocksalt}), calcium chloride, or urea to melt ice on roads and sidewalks, and in the use of ethylene glycol as an “antifreeze” in automobile radiators. Seawater freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water, and so the Arctic and Antarctic oceans remain unfrozen even at temperatures below 0 °C (as do the body fluids of fish and other cold-blooded sea animals that live in these oceans).

The decrease in freezing point of a dilute solution compared to that of the pure solvent, Δ *T*<sub>f</sub>, is called the  **freezing point depression** and is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute

where  *m* is the molal concentration of the solute and  *K*<sub>f</sub> is called the  **freezing point depression constant** (or  *cryoscopic constant*). Just as for boiling point elevation constants, these are characteristic properties whose values depend on the chemical identity of the solvent. Values of  *K*<sub>f</sub> for several solvents are listed in .
