name: Boiling Point Elevation

As described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the  *boiling point* of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a solution is lowered due to the presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that the solution’s boiling point will subsequently be increased. Vapor pressure increases with temperature, and so a solution will require a higher temperature than will pure solvent to achieve any given vapor pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere. The increase in boiling point observed when nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, Δ *T*<sub>b</sub>, is called  **boiling point elevation** and is directly proportional to the molal concentration of solute species:

where  *K*<sub>b</sub> is the  **boiling point elevation constant**, or the  *ebullioscopic constant* and  *m* is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute species.

Boiling point elevation constants are characteristic properties that depend on the identity of the solvent. Values of  *K*<sub>b</sub> for several solvents are listed in .

The extent to which the vapor pressure of a solvent is lowered and the boiling point is elevated depends on the total number of solute particles present in a given amount of solvent, not on the mass or size or chemical identities of the particles. A 1  *m* aqueous solution of sucrose (342 g/mol) and a 1  *m* aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (62 g/mol) will exhibit the same boiling point because each solution has one mole of solute particles (molecules) per kilogram of solvent.
