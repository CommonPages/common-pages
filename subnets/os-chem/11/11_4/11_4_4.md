name: Distillation of Solutions

Distillation is a technique for separating the components of mixtures that is widely applied in both in the laboratory and in industrial settings. It is used to refine petroleum, to isolate fermentation products, and to purify water. This separation technique involves the controlled heating of a sample mixture to selectively vaporize, condense, and collect one or more components of interest. A typical apparatus for laboratory-scale distillations is shown in {'Figure_11_4_LabDistill Figure 11.4.LabDistill}.

Oil refineries use large-scale  *fractional distillation* to separate the components of crude oil. The crude oil is heated to high temperatures at the base of a tall  *fractionating column*, vaporizing many of the components that rise within the column. As vaporized components reach adequately cool zones during their ascent, they condense and are collected. The collected liquids are simpler mixtures of hydrocarbons and other petroleum compounds that are of appropriate composition for various applications (e.g., diesel fuel, kerosene, gasoline), as depicted in {'Figure_11_4_refinery Figure 11.4.refinery}.
