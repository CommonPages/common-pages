name: Colligative Properties of Electrolytes

As noted previously in this module, the colligative properties of a solution depend only on the number, not on the kind, of solute species dissolved. For example, 1 mole of any nonelectrolyte dissolved in 1 kilogram of solvent produces the same lowering of the freezing point as does 1 mole of any other nonelectrolyte. However, 1 mole of sodium chloride (an electrolyte) forms  *2 moles* of ions when dissolved in solution. Each individual ion produces the same effect on the freezing point as a single molecule does.

Assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0  *m* aqueous solution of NaCl contains 2.0 mole of ions (1.0 mol Na<sup>+</sup> and 1.0 mol Cl<sup>−</sup>) per each kilogram of water, and its freezing point depression is expected to be

When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured, however, a value of 3.4 °C is obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured and expected colligative property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase. These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in solution.

To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total dissociation, an experimentally measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning German chemist Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff is used. The  **van’t Hoff factor (i)** is defined as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units dissolved:

In 1923, the chemists Peter  **Debye** and Erich  **Hückel** proposed a theory to explain the apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles ({'Figure_11_4_ionpair Figure 11.4.ionpair}). In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the  **activity**, or the effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the actual concentrations. Note that the van’t Hoff factors for the electrolytes in  are for 0.05  *m* solutions, at which concentration the value of  *i* for NaCl is 1.9, as opposed to an ideal value of 2.
