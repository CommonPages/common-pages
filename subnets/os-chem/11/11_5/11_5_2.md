name: Soaps and Detergents

Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, from wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called  *soaps*. The sodium salt of stearic acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Na and contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>— unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the —<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><msup><mrow/><mtext>−</mtext></msup></mrow></math> unit ({'Figure_11_5_soap Figure 11.5.soap}).

 *Detergents* (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, such as C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>25</sub>—, and an ionic group, such as a sulfate—<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>OSO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><msup><mrow/><mtext>−</mtext></msup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> or a sulfonate—<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>SO</mtext></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><msup><mrow/><mtext>−</mtext></msup></mrow></math> ({'Figure_11_5_detrg Figure 11.5.detrg}). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium compounds in hard water; detergents form water-soluble products—a definite advantage for detergents.

The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to, nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted by water (polar), illustrated in {'Figure_11_5_emulsoil Figure 11.5.emulsoil}. As a result, the soap or detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar and polar. Molecules such as this are termed  **amphiphilic** since they have both a hydrophobic (“water-fearing”) part and a hydrophilic (“water-loving”) part. As a consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily washed away.
