name: Interhalogens

Compounds formed from two or more different halogens are  **interhalogens**. Interhalogen molecules consist of one atom of the heavier halogen bonded by single bonds to an odd number of atoms of the lighter halogen. The structures of IF<sub>3</sub>, IF<sub>5</sub>, and IF<sub>7</sub> are illustrated in {'Figure_18_11_IF3IF5IF7 Figure 18.11.IF3IF5IF7}. Formulas for other interhalogens, each of which comes from the reaction of the respective halogens, are in .

Note from  that fluorine is able to oxidize iodine to its maximum oxidation state, 7+, whereas bromine and chlorine, which are more difficult to oxidize, achieve only the 5+-oxidation state. A 7+-oxidation state is the limit for the halogens. Because smaller halogens are grouped about a larger one, the maximum number of smaller atoms possible increases as the radius of the larger atom increases. Many of these compounds are unstable, and most are extremely reactive. The interhalogens react like their component halides; halogen fluorides, for example, are stronger oxidizing agents than are halogen chlorides.

The ionic polyhalides of the alkali metals, such as KI<sub>3</sub>, KICl<sub>2</sub>, KICl<sub>4</sub>, CsIBr<sub>2</sub>, and CsBrCl<sub>2</sub>, which contain an anion composed of at least three halogen atoms, are closely related to the interhalogens. As seen previously, the formation of the polyhalide anion <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mtext>I</mtext><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub><msup><mrow/><mrow><mo>âˆ’</mo></mrow></msup></mrow></math> is responsible for the solubility of iodine in aqueous solutions containing an iodide ion.
