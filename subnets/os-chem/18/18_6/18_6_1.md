The usual method for the preparation of the carbonates of the alkali and alkaline earth metals is by reaction of an oxide or hydroxide with carbon dioxide. Other carbonates form by precipitation. Metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates such as limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), the antacid Tums (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), and baking soda (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) are common examples. Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates decompose in the presence of acids and most decompose on heating.
