name: Key Concepts and Summary

Phosphorus (group 15) commonly exhibits oxidation states of 3âˆ’ with active metals and of 3+ and 5+ with more electronegative nonmetals. The halogens and oxygen will oxidize phosphorus. The oxides are phosphorus(V) oxide, P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, and phosphorus(III) oxide, P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The two common methods for preparing orthophosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, are either the reaction of a phosphate with sulfuric acid or the reaction of water with phosphorus(V) oxide. Orthophosphoric acid is a triprotic acid that forms three types of salts.
