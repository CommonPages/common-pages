name: Key Concepts and Summary

If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction,  *q* for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol Δ *H*, or <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><msubsup><mi>H</mi><mn>298</mn><mo>°</mo></msubsup></mrow></math> for reactions occurring under standard state conditions. The value of Δ *H* for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to Δ *H* for the reaction in the opposite direction, and Δ *H* is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. Examples of enthalpy changes include enthalpy of combustion, enthalpy of fusion, enthalpy of vaporization, and standard enthalpy of formation. The standard enthalpy of formation, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><msubsup><mi>H</mi><mtext>f</mtext><mo>°</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar (standard state). Many of the processes are carried out at 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.
