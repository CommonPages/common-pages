name: Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat

 **Thermal energy** is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules.  **Temperature** is a quantitative measure of “hot” or “cold.” When the atoms and molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is “hot.” When the atoms and molecules are moving slowly, they have lower average KE, and we say that the object is “cold” ({'Figure_5_1_HotCold Figure 5.1.HotCold}). Assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs, increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to decrease.

Most substances expand as their temperature increases and contract as their temperature decreases. This property can be used to measure temperature changes, as shown in {'Figure_5_1_Thermom Figure 5.1.Thermom}. The operation of many thermometers depends on the expansion and contraction of substances in response to temperature changes.

 **Heat (q)** is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L, the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules. Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature ({'Figure_5_1_HeatTrans1 Figure 5.1.HeatTrans1}).

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is called an  **exothermic process**. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process—this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch’s flame ({'Figure_5_1_OxyacTorch Figure 5.1.OxyacTorch}). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an  **endothermic process**. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

Historically, energy was measured in units of  **calories (cal)**. A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A  **joule (J)** is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, which is also called 1 newton–meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The  **heat capacity (C)** of a body of matter is the quantity of heat ( *q*) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change (Δ *T*) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mi>q</mi><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

Heat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property—its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.

For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan is found by observing that it takes 18,150 J of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by 50.0 °C:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mrow><mtext>small pan</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>18,140 J</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>50.0</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>°C</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>363</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>J/°C</mtext></mrow></math>

The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires 90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 °C. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change:

The  **specific heat capacity (c)** of a substance, commonly called its “specific heat,” is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mi>q</mi><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="italics"><mtext>m</mtext></mstyle><mtext>Δ</mtext><mstyle mathvariant="italics"><mtext>T</mtext></mstyle></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

Specific heat capacity depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or releasing heat. It is an intensive property—the type, but not the amount, of the substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mrow><mtext>iron</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>18,140 J</mtext></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>808 g</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>50.0</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>°C</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mtext>0.449 J/g °C</mtext></mrow></math>

The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of iron:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mrow><mtext>iron</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>90,700 J</mtext></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>4040 g</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>50.0</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>°C</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mtext>0.449 J/g °C</mtext></mrow></math>

Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular substance and has units of J/mol °C ({'Figure_5_1_HeatCapacity Figure 5.1.HeatCapacity}).

Liquid water has a relatively high specific heat (about 4.2 J/g °C); most metals have much lower specific heats (usually less than 1 J/g °C). The specific heat of a substance varies somewhat with temperature. However, this variation is usually small enough that we will treat specific heat as constant over the range of temperatures that will be considered in this chapter. Specific heats of some common substances are listed in .

If we know the mass of a substance and its specific heat, we can determine the amount of heat,  *q*, entering or leaving the substance by measuring the temperature change before and after the heat is gained or lost:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mtable columnalign="left"><mtr><mtd><mi>q</mi><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>specific heat</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>mass of substance</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>temperature change</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mi>q</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>c</mi><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mi>m</mi><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>Δ</mtext><mstyle mathvariant="italic"><mtext>T</mtext></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mi>c</mi><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mi>m</mi><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mtext>final</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mtext>initial</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>

In this equation,  *c* is the specific heat of the substance,  *m* is its mass, and Δ *T* (which is read “delta T”) is the temperature change,  *T*<sub>final</sub> −  *T*<sub>initial</sub>. If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is higher than its initial temperature,  *T*<sub>final</sub> −  *T*<sub>initial</sub> has a positive value, and the value of  *q* is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature,  *T*<sub>final</sub> −  *T*<sub>initial</sub> has a negative value, and the value of  *q* is negative.

Note that the relationship between heat, specific heat, mass, and temperature change can be used to determine any of these quantities (not just heat) if the other three are known or can be deduced.
