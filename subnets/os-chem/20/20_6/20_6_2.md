name: Measuring Radiation Exposure

Several different devices are used to detect and measure radiation, including Geiger counters, scintillation counters (scintillators), and radiation dosimeters ({'Figure_21_6_Monitors Figure 21.6.Monitors}). Probably the best-known radiation instrument, the  **Geiger counter** (also called the Geiger-Müller counter) detects and measures radiation. Radiation causes the ionization of the gas in a Geiger-Müller tube. The rate of ionization is proportional to the amount of radiation. A  **scintillation counter** contains a scintillator—a material that emits light (luminesces) when excited by ionizing radiation—and a sensor that converts the light into an electric signal.  **Radiation dosimeters** also measure ionizing radiation and are often used to determine personal radiation exposure. Commonly used types are electronic, film badge, thermoluminescent, and quartz fiber dosimeters.

A variety of units are used to measure various aspects of radiation ({'Figure_21_6_Exposure1 Figure 21.6.Exposure1}). The SI unit for rate of radioactive decay is the  **becquerel (Bq)**, with 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second. The  **curie (Ci)** and  **millicurie (mCi)** are much larger units and are frequently used in medicine (1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7 <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mo>×</mo></math> 10<sup>10</sup> disintegrations per second). The SI unit for measuring radiation dose is the  **gray (Gy)**, with 1 Gy = 1 J of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue. In medical applications, the  **radiation absorbed dose (rad)** is more often used (1 rad = 0.01 Gy; 1 rad results in the absorption of 0.01 J/kg of tissue). The SI unit measuring tissue damage caused by radiation is the  **sievert (Sv)**. This takes into account both the energy and the biological effects of the type of radiation involved in the radiation dose. The  **roentgen equivalent for man (rem)** is the unit for radiation damage that is used most frequently in medicine (100 rem = 1 Sv). Note that the tissue damage units (rem or Sv) includes the energy of the radiation dose (rad or Gy) along with a biological factor referred to as the  **RBE** (for  **relative biological effectiveness**) that is an approximate measure of the relative damage done by the radiation. These are related by:

with RBE approximately 10 for α radiation, 2(+) for protons and neutrons, and 1 for β and γ radiation.
