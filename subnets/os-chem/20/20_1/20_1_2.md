name: Nuclear Stability

A nucleus is stable if it cannot be transformed into another configuration without adding energy from the outside. Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the  **band of stability** (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in {'Figure_21_1_BandStable Figure 21.1.BandStable} represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons (n:p ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead-207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52. This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions, and require larger numbers of neutrons to provide compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic repulsions and hold the nucleus together.

The nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit  **radioactivity**. They change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or  **radioisotope**) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter.

Several observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure. Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see ). Nuclei with certain numbers of nucleons, known as  **magic numbers**, are stable against nuclear decay. These numbers of protons or neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, such as <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msubsup><mrow/><mn>2</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup><mtext>He</mtext><mo>,</mo></mrow></math><math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msubsup><mrow/><mrow><mspace width="0.5em"/><mn>8</mn></mrow><mn>16</mn></msubsup><mtext>O</mtext><mo>,</mo></mrow></math><math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msubsup><mrow/><mn>20</mn><mn>40</mn></msubsup><mtext>Ca</mtext><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><msubsup><mrow/><mrow><mspace width="0.5em"/><mn>82</mn></mrow><mn>208</mn></msubsup><mtext>Pb</mtext><mo>,</mo></mrow></math> are called “double magic” and are particularly stable. These trends in nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook. The details of this model are beyond the scope of this chapter.

The relative stability of a nucleus is correlated with its  **binding energy per nucleon**, the total binding energy for the nucleus divided by the number or nucleons in the nucleus. For instance, we saw in  that the binding energy for a <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><msubsup><mrow/><mn>2</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup><mtext>He</mtext></math> nucleus is 28.4 MeV.

In , we learn how to calculate the binding energy per nucleon of a nuclide on the curve shown in {'Figure_21_1_BindEnergy Figure 21.1.BindEnergy}.
