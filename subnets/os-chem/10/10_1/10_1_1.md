name: Forces between Molecules

Under appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will cause them to form liquids or solids. This is due to intermolecular forces, not  *intra*molecular forces.  *Intra*molecular forces are those  *within* the molecule that keep the molecule together, for example, the bonds between the atoms.  *Inter*molecular forces are the attractions  *between* molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance. {'Figure_10_1_IntravInter Figure 10.1.IntravInter} illustrates these different molecular forces. The strengths of these attractive forces vary widely, though usually the IMFs between small molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces that bond atoms together within a molecule. For example, to overcome the IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it into gaseous HCl requires only about 17 kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl requires about 25 times more energyâ€”430 kilojoules.

All of the attractive forces between neutral atoms and molecules are known as  **van der Waals forces**, although they are usually referred to more informally as intermolecular attraction. We will consider the various types of IMFs in the next three sections of this module.
