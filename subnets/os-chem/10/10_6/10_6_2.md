name: Unit Cells of Metals

The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is referred to as its  **unit cell**. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in {'Figure_10_6_UnitCell1 Figure 10.6.UnitCell1}.

Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in the layer below, as illustrated in {'Figure_10_6_SimpleCub1 Figure 10.6.SimpleCub1}. This arrangement is called  **simple cubic structure**, and the unit cell is called the  **simple cubic unit cell** or primitive cubic unit cell.

In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only “fill” about 52% of the volume of the container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium, Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in {'Figure_10_6_SimpleCub2 Figure 10.6.SimpleCub2}, a solid with this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above; and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its  **coordination number**. For a polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.

In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms, as shown in {'Figure_10_6_SimpleCub3 Figure 10.6.SimpleCub3}. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge length of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit cell contains only the parts of these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit cell has one atom at each of its eight “corners,” there is <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mn>8</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>8</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> atom within one simple cubic unit cell.

Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells: simple cubic (which we have already seen),  **body-centered cubic unit cell**, and  **face-centered cubic unit cell**—all of which are illustrated in {'Figure_10_6_CubUntCll Figure 10.6.CubUntCll}. (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit cells. We leave the more complicated geometries for later in this module.)

Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the center, as shown in {'Figure_10_6_BdyCntrdCb Figure 10.6.BdyCntrdCb}. This is called a  **body-centered cubic (BCC) solid**. Atoms in the corners of a BCC unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains two atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>8</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>8</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> atom from the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom in this structure touches four atoms in the layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC structure has a coordination number of eight.


{image:'Figure_10_6_BdyCntrdCb}
        

Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68% of the total volume. Isomorphous metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature. (Elements or compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be  **isomorphous**.)

Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead, crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and at the centers of each face, as illustrated in {'Figure_10_6_FcCntrdCbc Figure 10.6.FcCntrdCbc}. This arrangement is called a  **face-centered cubic (FCC) solid**. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>8</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>8</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>6</mn><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></math> atoms from the faces). The atoms at the corners touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of the cube. Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.

Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume. This structure is also called  **cubic closest packing (CCP)**. In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination number of 12. The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately obvious, but why they are actually the same structure is illustrated in {'Figure_10_6_CbcCltPckd Figure 10.6.CbcCltPckd}.

Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP, which we have already encountered, and  **hexagonal closest packing (HCP)** shown in {'Figure_10_6_ClstPckng2 Figure 10.6.ClstPckng2}. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP, atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers (i.e., ABABAB⋯). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABC⋯). About two–thirds of all metals crystallize in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of 12. Metals that crystallize in an HCP structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a CCP structure include Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt.

In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of three axes ( *a*,  *b*, and  *c*) and the angles ( *α*,  *β*, and  *γ*) between them, as illustrated in {'Figure_10_6_GenUnitCll Figure 10.6.GenUnitCll}. The axes are defined as being the lengths between points in the space lattice. Consequently, unit cell axes join points with identical environments.


{image:'Figure_10_6_GenUnitCll}
        

There are seven different lattice systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of fourteen different unit cells, which have the shapes shown in {'Figure_10_6_CrystalSys Figure 10.6.CrystalSys}.
