name: Calculating Formal Charge

The  **formal charge** of an atom in a molecule is the  *hypothetical* charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.

Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mtext>formal charge</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext># valence shell electrons (free atom)</mtext><mo>−</mo><mtext># lone pair electrons</mtext><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>−</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext># bonding electrons</mtext></mrow></math>

We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.

We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the  *actual* charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.
