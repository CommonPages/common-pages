name: Electronic Structures of Anions

Most monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to completely fill its outer  *s* and  *p* orbitals, thereby reaching the electron configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to determine the charge on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must be gained to fill the  *s* and  *p* orbitals of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example, has the electron configuration 1 *s*<sup>2</sup>2 *s*<sup>2</sup>2 *p*<sup>4</sup>, whereas the oxygen anion has the electron configuration of the noble gas neon (Ne), 1 *s*<sup>2</sup>2 *s*<sup>2</sup>2 *p*<sup>6</sup>. The two additional electrons required to fill the valence orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2– (O<sup>2–</sup>).
