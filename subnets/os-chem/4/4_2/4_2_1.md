name: Formation of Covalent Bonds

Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the hydrogen molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. {'Figure_7_2_Morse Figure 7.2.Morse} illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the  *x*-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the  *x*-axis), their valence orbitals (1 *s*) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The  **bond length** is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.
