name: Lewis Symbols

We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic ions. A  **Lewis symbol** consists of an elemental symbol surrounded by one dot for each of its valence electrons:

{'Figure_7_3_3rowLewis Figure 7.3.3rowLewis} shows the Lewis symbols for the elements of the third period of the periodic table.

Lewis symbols can also be used to illustrate the formation of cations from atoms, as shown here for sodium and calcium:

Likewise, they can be used to show the formation of anions from atoms, as shown here for chlorine and sulfur:

{'Figure_7_3_IonLewis Figure 7.3.IonLewis} demonstrates the use of Lewis symbols to show the transfer of electrons during the formation of ionic compounds.
