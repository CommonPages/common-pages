The values that divide a rank-ordered set of data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. Percentiles are used to compare and interpret data. For example, an observation at the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile would be greater than 50 percent of the other obeservations in the set. Quartiles divide data into quarters. The first quartile ( *Q*<sub>1</sub>) is the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile,the second quartile ( *Q*<sub>2</sub> or median) is 50<sup>th</sup> percentile, and the third quartile ( *Q*<sub>3</sub>) is the the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. The interquartile range, or  *IQR*, is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values. The  *IQR* is found by subtracting  *Q*<sub>1</sub> from  *Q*<sub>3</sub>, and can help determine outliers by using the following two expressions.

  *  *Q*<sub>3</sub> +  *IQR*(1.5)
  *  *Q*<sub>1</sub> â€“  *IQR*(1.5)
