A  *histogram* is a graphic version of a frequency distribution. The graph consists of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other. The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values and the vertical scale represents frequencies. The heights of the bars correspond to frequency values. Histograms are typically used for large, continuous, quantitative data sets. A frequency polygon can also be used when graphing large data sets with data points that repeat. The data usually goes on  *y*-axis with the frequency being graphed on the  *x*-axis. Time series graphs can be helpful when looking at large amounts of data for one variable over a period of time.
