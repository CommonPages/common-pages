name: Measures of the Spread of the Data - Introduction

An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The  **standard deviation** is a number that measures how far data values are from their mean.
