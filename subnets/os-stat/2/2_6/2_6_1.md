Looking at the distribution of data can reveal a lot about the relationship between the mean, the median, and the mode. There are  *three types of distributions. A right (or positive) skewed*distribution has a shape like {'fig-ch02_8_2 fig-ch02.8.2}. A  **left (or negative) skewed** distribution has a shape like {'fig-ch02_8_3 fig-ch02.8.3}. A  **symmetrical** distrubtion looks like {'fig-ch02_8_1 fig-ch02.8.1}.
