name: Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms - Introduction

The science of  **statistics** deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of  **data**. We see and use data in our everyday lives. 

In this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called  **descriptive statistics**. Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from "good" data. The formal methods are called  **inferential statistics**. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.

Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life.
