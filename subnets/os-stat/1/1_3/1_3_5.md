Some calculations generate numbers that are artificially precise. It is not necessary to report a value to eight decimal places when the measures that generated that value were only accurate to the nearest tenth. Round off your final answer to one more decimal place than was present in the original data. This means that if you have data measured to the nearest tenth of a unit, report the final statistic to the nearest hundredth.

In addition to rounding your answers, you can measure your data using the following four levels of measurement.

  *  *Nominal scale level:* data that cannot be ordered nor can it be used in calculations
  *  *Ordinal scale level:* data that can be ordered; the differences cannot be measured
  *  *Interval scale level:* data with a definite ordering but no starting point; the differences can be measured, but there is no such thing as a ratio.
  *  *Ratio scale level:* data with a starting point that can be ordered; the differences have meaning and ratios can be calculated.

When organizing data, it is important to know how many times a value appears. How many statistics students study five hours or more for an exam? What percent of families on our block own two pets? Frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency are measures that answer questions like these.
