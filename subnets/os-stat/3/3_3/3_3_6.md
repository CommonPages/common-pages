 *Use the following information to answer the next ten exercises.* Forty-eight percent of all Californians registered voters prefer life in prison without parole over the death penalty for a person convicted of first degree murder. Among Latino California registered voters, 55% prefer life in prison without parole over the death penalty for a person convicted of first degree murder. 37.6% of all Californians are Latino.

In this problem, let:


  *  *C* = Californians (registered voters) preferring life in prison without parole over the death penalty for a person convicted of first degree murder.
  *  *L* = Latino Californians

Suppose that one Californian is randomly selected.
