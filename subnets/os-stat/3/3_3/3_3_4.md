The multiplication rule and the addition rule are used for computing the probability of  *A* and  *B*, as well as the probability of  *A* or  *B* for two given events  *A*,  *B* defined on the sample space. In sampling with replacement each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered to be not independent. The events  *A* and  *B* are mutually exclusive events when they do not have any outcomes in common.
