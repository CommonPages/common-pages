name: Mutually Exclusive Events

 *A* and  *B* are  **mutually exclusive** events if they cannot occur at the same time. This means that  *A* and  *B* do not share any outcomes and  *P*( *A* AND  *B*) = 0.

For example, suppose the sample space  *S* = &#123;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#125;. Let  *A* = &#123;1, 2, 3, 4, 5&#125;,  *B* = &#123;4, 5, 6, 7, 8&#125;, and  *C* = &#123;7, 9&#125;.  *A* AND  *B* = &#123;4, 5&#125;.  *P*( *A* AND  *B*) = <math xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:cnxorg="http://cnx.rice.edu/system-info" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math> and is not equal to zero. Therefore,  *A* and  *B* are not mutually exclusive.  *A* and  *C* do not have any numbers in common so  *P*( *A* AND  *C*) = 0. Therefore,  *A* and  *C* are mutually exclusive.

If it is not known whether  *A* and  *B* are mutually exclusive,  *assume they are not until you can show otherwise*. The following examples illustrate these definitions and terms.
