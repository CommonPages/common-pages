A statistical experiment can be classified as a binomial experiment if the following conditions are met:

  1. There are a fixed number of trials,  *n*.
  2. There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and, "failure" for each trial. The letter  *p* denotes the probability of a success on one trial and  *q* denotes the probability of a failure on one trial.
  3. The  *n* trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.

The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable  *X* = the number of successes obtained in the  *n* independent trials. The mean of  *X* can be calculated using the formula  *μ* =  *np*, and the standard deviation is given by the formula σ = <math xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:cnxorg="http://cnx.rice.edu/system-info" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"> <mrow><mtext> </mtext><msqrt>   <mrow>    <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi>   </mrow>  </msqrt> </mrow></math>.
