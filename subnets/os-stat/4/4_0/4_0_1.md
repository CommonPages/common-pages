name: Random Variable Notation

Upper case letters such as  *X* or  *Y* denote a random variable. Lower case letters like  *x* or  *y* denote the value of a random variable. If   *X is a random variable, then X is written in words, and x is given as a number.*

For example, let  *X* = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. The sample space for the toss of three fair coins is  *TTT*;  *THH*;  *HTH*;  *HHT*;  *HTT*;  *THT*;  *TTH*;  *HHH*. Then,  *x* = 0, 1, 2, 3.  *X* is in words and  *x* is a number. Notice that for this example, the  *x* values are countable outcomes. Because you can count the possible values that  *X* can take on and the outcomes are random (the  *x* values 0, 1, 2, 3),  *X* is a discrete random variable.
