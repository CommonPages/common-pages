name: Notation for the Hypergeometric: H = Hypergeometric Probability Distribution Function

 *X* ~  *H*( *r*,  *b*,  *n*)

Read this as " *X* is a random variable with a hypergeometric distribution." The parameters are  *r*,  *b*, and  *n*;  *r* = the size of the group of interest (first group),  *b* = the size of the second group,  *n* = the size of the chosen sample.
