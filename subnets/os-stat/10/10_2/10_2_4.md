 *Use the following information to answer the next five exercises.* The mean speeds of fastball pitches from two different baseball pitchers are to be compared. A sample of 14 fastball pitches is measured from each pitcher. The populations have normal distributions.  shows the result. Scouters believe that Rodriguez pitches a speedier fastball.


| Pitcher | Sample Mean Speed of Pitches (mph) | Population Standard Deviation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Wesley | 86 | 3 |
| Rodriguez | 91 | 7 |
    

 *Use the following information to answer the next five exercises.* A researcher is testing the effects of plant food on plant growth. Nine plants have been given the plant food. Another nine plants have not been given the plant food. The heights of the plants are recorded after eight weeks. The populations have normal distributions. The following table is the result. The researcher thinks the food makes the plants grow taller.


| Plant Group | Sample Mean Height of Plants (inches) | Population Standard Deviation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Food | 16 | 2.5 |
| No food | 14 | 1.5 |
    

 *Use the following information to answer the next five exercises.* Two metal alloys are being considered as material for ball bearings. The mean melting point of the two alloys is to be compared. 15 pieces of each metal are being tested. Both populations have normal distributions. The following table is the result. It is believed that Alloy Zeta has a different melting point.


|  | Sample Mean Melting Temperatures (Â°F) | Population Standard Deviation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Alloy Gamma | 800 | 95 |
| Alloy Zeta | 900 | 105 |
