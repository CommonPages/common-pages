 *Use the following information for the next five exercises.* Two types of phone operating system are being tested to determine if there is a difference in the proportions of system failures (crashes). Fifteen out of a random sample of 150 phones with OS<sub>1</sub> had system failures within the first eight hours of operation. Nine out of another random sample of 150 phones with OS<sub>2</sub> had system failures within the first eight hours of operation. OS<sub>2</sub> is believed to be more stable (have fewer crashes) than OS<sub>1</sub>.

 *Use the following information to answer the next twelve exercises.* In the recent Census, three percent of the U.S. population reported being of two or more races. However, the percent varies tremendously from state to state. Suppose that two random surveys are conducted. In the first random survey, out of 1,000 North Dakotans, only nine people reported being of two or more races. In the second random survey, out of 500 Nevadans, 17 people reported being of two or more races. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the population percents are the same for the two states or if the percent for Nevada is statistically higher than for North Dakota.
