In , the first two columns are the third-exam and final-exam data. The third column shows the predicted  *ŷ* values calculated from the line of best fit:  *ŷ* = –173.5 + 4.83 *x*. The residuals, or errors, have been calculated in the fourth column of the table: observed  *y* value−predicted y value =  *y* −  *ŷ*.

 *s* is the standard deviation of all the  *y* −  *ŷ* =  *ε* values where  *n* = the total number of data points. If each residual is calculated and squared, and the results are added, we get the SSE. The standard deviation of the residuals is calculated from the SSE as:

Rather than calculate the value of  *s* ourselves, we can find  *s* using the computer or calculator. For this example, the calculator function LinRegTTest found  *s* = 16.4 as the standard deviation of the residuals

We are looking for all data points for which the residual is greater than 2 *s* = 2(16.4) = 32.8 or less than –32.8. Compare these values to the residuals in column four of the table. The only such data point is the student who had a grade of 65 on the third exam and 175 on the final exam; the residual for this student is 35.
