To determine if a point is an outlier, do one of the following:
        

  1. Input the following equations into the TI 83, 83+,84, 84+:                                                                                                    y                1                              =a+bx                                                                                                             y                2                              =a+bx+2s                                                                                                             y                3                              =a+bxâˆ’2s                                                                       where s is the standard deviation of the residualsIf any point is above y2 or below y3 then the point is considered to be an outlier.
  2. Use the residuals and compare their absolute values to 2 *s* where  *s* is the standard deviation of the residuals. If the absolute value of any residual is greater than or equal to 2 *s*, then the corresponding point is an outlier.
  3. Note: The calculator function LinRegTTest (STATS TESTS LinRegTTest) calculates  *s*.
