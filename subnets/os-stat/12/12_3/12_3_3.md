# The Correlation Coefficient  *r*

Besides looking at the scatter plot and seeing that a line seems reasonable, how can you tell if the line is a good predictor? Use the correlation coefficient as another indicator (besides the scatterplot) of the strength of the relationship between  *x* and  *y*.

The  *correlation coefficient, r,* developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is numerical and provides a measure of strength and direction of the linear association between the independent variable  *x* and the dependent variable  *y*.


The correlation coefficient is calculated as

where  *n* = the number of data points.

If you suspect a linear relationship between  *x* and  *y*, then  *r* can measure how strong the linear relationship is.

## What the VALUE of  *r* tells us:

  * The value of  *r* is always between –1 and +1: –1 ≤  *r* ≤ 1.
  * The size of the correlation  *r* indicates the strength of the linear relationship between  *x* and  *y*. Values of  *r* close to –1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between  *x* and  *y*.
  * If  *r* = 0 there is likely no linear correlation. It is important to view the scatterplot, however, because data that exhibit a curved or horizontal pattern may have a correlation of 0.
  * If  *r* = 1, there is perfect positive correlation. If  *r* = –1, there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all of the original data points lie on a straight line. Of course,in the real world, this will not generally happen.

## What the SIGN of  *r* tells us

  * A positive value of  *r* means that when  *x* increases,  *y* tends to increase and when  *x* decreases,  *y* tends to decrease  *(positive correlation)*.
  * A negative value of  *r* means that when  *x* increases,  *y* tends to decrease and when  *x* decreases,  *y* tends to increase  *(negative correlation)*.
  * The sign of  *r* is the same as the sign of the slope,  *b*, of the best-fit line.
