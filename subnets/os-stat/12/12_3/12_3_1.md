name: Least Squares Criteria for Best Fit

The process of fitting the best-fit line is called  *linear regression*. The idea behind finding the best-fit line is based on the assumption that the data are scattered about a straight line. The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible. Any other line you might choose would have a higher SSE than the best fit line. This best fit line is called the  *least-squares regression line*.

## THIRD EXAM vs FINAL EXAM EXAMPLE:


The graph of the line of best fit for the third-exam/final-exam example is as follows:

The least squares regression line (best-fit line) for the third-exam/final-exam example has the equation:
