A regression line, or a line of best fit, can be drawn on a scatter plot and used to predict outcomes for the  *x* and  *y* variables in a given data set or sample data. There are several ways to find a regression line, but usually the least-squares regression line is used because it creates a uniform line. Residuals, also called “errors,” measure the distance from the actual value of  *y* and the estimated value of  *y*. The Sum of Squared Errors, when set to its minimum, calculates the points on the line of best fit. Regression lines can be used to predict values within the given set of data, but should not be used to make predictions for values outside the set of data.

The correlation coefficient  *r* measures the strength of the linear association between  *x* and  *y*. The variable  *r* has to be between –1 and +1. When  *r* is positive, the  *x* and  *y* will tend to increase and decrease together. When  *r* is negative,  *x* will increase and  *y* will decrease, or the opposite,  *x* will decrease and  *y* will increase. The coefficient of determination  *r*<sup>2</sup>, is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient. When expressed as a percent,  *r*<sup>2</sup> represents the percent of variation in the dependent variable  *y* that can be explained by variation in the independent variable  *x* using the regression line.
