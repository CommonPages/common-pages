name: The Coefficient of Determination

 *The variable r2 is called the* **coefficient of determination** and is the square of the correlation coefficient, but is usually stated as a percent, rather than in decimal form. It has an interpretation in the context of the data:

  * <math xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:cnxorg="http://cnx.rice.edu/system-info" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>, when expressed as a percent, represents the percent of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable  *y* that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable  *x* using the regression (best-fit) line.
  * 1 – <math xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:cnxorg="http://cnx.rice.edu/system-info" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><msup> <mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>, when expressed as a percentage, represents the percent of variation in  *y* that is NOT explained by variation in  *x* using the regression line. This can be seen as the scattering of the observed data points about the regression line.

Consider the  introduced in the previous section

  * The line of best fit is:  *ŷ* = –173.51 + 4.83x
  * The correlation coefficient is  *r* = 0.6631
  * The coefficient of determination is  *r*<sup>2</sup> = 0.6631<sup>2</sup> = 0.4397
  *  *Interpretation of r2 in the context of this example:*
  * Approximately 44% of the variation (0.4397 is approximately 0.44) in the final-exam grades can be explained by the variation in the grades on the third exam, using the best-fit regression line.
  * Therefore, approximately 56% of the variation (1 – 0.44 = 0.56) in the final exam grades can NOT be explained by the variation in the grades on the third exam, using the best-fit regression line. (This is seen as the scattering of the points about the line.)
