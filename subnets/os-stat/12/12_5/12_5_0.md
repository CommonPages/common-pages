name: Prediction - Introduction

Recall the .

We examined the scatterplot and showed that the correlation coefficient is significant. We found the equation of the best-fit line for the final exam grade as a function of the grade on the third-exam. We can now use the least-squares regression line for prediction.

Suppose you want to estimate, or predict, the mean final exam score of statistics students who received 73 on the third exam. The exam scores  *(x-values)* range from 65 to 75.  *Since 73 is between the x-values 65 and 75*, substitute  *x* = 73 into the equation. Then:

We predict that statistics students who earn a grade of 73 on the third exam will earn a grade of 179.08 on the final exam, on average.
