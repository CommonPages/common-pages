Scatter plots are particularly helpful graphs when we want to see if there is a linear relationship among data points. They indicate both the direction of the relationship between the  *x* variables and the  *y* variables, and the strength of the relationship. We calculate the strength of the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable using linear regression.
