name: THIRD-EXAM vs FINAL-EXAM EXAMPLE: critical value method

Consider the .
The line of best fit is:  *ŷ* = –173.51+4.83 *x*  with  *r* = 0.6631 and there are  *n* = 11 data points. Can the regression line be used for prediction?  *Given a third-exam score (x value), can we use the line to predict the final exam score (predicted y value)?*

  *  *H0*:  *ρ* = 0
  *   *Ha*:  *ρ* ≠ 0 
  *  *α* = 0.05

  * Use the "95% Critical Value" table for  *r* with  *df* =  *n* – 2 = 11 – 2 = 9.
  * The critical values are –0.602 and +0.602
  * Since 0.6631 > 0.602,  *r* is significant.
  * Decision: Reject the null hypothesis.
  * Conclusion:There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant  linear relationship between the third exam score ( *x*) and the final exam score ( *y*) because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.

 *Because r is significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the regression line can be used to predict final exam scores.*
