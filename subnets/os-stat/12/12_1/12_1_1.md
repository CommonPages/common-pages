# Slope and  *Y*-Intercept of a Linear Equation

For the linear equation  *y* =  *a* +  *bx*,  *b* = slope and  *a* =  *y*-intercept. From algebra recall that the slope is a number that describes the steepness of a line, and the  *y*-intercept is the  *y* coordinate of the point (0,  *a*) where the line crosses the  *y*-axis.
