name: Using the Normal Distribution - Introduction

The shaded area in the following graph indicates the area to the left of  *x*. This area is represented by the probability  *P*( *X* <  *x*). Normal tables, computers, and calculators provide or calculate the probability  *P*( *X* <  *x*).

The area to the right is then 
 *P*(
 *X* > 
 *x*) = 1 – 
 *P*(
 *X* < 
 *x*). Remember, 
 *P*(
 *X* < 
 *x*) = 
 **Area to the left** of the vertical line through 
 *x*. 
 *P*(
 *X* > 
 *x*) = 1 – 
 *P*(
 *X* < 
 *x*) = 
 **Area to the right** of the vertical line through 
 *x*. 
 *P*(
 *X* < 
 *x*) is the same as 
 *P*(
 *X* ≤ 
 *x*) and 
 *P*(
 *X* > 
 *x*) is the same as 
 *P*(
 *X* ≥ 
 *x*) for continuous distributions.
