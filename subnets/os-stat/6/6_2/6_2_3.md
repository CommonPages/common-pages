The normal distribution, which is continuous, is the most important of all the probability distributions. Its graph is bell-shaped. This bell-shaped curve is used in almost all disciplines. Since it is a continuous distribution, the total area under the curve is one.  The parameters of the normal are the mean  *µ* and the standard deviation  *σ*. A special normal distribution, called the standard normal distribution is the distribution of  *z*-scores. Its mean is zero, and its standard deviation is one.
