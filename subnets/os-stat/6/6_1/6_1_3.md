A  *z*-score is a standardized value. Its distribution is the standard normal,  *Z* ~  *N*(0, 1). The mean of the  *z*-scores is zero and the standard deviation is one. If  *z* is the  *z*-score for a value  *x* from the normal distribution  *N*( *µ*,  *σ*) then  *z* tells you how many standard deviations  *x* is above (greater than) or below (less than)  *µ*.
