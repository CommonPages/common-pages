#  *Z*-Scores

If  *X* is a normally distributed random variable and  *X* ~  *N(μ, σ)*, then the  *z*-score is:

<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"> <mrow>  <mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>x</mi><mtext> </mtext><mo>–</mo><mtext> </mtext><mi>μ</mi>   </mrow>   <mi>σ</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math>

 *The z-score tells you how many standard deviations the value x is above (to the right of) or below (to the left of) the mean, μ.* Values of  *x* that are larger than the mean have positive  *z*-scores, and values of  *x* that are smaller than the mean have negative  *z*-scores. If  *x* equals the mean, then  *x* has a  *z*-score of zero.

## The Empirical Rule

If  *X* is a random variable and has a normal distribution with mean  *µ* and standard deviation  *σ*, then the  **Empirical Rule** states the following:

  * About 68% of the  *x* values lie between –1 *σ* and +1 *σ* of the mean  *µ* (within one standard deviation of the mean).
  * About  95% of the  *x* values lie between –2 *σ* and +2 *σ* of the mean  *µ* (within two standard deviations of the mean).
  * About 99.7% of the  *x* values lie between –3 *σ* and +3 *σ* of the mean  *µ* (within three standard deviations of the mean). Notice that almost all the  *x* values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.
  * The  *z*-scores for +1 *σ* and –1 *σ* are +1 and –1, respectively.
  * The  *z*-scores for +2 *σ*  and –2 *σ* are +2 and –2, respectively.
  * The  *z*-scores for +3 *σ*  and –3 *σ* are +3 and –3 respectively.

The empirical rule is also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule.
