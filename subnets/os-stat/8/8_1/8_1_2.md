name: Working Backwards to Find the Error Bound or Sample Mean

When we calculate a confidence interval, we find the sample mean, calculate the error bound, and use them to calculate the confidence interval. However, sometimes when we read statistical studies, the study may state the confidence interval only. If we know the confidence interval, we can work backwards to find both the error bound and the sample mean.

  * From the upper value for the interval, subtract the sample mean,
  * OR, from the upper value for the interval, subtract the lower value.  Then divide the difference by two.

  * Subtract the error bound from the upper value of the confidence interval,
  * OR, average the upper and lower endpoints of the confidence interval.

Notice that there are two methods to perform each calculation. You can choose the method that is easier to use with the information you know.
