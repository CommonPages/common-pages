In this module, we learned how to calculate the confidence interval for a single population mean where the population standard deviation is known. When estimating a population mean, the margin of error is called the error bound for a population mean ( *EBM*). A confidence interval has the general form:

(lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate –  *EBM*, point estimate +  *EBM*)

The calculation of  *EBM* depends on the size of the sample and the level of confidence desired. The confidence level is the percent of all possible samples that can be expected to include the true population parameter. As the confidence level increases, the corresponding  *EBM* increases as well. As the sample size increases, the  *EBM* decreases. By the central limit theorem,

Given a confidence interval, you can work backwards to find the error bound ( *EBM*) or the sample mean. To find the error bound, find the difference of the upper bound of the interval and the mean. If you do not know the sample mean, you can find the error bound by calculating half the difference of the upper and lower bounds.  To find the sample mean given a confidence interval, find the difference of the upper bound and the error bound. If the error bound is unknown, then average the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval to find the sample mean.

Sometimes researchers know in advance that they want to estimate a population mean within a specific margin of error for a given level of confidence. In that case, solve the  *EBM* formula for  *n* to discover the size of the sample that is needed to achieve this goal:
