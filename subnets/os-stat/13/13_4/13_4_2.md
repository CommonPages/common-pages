The  *F* test for the equality of two variances rests heavily on the assumption of normal distributions. The test is unreliable if this assumption is not met. If both distributions are normal, then the ratio of the two sample variances is distributed as an  *F* statistic, with numerator and denominator degrees of freedom that are one less than the samples sizes of the corresponding two groups. A  *test of two variances* hypothesis test determines if two variances are the same. The distribution for the hypothesis test is the  *F* distribution with two different degrees of freedom.

  1. The populations from which the two samples are drawn are normally distributed.
  2. The two populations are independent of each other.
