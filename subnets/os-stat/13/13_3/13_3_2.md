The graph of the  *F* distribution is always positive and skewed right, though the shape can be mounded or exponential depending on the combination of numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. The  *F* statistic is the ratio of a measure of the variation in the group means to a similar measure of the variation within the groups. If the null hypothesis is correct, then the numerator should be small compared to the denominator. A small  *F* statistic will result, and the area under the  *F* curve to the right will be large, representing a large  *p*-value. When the null hypothesis of equal group means is incorrect, then the numerator should be large compared to the denominator, giving a large  *F* statistic and a small area (small  *p*-value) to the right of the statistic under the  *F* curve.

When the data have unequal group sizes (unbalanced data), then techniques from <link:> need to be used for hand calculations. In the case of balanced data (the groups are the same size) however, simplified calculations based on group means and variances may be used. In practice, of course, software is usually employed in the analysis. As in any analysis, graphs of various sorts should be used in conjunction with numerical techniques. Always look of your data!
