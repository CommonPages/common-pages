name: Facts About the F Distribution - Introduction

 *Here are some facts about the F distribution.*

  1. The curve is not symmetrical but skewed to the right.
  2. There is a different curve for each set of  *df*s.
  3. The  *F* statistic is greater than or equal to zero.
  4. As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and for the denominator get larger, the curve approximates the normal.
  5. Other uses for the  *F* distribution include comparing two variances and two-way Analysis of Variance. Two-Way Analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter.
