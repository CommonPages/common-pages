name: One-Way ANOVA - Introduction

The purpose of a one-way ANOVA test is to determine the existence of a statistically significant difference among several group means. The test actually uses  **variances** to help determine if the means are equal or not. In order to perform a one-way ANOVA test, there are five basic  *assumptions* to be fulfilled:

  1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.
  2. All samples are randomly selected and independent.
  3.  The populations are assumed to have  **equal standard deviations**  *(or variances)*.
  4. The factor is a categorical variable.
  5. The response is a numerical variable.
