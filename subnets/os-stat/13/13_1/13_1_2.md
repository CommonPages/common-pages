Analysis of variance extends the comparison of two groups to several, each a level of a categorical variable (factor). Samples from each group are independent, and must be randomly selected from normal populations with equal variances. We test the null hypothesis of equal means of the response in every group versus the alternative hypothesis of one or more group means being different from the others. A one-way ANOVA hypothesis test determines if several population means are equal. The distribution for the test is the  *F* distribution with two different degrees of freedom.

  1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.
  2. All samples are randomly selected and independent.
  3. The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances).
