In order for a hypothesis testâ€™s results to be generalized to a population, certain requirements must be satisfied. 

When testing for a single population mean:

  1. A Student's  *t*-test should be used if the data come from a simple, random sample and the population is approximately normally distributed, or the sample size is large, with an unknown standard deviation.
  2. The normal test will work if the data come from a simple, random sample and the population       is approximately normally distributed, or the sample size is large, with a known standard       deviation.

When testing a single population proportion use a normal test for a single population proportion if the data comes from a simple, random sample, fill the requirements for a binomial distribution, and the mean number of success and the mean number of failures satisfy the conditions:  *np* > 5 and  *nq* >  *n* where  *n* is the sample size,  *p* is the probability of a success, and  *q* is the probability of a failure.
