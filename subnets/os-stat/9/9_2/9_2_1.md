In every hypothesis test, the outcomes are dependent on a correct interpretation of the data. Incorrect calculations or misunderstood summary statistics can yield errors that affect the results. A  *Type I* error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected. A  *Type II error* occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected.

The probabilities of these errors are denoted by the Greek letters  *α* and  *β*, for a Type I and a Type II error respectively. The power of the test, 1 –  *β*, quantifies the likelihood that a test will yield the correct result of a true alternative hypothesis being accepted. A high power is desirable.
