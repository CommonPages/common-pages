When the probability of an event occurring is low, and it happens, it is called a rare event. Rare events are important to consider in hypothesis testing because they can inform your willingness not to reject or to reject a null hypothesis. To test a null hypothesis, find the  *p*-value for the sample data and graph the results. When deciding whether or not to reject the null the hypothesis, keep these two parameters in mind:


  1.  *α* >  *p*-value, reject the null hypothesis
  2.  *α* ≤  *p*-value, do not reject the null hypothesis
