name: Using the Sample to Test the Null Hypothesis

Use the sample data to calculate the actual probability of getting the test result, called the  **p-value**. The  *p*-value is the  *probability that, if the null hypothesis is true, the results from another randomly selected sample will be as extreme or more extreme as the results obtained from the given sample.*

A large  *p*-value calculated from the data indicates that we should not reject the  **null hypothesis**. The smaller the  *p*-value, the more unlikely the outcome, and the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis. We would reject the null hypothesis if the evidence is strongly against it.

 *Draw a graph that shows the p-value. The hypothesis test is easier to perform if you use a graph because you see the problem more clearly.*
