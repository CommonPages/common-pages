name: Decision and Conclusion

A systematic way to make a decision of whether to reject or not reject the  **null hypothesis**
is to compare the  *p*-value and a  *preset or preconceived α (also called a "significance level")*. A preset  *α* is the probability of a  **Type I error** (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the problem.

When you make a  *decision* to reject or not reject  *H0*, do as follows:


  * If  *α* >  *p*-value, reject  *H0*. The results of the sample data are significant. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that  *H0* is an incorrect belief and that the  *alternative hypothesis*,  *Ha*, may be correct.
  * If  *α* ≤  *p*-value, do not reject  *H0*. The results of the sample data are not significant.There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis, *Ha*, may be correct.
  * When you "do not reject  *H0*", it does not mean that you should believe that  *H0* is true. It simply means that the sample data have  *failed* to provide sufficient evidence to cast serious doubt about the truthfulness of  *Ho*.

 *Conclusion:* After you make your decision, write a thoughtful  *conclusion* about the hypotheses in terms of the given problem.
