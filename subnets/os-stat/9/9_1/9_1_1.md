In a  *hypothesis test*, sample data is evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we:




  1. Evaluate the  *null hypothesis*, typically denoted with  *H0*. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤ or ≥)
  2. Always write the  *alternative hypothesis*, typically denoted with  *Ha* or  *H1*, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (≠, >, or <).
  3. If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
  4. Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties.
