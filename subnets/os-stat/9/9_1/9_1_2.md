 *H0* and  *Ha* are contradictory.


|  *If Ho has:* | equal (=) | greater than or equal to (≥) | less than or equal to (≤) |
|  *then Ha has:* | not equal (≠)  *or* greater than (>)  *or* less than (<) | less than (<) | greater than (>) |
    

If  *α* ≤  *p*-value, then do not reject  *H0*.

If  *α* >  *p*-value, then reject  *H0*.

 *α* is preconceived. Its value is set before the hypothesis test starts. The  *p*-value is calculated from the data.
