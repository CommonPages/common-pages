name: Additional Information and Full Hypothesis Test Examples - Introduction

The next example is a poem written by a statistics student named Nicole Hart. The solution to the problem follows the poem. Notice that the hypothesis test is for a single population proportion. This means that the null and alternate hypotheses use the parameter  *p*. The distribution for the test is normal. The estimated proportion  *p*′ is the proportion of fleas killed to the total fleas found on Fido. This is sample information. The problem gives a preconceived  *α* = 0.01, for comparison, and a 95% confidence interval computation. The poem is clever and humorous, so please enjoy it!
