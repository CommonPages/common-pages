The  **hypothesis test** itself has an established process. This can be summarized as follows:


  1. Determine  *H0* and  *Ha*. Remember, they are contradictory.
  2. Determine the random variable.
  3. Determine the distribution for the test.
  4. Draw a graph, calculate the test statistic, and use the test statistic to calculate the  *p*-value. (A  *z*-score and a  *t*-score are examples of test statistics.)
  5. Compare the preconceived  *α* with the  *p*-value, make a decision (reject or do not reject  *H0*), and write a clear conclusion using English sentences.

Notice that in performing the hypothesis test, you use  *α* and not  *β*.  *β* is needed to help determine the sample size of the data that is used in calculating the  *p*-value. Remember that the quantity 1 –  *β* is called the  *Power of the Test*. A high power is desirable. If the power is too low, statisticians typically increase the sample size while keeping  *α* the same.If the power is low, the null hypothesis might not be rejected when it should be.
