The central limit theorem tells us that for a population with any distribution, the distribution of the sums for the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. In other words, if the sample size is large enough, the distribution of the sums can be approximated by a normal distribution even if the original population is not normally distributed. Additionally, if the original population has a mean of  *μX* and a standard deviation of  *σx*, the mean of the sums is  *nμx* and the standard deviation is <math xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:cnxorg="http://cnx.rice.edu/system-info" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"> <mrow>  <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msqrt>   <mi>n</mi>  </msqrt>  <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></math>( *σx*) where  *n* is the sample size.
