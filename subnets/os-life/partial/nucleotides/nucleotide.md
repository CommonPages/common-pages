A  **nucleotide** is one of a class of organic compounds composed of three subunits:

  * one or more phosphate groups
  * a pentose sugar: either deoxyribose or ribose
  * a nitrogen-containing base: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil

Nucleotides can be assembled into nucleic acids ({DNA} or {RNA}) or the energy compound adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}).
