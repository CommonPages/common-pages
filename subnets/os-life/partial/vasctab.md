|  | Arteries | Veins |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| General appearance | Thick walls with small lumens <br />Generally appear rounded | Thin walls with large lumens <br />Generally appear flattened |
| Tunica intima | Endothelium usually appears wavy due to constriction of smooth muscle <br />Internal elastic membrane present in larger vessels | Endothelium appears smooth <br />Internal elastic membrane absent |
| Tunica media | Normally the thickest layer in arteries <br />Smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers predominate (the proportions of these vary with distance from the heart) <br />External elastic membrane present in larger vessels | Normally thinner than the tunica externa <br />Smooth muscle cells and collagenous fibers predominate <br />Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present <br />External elastic membrane absent |
| Tunica externa |  Normally thinner than the tunica media in all but the largest arteries <br />Collagenous and elastic fibers <br />Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present |  Normally the thickest layer in veins <br />Collagenous and smooth fibers predominate <br />Some smooth muscle fibers <br />Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present  |
