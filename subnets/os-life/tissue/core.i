/// Ectoderm (inner layer) is one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. Generally speaking, the ectoderm differentiates to form the nervous system, tooth enamel and the epidermis. It also forms the lining of mouth, anus, nostrils, sweat glands, hair and nails.

/// Cell junctions consist of multiprotein complexes that provide contact between neighboring cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. They also build up the paracellular barrier of epithelia and control the paracellular transport.

/// Tight junctions are multiprotein junctional complexes whose general function is to prevent leakage of transported solutes and water and seals the paracellular pathway.

/// Cells within tissues and organs must be anchored to one another and attached to components of the extracellular matrix. Cells have developed several types of junctional complexes to serve these functions, and in each case, anchoring proteins extend through the plasma membrane to link cytoskeletal proteins in one cell to cytoskeletal proteins in neighboring cells as well as to proteins in the extracellular matrix.

    There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.

    Adherens

  >>>
    Desmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface of the cellâ€™s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the cell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in holding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix, for example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins called integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether they are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein actin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a belt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.

/// Gap junctions are a specialized intercellular connection. They directly connect the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to directly pass through a regulated gate between cells.
