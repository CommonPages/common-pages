  /// The thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system. The thymus provides an inductive environment for development of T cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells.

  /// A lymph node is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system and the adaptive immune system. Lymph nodes are widely present throughout the body and are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. They are important for the proper functioning of the immune system.

  /// The human nose is the most protruding part of the face. It bears the nostrils and is the first organ of the respiratory system. It is also the principal organ in the olfactory system. The main function of the nose is respiration, and the nasal mucosa lining the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it.

    /// The nasal root is the top of the nose that attaches the nose to the forehead.
    # The nasal root is above the bridge and below the glabella, forming an indentation known as the nasion at the frontonasal suture where the frontal bone meets the nasal bones.

  /// The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system. Their function is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange.

  /// The thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, in which a negative pressure is created and draws air into the lungs.
