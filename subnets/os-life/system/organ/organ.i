  /// A lymph node is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system and the adaptive immune system. Lymph nodes are widely present throughout the body and are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. They are important for the proper functioning of the immune system.

  /// Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are abnormal lymph nodeâ€“like structures that form in peripheral tissues at sites of chronic inflammation. TLOs typically contains far fewer lymphocytes, and assumes an immune role only when challenged with antigens that result in inflammation.
