title: Molecular Diagnostic Studies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Numerous gene alterations have been identified that impact therapy selection. Testing of lung cancer specimens for these alterations is important for identification of potentially efficacious targeted therapies, as well as avoidance of therapies unlikely to provide clinical benefit. Some selection approaches for targeted therapy include predictive immunohistochemical analyses, which are distinct from immunohistochemical studies utilized to identify tumor type and lineage.

Major elements of molecular testing that are critical for utilization and interpretation of molecular results include:
- Use of a laboratory that is properly accredited, with a minimum of CLIA accreditation
- Understanding the methodologies that are utilized and the major limitations of those methodologies
- Understanding the spectrum of alterations tested (and those not tested) by a specific assay
- Knowledge of whether a tumor sample is subjected to pathologic review and tumor enrichment (ie, microdissection, macrodissection) prior to testing
- The types of samples accepted by the testing laboratory
