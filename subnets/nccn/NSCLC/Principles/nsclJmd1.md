#### Monitoring During Initial Therapy
- Response assessment after 2 cycles, then every 2–4 cycles with CT of known sites of disease with or without contrast or when clinically indicated.

#### Maintenance Therapy
- Continuation maintenance refers to the use of at least one of the agents given in first line, beyond 4–6 cycles, in the absence of disease progression. Switch maintenance refers to the initiation of a different agent, not included as part of the first-line regimen, in the absence of disease progression, after 4–6 cycles of initial therapy.

#### Monitoring During Subsequent Therapy
- Response assessment with CT of known sites of disease with or without contrast every 6–12 weeks. Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical decision.

 <sup>a</sup>  Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be substituted for either paclitaxel or docetaxel in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions after receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel despite premedication, or for patients where the standard premedications (ie, dexamethasone, H2 blockers, H1 blockers) are contraindicated.

 <sup>b</sup>  Carboplatin-based regimens are often used for patients with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin.

 <sup>c</sup>  Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously documented autoimmune disease and/or current use of immunosuppressive d agents or presence of an oncogene, which would predict lack of benefit.

 <sup>d</sup>  If progression on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, switching to another PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not routinely recommended.

 <sup>e</sup>   Bevacizumab should be given until progression.

 <sup>f</sup>  Any regimen with a high risk of thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding should be used with caution in combination with bevacizumab.

 <sup>g</sup>  Criteria for treatment with bevacizumab: non-squamous NSCLC, and no recent history of hemoptysis. Bevacizumab should not be given as a single agent, unless as maintenance if initially used with chemotherapy.
