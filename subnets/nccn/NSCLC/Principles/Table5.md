title: Table 5. Normal Tissue Dose-Volume Constraints for Conventionally Fractionated RT with Concurrent Chemotherapy

|---|---|
| OAR | Constraints in 30–35 fractions |
| Spinal cord | Max ≤50 Gy |
| Lung | V20 ≤35%–40%†; MLD ≤20 Gy |
| Heart | V50 ≤25%; Mean ≤20 Gy |
| Esophagus | Mean ≤34 Gy; Max ≤105% of prescription dose; V60 ≤17%; contralateral sparing is desirable |
| Brachial plexus | Median dose ≤69 Gy |

Vxx = % of the whole OAR receiving ≥xx Gy.

\* These constraints represent doses that generally should not be exceeded. Because the risk of toxicity increases progressively with dose to normal tissues, a key principle of radiation treatment planning is to keep normal tissue doses "as low as reasonably achievable" while adequately covering the target. The doses to any given organ at risk should typically be lower than these constraints, approaching them only when there is close proximity to the target volume.

† Use V20 <35%, especially for the following: elderly ≥70 years, taxane chemotherapy, and poor PFTs (such as FEV1 or DLCO <50% normal). Use more conservative limits with a diagnosis or radiologic evidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IDP)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (the tolerance of these patients is lower though not well characterized).
