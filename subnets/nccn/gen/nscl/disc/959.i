  >>> INTRODUCTION
    Recent data show that EGFR pathway and its inhibition maintain their role after progression of disease during EGFR TKI therapy in NSCLCs. We conducted a retrospective study with the aim of evaluating efficacy and feasibility of prosecution of EGFR TKI therapy beyond focal progression associated to locoregional radiotherapy.

  >>> METHODS
    We retrospectively analyzed the data of all NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs in our institution from 2004 to 2012. We included in the analysis patients that after a focal disease progression, meant as a single lesion RECIST progression, have been treated with definitive locoregional radiotherapy, associated to continuation of EGFR TKI therapy until further progression.

  >>> RESULTS
    15 out of 147 patients (10%) satisfied inclusion criteria. The median progression free survival, measured from the date of focal progression until further progression of disease or death by any cause, was 10,9 months (range 3-32 months). The corresponding 6 and 12 months PFS rates were 73% and 33%, respectively.

  >>> CONCLUSION
    The longer disease control observed in our patients suggests that continuation of EGFR TKI beyond focal progression associated to a locoregional treatment is an efficacious therapeutic strategy.
