# Embeds

Claimspace Markdown provides a few extensions to regular markdown, to support embedded links. Links are written within curly braces {}. Let's explore a few ways to embed a link to `Examples.*My_Term`:

**Simple link:**

{*My_Term}

**Simple link with custom text:**

{*My_Term custom text}

**Embedded link:**

{embed:*My_Term}

**Embedded link as hero:**

{hero:*My_Term}
