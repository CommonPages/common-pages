name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Archaea** are unicellular, prokaryotic microorganisms that differ from bacteria in their genetics, biochemistry, and ecology.
  * Some archaea are extremophiles, living in environments with extremely high or low temperatures, or extreme salinity.
  * Only archaea are known to produce methane. Methane-producing archaea are called  **methanogens**.
  * Halophilic archaea prefer a concentration of salt close to saturation and perform photosynthesis using bacteriorhodopsin.
  * Some archaea, based on fossil evidence, are among the oldest organisms on earth.
  * Archaea do not live in great numbers in human microbiomes and are not known to cause disease.
