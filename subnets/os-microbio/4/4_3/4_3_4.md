name: Planctomycetes

The  **Planctomycetes** are found in aquatic environments, inhabiting freshwater, saltwater, and brackish water. Planctomycetes are unusual in that they reproduce by budding, meaning that instead of one maternal cell splitting into two equal daughter cells in the process of binary fission, the mother cell forms a bud that detaches from the mother cell and lives as an independent cell. These so-called swarmer cells are motile and not attached to a surface. However, they will soon differentiate into sessile (immobile) cells with an appendage called a  **holdfast** that allows them to attach to surfaces in the water ({'Figure_4_3_planctomyc Figure 4.3.planctomyc}). Only the sessile cells are able to reproduce.

****

| Example Genus | Microscopic Morphology | Unique Characteristics |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  **Bacteroides** | Gram-negative bacillus | Obligate anaerobic bacteria; abundant in the human gastrointestinal tract; usually mutualistic, although some species are opportunistic pathogens |
|  **Cytophaga** | Gram-negative bacillus | Motile by gliding; live in soil or water; decompose cellulose; may cause disease in fish |
|  **Fusobacterium** | Gram-negative bacillus with pointed ends | Anaerobic; form; biofilms; some species cause disease in humans (periodontitis, ulcers) |
|  **Leptospira** | Spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochetes); gram negative-like (better viewed by darkfield microscopy); very thin | Aerobic, abundant in shallow water reservoirs; infect rodents and domestic animals; can be transmitted to humans by infected animalsâ€™ urine; may cause severe disease |
|  **Borrelia** | Gram-negative-like spirochete; very thin; better viewed by darkfield microscopy |  *B. burgdorferi* causes Lyme disease and  *B. recurrens* causes relapsing fever |
|  **Treponema** | Gram-negative-like spirochete; very thin; better viewed by darkfield microscopy | Motile; do not grow in culture;  *T. pallidum* (subspecies  *T. pallidum pallidum*) causes syphilis |
