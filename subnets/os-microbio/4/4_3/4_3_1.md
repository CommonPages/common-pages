name: Nonproteobacteria Gram-Negative Bacteria and Phototrophic Bacteria - Introduction

The majority of the gram-negative bacteria belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, discussed in the previous section. Those that do not are called the  **nonproteobacteria**. In this section, we will describe three classes of gram-negative nonproteobacteria: the spirochetes, the  **CFB group**, and the  **Planctomycetes**. A diverse group of phototrophic bacteria that includes Proteobacteria and nonproteobacteria will be discussed at the end of this section.
