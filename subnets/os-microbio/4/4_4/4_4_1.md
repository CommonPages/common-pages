name: Gram-Positive Bacteria - Introduction

Prokaryotes are identified as gram-positive if they have a multiple layer matrix of peptidoglycan forming the cell wall. Crystal violet, the primary stain of the Gram stain procedure, is readily retained and stabilized within this matrix, causing gram-positive  **prokaryotes** to appear purple under a brightfield microscope after Gram staining. For many years, the retention of Gram stain was one of the main criteria used to classify prokaryotes, even though some prokaryotes did not readily stain with either the primary or secondary stains used in the Gram stain procedure.

Advances in nucleic acid biochemistry have revealed additional characteristics that can be used to classify gram-positive prokaryotes, namely the guanine to cytosine ratios (G+C) in DNA and the composition of 16S rRNA subunits. Microbiologists currently recognize two distinct groups of gram-positive, or weakly staining gram-positive, prokaryotes. The class  **Actinobacteria** comprises the  **high G+C gram-positive bacteria**, which have more than 50% guanine and cytosine nucleotides in their DNA. The class  **Bacilli** comprises  **low G+C gram-positive bacteria**, which have less than 50% of guanine and cytosine nucleotides in their DNA.
