name: The Iceman Treateth

Prehistoric humans had a very limited understanding of the causes of disease, and various cultures developed different beliefs and explanations. While many believed that illness was punishment for angering the gods or was simply the result of fate, archaeological evidence suggests that prehistoric people attempted to treat illnesses and infections. One example of this is  **Ötzi the Iceman**, a 5300-year-old mummy found frozen in the ice of the Ötzal Alps on the Austrian-Italian border in 1991. Because Ötzi was so well preserved by the ice, researchers discovered that he was infected with the eggs of the parasite  *Trichuris trichiura*, which may have caused him to have abdominal pain and anemia. Researchers also found evidence of  *Borrelia burgdorferi*, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Some researchers think Ötzi may have been trying to treat his infections with the woody fruit of the  *Piptoporus betulinus* fungus, which was discovered tied to his belongings. This fungus has both laxative and antibiotic properties. Ötzi was also covered in tattoos that were made by cutting incisions into his skin, filling them with herbs, and then burning the herbs. There is speculation that this may have been another attempt to treat his health ailments.
