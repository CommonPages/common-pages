name: Microbiology as a Field of Study

 **Microbiology** is a broad term that encompasses the study of all different types of microorganisms. But in practice, microbiologists tend to specialize in one of several subfields. For example,  **bacteriology** is the study of bacteria;  **mycology** is the study of fungi;  **protozoology** is the study of protozoa;  **parasitology** is the study of helminths and other parasites; and  **virology** is the study of viruses ({'Figure_1_3_atwork Figure 1.3.atwork}).  **Immunology**, the study of the immune system, is often included in the study of microbiology because hostâ€“pathogen interactions are central to our understanding of infectious disease processes. Microbiologists can also specialize in certain areas of microbiology, such as clinical microbiology, environmental microbiology, applied microbiology, or food microbiology.

In this textbook, we are primarily concerned with clinical applications of microbiology, but since the various subfields of microbiology are highly interrelated, we will often discuss applications that are not strictly clinical.
