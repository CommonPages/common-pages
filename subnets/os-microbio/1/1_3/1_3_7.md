  * Microorganisms are very diverse and are found in all three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.
  *  **Archaea** and  **bacteria** are classified as prokaryotes because they lack a cellular nucleus. Archaea differ from bacteria in evolutionary history, genetics, metabolic pathways, and cell wall and membrane composition.
  * Archaea inhabit nearly every environment on earth, but no archaea have been identified as human pathogens.
  *  **Eukaryotes** studied in microbiology include algae, protozoa, fungi, and helminths.
  *  **Algae** are plant-like organisms that can be either unicellular or multicellular, and derive energy via photosynthesis.
  *  **Protozoa** are unicellular organisms with complex cell structures; most are motile.
  * Microscopic  **fungi** include  **molds** and  **yeasts**.
  *  **Helminths** are multicellular parasitic worms. They are included in the field of microbiology because their eggs and larvae are often microscopic.
  *  **Viruses** are acellular microorganisms that require a host to reproduce.
  * The field of microbiology is extremely broad. Microbiologists typically specialize in one of many subfields, but all health professionals need a solid foundation in clinical microbiology.
