  * Carolus Linnaeus developed a taxonomic system for categorizing organisms into related groups.
  *  **Binomial nomenclature** assigns organisms Latinized scientific names with a genus and species designation.
  * A  **phylogenetic tree** is a way of showing how different organisms are thought to be related to one another from an evolutionary standpoint.
  * The first phylogenetic tree contained kingdoms for plants and animals; Ernst Haeckel proposed adding kingdom for protists.
  * Robert Whittaker’s tree contained five kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Protista, Fungi, and Monera.
  * Carl Woese used small subunit ribosomal RNA to create a phylogenetic tree that groups organisms into three domains based on their genetic similarity.
  * Bergey’s manuals of determinative and systemic bacteriology are the standard references for identifying and classifying bacteria, respectively.
  * Bacteria can be identified through biochemical tests, DNA/RNA analysis, and serological testing methods.
