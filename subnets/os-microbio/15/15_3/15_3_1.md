name: Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens - Introduction

In the previous section, we explained that some pathogens are more virulent than others. This is due to the unique  **virulence factor** **s** produced by individual pathogens, which determine the extent and severity of disease they may cause. A pathogen’s virulence factors are encoded by genes that can be identified using molecular Koch’s postulates. When genes encoding virulence factors are inactivated, virulence in the pathogen is diminished. In this section, we examine various types and specific examples of virulence factors and how they contribute to each step of pathogenesis.
