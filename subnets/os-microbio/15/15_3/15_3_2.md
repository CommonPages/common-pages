name: Virulence Factors for Adhesion

As discussed in the previous section, the first two steps in pathogenesis are exposure and adhesion. Recall that an adhesin is a protein or glycoprotein found on the surface of a pathogen that attaches to receptors on the host cell. Adhesins are found on bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan pathogens. One example of a bacterial adhesin is  **type 1 fimbrial adhesin**, a molecule found on the tips of fimbriae of enterotoxigenic  *E. coli* ( **ETEC**). Recall that fimbriae are hairlike protein bristles on the cell surface. Type 1 fimbrial adhesin allows the fimbriae of ETEC cells to attach to the mannose glycans expressed on intestinal epithelial cells.  lists common adhesins found in some of the pathogens we have discussed or will be seeing later in this chapter.
