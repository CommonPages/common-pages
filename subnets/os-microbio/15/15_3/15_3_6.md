name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Virulence factors** contribute to a pathogenâ€™s ability to cause disease.
  *  **Exoenzymes** and  **toxins** allow pathogens to invade host tissue and cause tissue damage. Exoenzymes are classified according to the macromolecule they target and exotoxins are classified based on their mechanism of action.
  * Bacterial toxins include  **endotoxin** and  **exotoxins**. Endotoxin is the lipid A component of the LPS of the gram-negative cell envelope. Exotoxins are proteins secreted mainly by gram-positive bacteria, but also are secreted by gram-negative bacteria.
  * Bacterial pathogens may evade the host immune response by producing  **capsules** to avoid phagocytosis, surviving the intracellular environment of phagocytes, degrading antibodies, or through  **antigenic variation**.
  * Viral pathogens use adhesins for initiating infections and antigenic variation to avoid immune defenses.
  * Influenza viruses use both  **antigenic drift** and  **antigenic shift** to avoid being recognized by the immune system.
