name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * In an  **infection**, a microorganism enters a host and begins to multiply. Some infections cause  **disease**, which is any deviation from the normal function or structure of the host.
  *  **Signs** of a disease are objective and are measured.  **Symptoms** of a disease are subjective and are reported by the patient.
  * Diseases can either be  **noninfectious** (due to genetics and environment) or  **infectious** (due to pathogens). Some infectious diseases are  **communicable** (transmissible between individuals) or  **contagious** (easily transmissible between individuals); others are  **noncommunicable**, but may be contracted via contact with environmental reservoirs or animals ( **zoonoses**)
  *  **Nosocomial diseases** are contracted in hospital settings, whereas  **iatrogenic disease** are the direct result of a medical procedure
  * An  **acute disease** is short in duration, whereas a  **chronic disease** lasts for months or years.  **Latent diseases** last for years, but are distinguished from chronic diseases by the lack of active replication during extended dormant periods.
  * The periods of disease include the  **incubation period**, the  **prodromal period**, the  **period of illness**, the  **period of decline**, and the  **period of convalescence**. These periods are marked by changes in the number of infectious agents and the severity of signs and symptoms.
