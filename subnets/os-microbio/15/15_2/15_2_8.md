name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Koch’s postulates** are used to determine whether a particular microorganism is a pathogen.  **Molecular Koch’s postulates** are used to determine what genes contribute to a pathogen’s ability to cause disease.
  *  **Virulence**, the degree to which a pathogen can cause disease, can be quantified by calculating either the  **ID50** or  **LD50** of a pathogen on a given population.
  *  **Primary pathogens** are capable of causing pathological changes associated with disease in a healthy individual, whereas  **opportunistic pathogens** can only cause disease when the individual is compromised by a break in protective barriers or immunosuppression.
  * Infections and disease can be caused by pathogens in the environment or microbes in an individual’s  **resident microbiota**.
  * Infections can be classified as  **local**,  **focal**, or  **systemic** depending on the extent to which the pathogen spreads in the body.
  * A  **secondary infection** can sometimes occur after the host’s defenses or normal microbiota are compromised by a  **primary infection** or antibiotic treatment.
  * Pathogens enter the body through  **portals of entry** and leave through  **portals of exit**. The stages of pathogenesis include  **exposure**,  **adhesion**,  **invasion**,  **infection**, and  **transmission**.
