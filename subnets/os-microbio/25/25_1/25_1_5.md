name: Infections of the Lymphatic System

Like the circulatory system, the lymphatic system does not have a normal microbiota, and the large numbers of immune cells typically eliminate transient microbes before they can establish an infection. Only microbes with an array of virulence factors are able to overcome these defenses and establish infection in the lymphatic system. However, when a localized infection begins to spread, the lymphatic system is often the first place the invading microbes can be detected.

Infections in the lymphatic system also trigger an inflammatory response. Inflammation of lymphatic vessels, called  **lymphangitis**, can produce visible red streaks under the skin. Inflammation in the lymph nodes can cause them to swell. A swollen lymph node is referred to as a  **bubo**, and the condition is referred to as  **lymphadenitis**.
