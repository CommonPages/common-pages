name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The  **circulatory system** moves blood throughout the body and has no normal microbiota.
  * The  **lymphatic system** moves fluids from the interstitial spaces of tissues toward the circulatory system and filters the lymph. It also has no normal microbiota.
  * The circulatory and lymphatic systems are home to many components of the host immune defenses.
  * Infections of the circulatory system may occur after a break in the skin barrier or they may enter the bloodstream at the site of a localized infection. Pathogens or toxins in the bloodstream can spread rapidly throughout the body and can provoke systemic and sometimes fatal inflammatory responses such as  **SIRS**,  **sepsis**, and  **endocarditis**.
  * Infections of the lymphatic system can cause  **lymphangitis** and  **lymphadenitis**.
