name: Anatomy of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems - Introduction

The circulatory and lymphatic systems are networks of vessels and a pump that transport blood and lymph, respectively, throughout the body.

In this section, we will examine some of the key anatomical features of the circulatory and lymphatic systems, as well as general signs and symptoms of infection.
