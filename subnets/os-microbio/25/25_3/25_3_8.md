name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Human herpesviruses such  **Epstein-Barr virus** (HHV-4) and  **cytomegalovirus** (HHV-5) are widely distributed. The former is associated with infectious mononucleosis and Burkitt lymphoma, and the latter can cause serious congenital infections as well as serious disease in immunocompromised adults.
  * Arboviral diseases such as y **ellow fever, dengue fever,** and  **chikungunya fever** are characterized by high fevers and vascular damage that can often be fatal.  **Ebola virus disease** is a highly contagious and often fatal infection spread through contact with bodily fluids.
  * Although there is a vaccine available for yellow fever, treatments for patients with yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya fever, and Ebola virus disease are limited to supportive therapies.
  * Patients infected with  **human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)** progress through three stages of disease, culminating in  **AIDS**.  **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)** uses various combinations of drugs to suppress viral loads, extending the period of latency and reducing the likelihood of transmission.
  * Vector control and animal reservoir control remain the best defenses against most viruses that cause diseases of the circulatory system.
