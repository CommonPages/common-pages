name: Chronic Inflammation

When acute inflammation is unable to clear an infectious pathogen,  **chronic inflammation** may occur. This often results in an ongoing (and sometimes futile) lower-level battle between the host organism and the pathogen. The wounded area may heal at a superficial level, but pathogens may still be present in deeper tissues, stimulating ongoing inflammation. Additionally, chronic inflammation may be involved in the progression of degenerative neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, heart disease, and metastatic cancer.

Chronic inflammation may lead to the formation of  **granuloma** **s**, pockets of infected tissue walled off and surrounded by WBCs. Macrophages and other phagocytes wage an unsuccessful battle to eliminate the pathogens and dead cellular materials within a granuloma. One example of a disease that produces chronic inflammation is  **tuberculosis**, which results in the formation of granulomas in lung tissues. A tubercular granuloma is called a tubercle ({'Figure_17_6_Granuloma Figure 17.6.Granuloma}). Tuberculosis will be covered in more detail in <link:>.

Chronic inflammation is not just associated with bacterial infections. Chronic inflammation can be an important cause of tissue damage from viral infections. The extensive scarring observed with hepatitis C infections and liver cirrhosis is the result of chronic inflammation.
