name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Inflammation** results from the collective response of chemical mediators and cellular defenses to an injury or infection.
  *  **Acute inflammation** is short lived and localized to the site of injury or infection.  **Chronic inflammation** occurs when the inflammatory response is unsuccessful, and may result in the formation of  **granulomas** (e.g., with tuberculosis) and scarring (e.g., with hepatitis C viral infections and liver cirrhosis).
  * The five cardinal signs of inflammation are  **erythema**,  **edema**, heat, pain, and altered function. These largely result from innate responses that draw increased blood flow to the injured or infected tissue.
  *  **Fever** is a system-wide sign of inflammation that raises the body temperature and stimulates the immune response.
  * Both inflammation and fever can be harmful if the inflammatory response is too severe.
