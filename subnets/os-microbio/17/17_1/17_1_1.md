name: Physical Defenses - Introduction

Nonspecific innate immunity can be characterized as a multifaceted system of defenses that targets invading pathogens in a nonspecific manner. In this chapter, we have divided the numerous defenses that make up this system into three categories: physical defenses, chemical defenses, and cellular defenses. However, it is important to keep in mind that these defenses do not function independently, and the categories often overlap.  provides an overview of the nonspecific defenses discussed in this chapter.


| Overview of Nonspecific Innate Immune Defenses |
|:-:|
| Physical defenses | Physical barriers |
| Mechanical defenses |
| Microbiome |
| Chemical defenses | Chemicals and enzymes in body fluids |
| Antimicrobial peptides |
| Plasma protein mediators |
| Cytokines |
| Inflammation-eliciting mediators |
| Cellular defenses | Granulocytes |
| Agranulocytes |
    

Physical defenses provide the bodyâ€™s most basic form of nonspecific defense. They include physical barriers to microbes, such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as mechanical defenses that physically remove microbes and debris from areas of the body where they might cause harm or infection. In addition, the microbiome provides a measure of physical protection against disease, as microbes of the normal microbiota compete with pathogens for nutrients and cellular binding sites necessary to cause infection.
