name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Nonspecific innate immunity** provides a first line of defense against infection by nonspecifically blocking entry of microbes and targeting them for destruction or removal from the body.
  * The physical defenses of innate immunity include physical barriers, mechanical actions that remove microbes and debris, and the microbiome, which competes with and inhibits the growth of pathogens.
  * The skin, mucous membranes, and endothelia throughout the body serve as physical barriers that prevent microbes from reaching potential sites of infection. Tight cell junctions in these tissues prevent microbes from passing through.
  * Microbes trapped in dead skin cells or  **mucus** are removed from the body by mechanical actions such as shedding of skin cells, mucociliary sweeping, coughing,  **peristalsis**, and flushing of bodily fluids (e.g., urination, tears)
  * The resident microbiota provide a physical defense by occupying available cellular binding sites and competing with pathogens for available nutrients.
