name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Phagocytes are cells that recognize pathogens and destroy them through phagocytosis.
  * Recognition often takes place by the use of phagocyte receptors that bind molecules commonly found on pathogens, known as  **pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)**.
  * The receptors that bind PAMPs are called  **pattern recognition receptors**, or  **PRRs**.  **Toll-like receptors** ( **TLRs**) are one type of PRR found on phagocytes.
  *  **Extravasation** of white blood cells from the bloodstream into infected tissue occurs through the process of  **transendothelial migration**.
  * Phagocytes degrade pathogens through  **phagocytosis**, which involves engulfing the pathogen, killing and digesting it within a  **phagolysosome**, and then excreting undigested matter.
