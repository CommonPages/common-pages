name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Numerous  **chemical mediators** produced endogenously and exogenously exhibit nonspecific antimicrobial functions.
  * Many chemical mediators are found in body fluids such as sebum, saliva, mucus, gastric and intestinal fluids, urine, tears, cerumen, and vaginal secretions.
  *  **Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)** found on the skin and in other areas of the body are largely produced in response to the presence of pathogens. These include dermcidin, cathelicidin, defensins, histatins, and bacteriocins.
  *  **Plasma** contains various proteins that serve as chemical mediators, including  **acute-phase proteins**,  **complement proteins**, and  **cytokines**.
  * The  **complement system** involves numerous precursor proteins that circulate in plasma. These proteins become activated in a cascading sequence in the presence of microbes, resulting in the  **opsonization** of pathogens, chemoattraction of leukocytes, induction of inflammation, and cytolysis through the formation of a  **membrane attack complex (MAC)**.
  *  **Cytokines** are proteins that facilitate various nonspecific responses by innate immune cells, including production of other chemical mediators, cell proliferation, cell death, and differentiation.
  * Cytokines play a key role in the inflammatory response, triggering production of inflammation-eliciting mediators such as acute-phase proteins,  **histamine**, leukotrienes,  **prostaglandins**, and  **bradykinin**.
