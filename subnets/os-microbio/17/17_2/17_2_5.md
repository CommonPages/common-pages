name: Inflammation-Eliciting Mediators

Many of the chemical mediators discussed in this section contribute in some way to inflammation and fever, which are nonspecific immune responses discussed in more detail in <link:>. Cytokines stimulate the production of  **acute-phase proteins** such as  **C-reactive protein** and  **mannose-binding lectin** in the liver. These acute-phase proteins act as  **opsonins**, activating complement cascades through the lectin pathway.

Some cytokines also bind  **mast cells** and  **basophils**, inducing them to release  **histamine**, a proinflammatory compound. Histamine receptors are found on a variety of cells and mediate proinflammatory events, such as bronchoconstriction (tightening of the airways) and smooth muscle contraction.

In addition to histamine, mast cells may release other chemical mediators, such as  **leukotrienes**. Leukotrienes are lipid-based proinflammatory mediators that are produced from the metabolism of arachidonic acid in the cell membrane of leukocytes and tissue cells. Compared with the proinflammatory effects of histamine, those of leukotrienes are more potent and longer lasting. Together, these chemical mediators can induce coughing, vomiting, and diarrhea, which serve to expel pathogens from the body.

Certain cytokines also stimulate the production of  **prostaglandins**, chemical mediators that promote the inflammatory effects of kinins and histamines. Prostaglandins can also help to set the body temperature higher, leading to  **fever**, which promotes the activities of white blood cells and slightly inhibits the growth of pathogenic microbes (see <link:>).

Another inflammatory mediator,  **bradykinin**, contributes to  **edema**, which occurs when fluids and leukocytes leak out of the bloodstream and into tissues. It binds to receptors on cells in the capillary walls, causing the capillaries to dilate and become more permeable to fluids.

 provides a summary of the chemical defenses discussed in this section.

| Defense | Examples | Function |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Chemicals and enzymes in body fluids | Sebum from sebaceous glands | Provides oil barrier protecting hair follicle pores from pathogens |
| Oleic acid from sebum and skin microbiota | Lowers pH to inhibit pathogens |
| Lysozyme in secretions | Kills bacteria by attacking cell wall |
| Acid in stomach, urine, and vagina | Inhibits or kills bacteria |
| Digestive enzymes and bile | Kill bacteria |
| Lactoferrin and transferrin | Bind and sequester iron, inhibiting bacterial growth |
| Surfactant in lungs | Kills bacteria |
| Antimicrobial peptides | Defensins, bacteriocins, dermicidin, cathelicidin, histatins, | Kill bacteria by attacking membranes or interfering with cell functions |
| Plasma protein mediators | Acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, ferritin, fibrinogen, transferrin, and mannose-binding lectin) | Inhibit the growth of bacteria and assist in the trapping and killing of bacteria |
| Complements C3b and C4b | Opsonization of pathogens to aid phagocytosis |
| Complement C5a | Chemoattractant for phagocytes |
| Complements C3a and C5a | Proinflammatory anaphylatoxins |
| Cytokines | Interleukins | Stimulate and modulate most functions of immune system |
| Chemokines | Recruit white blood cells to infected area |
| Interferons | Alert cells to viral infection, induce apoptosis of virus-infected cells, induce antiviral defenses in infected and nearby uninfected cells, stimulate immune cells to attack virus-infected cells |
| Inflammation-eliciting mediators | Histamine | Promotes vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, smooth muscle contraction, increased secretion and mucus production |
| Leukotrienes | Promote inflammation; stronger and longer lasting than histamine |
| Prostaglandins | Promote inflammation and fever |
| Bradykinin | Increases vasodilation and vascular permeability, leading to edema |
