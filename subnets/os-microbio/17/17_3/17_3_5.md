name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The  **formed elements** of the blood include red blood cells ( **erythrocytes**), white blood cells ( **leukocytes**), and  **platelets (thrombocytes**). Of these, leukocytes are primarily involved in the immune response.
  * All formed elements originate in the bone marrow as stem cells (HSCs) that differentiate through  **hematopoiesis**.
  *  **Granulocytes** are leukocytes characterized by a lobed nucleus and granules in the cytoplasm. These include  **neutrophils (PMNs)**,  **eosinophils**, and  **basophils**.
  * Neutrophils are the leukocytes found in the largest numbers in the bloodstream and they primarily fight bacterial infections.
  * Eosinophils target parasitic infections. Eosinophils and basophils are involved in allergic reactions. Both release histamine and other proinflammatory compounds from their granules upon stimulation.
  *  **Mast cells** function similarly to basophils but can be found in tissues outside the bloodstream.
  *  **Natural killer** ( **NK**) cells are lymphocytes that recognize and kill abnormal or infected cells by releasing proteins that trigger apoptosis.
  *  **Monocytes** are large, mononuclear leukocytes that circulate in the bloodstream. They may leave the bloodstream and take up residence in body tissues, where they differentiate and become tissue-specific  **macrophages** and  **dendritic cells**.
