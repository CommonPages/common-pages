name: Hematopoiesis

All of the formed elements of blood are derived from pluripotent  **hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)** in the bone marrow. As the HSCs make copies of themselves in the bone marrow, individual cells receive different cues from the body that control how they develop and mature. As a result, the HSCs differentiate into different types of blood cells that, once mature, circulate in peripheral blood. This process of differentiation, called  **hematopoiesis**, is shown in more detail in {'Figure_17_5_Hematopo Figure 17.5.Hematopo}.

In terms of sheer numbers, the vast majority of HSCs become erythrocytes. Much smaller numbers become leukocytes and platelets. Leukocytes can be further subdivided into  **granulocytes**, which are characterized by numerous granules visible in the cytoplasm, and  **agranulocytes**, which lack granules. {'Figure_17_5_FormElem Figure 17.5.FormElem} provides an overview of the various types of formed elements, including their relative numbers, primary function, and lifespans.
