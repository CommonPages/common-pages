  * Viral cultivation requires the presence of some form of host cell (whole organism, embryo, or cell culture).
  * Viruses can be isolated from samples by filtration.
  * Viral filtrate is a rich source of released virions.
  * Bacteriophages are detected by presence of clear  **plaques** on bacterial lawn.
  * Animal and plant viruses are detected by  **cytopathic effects**, molecular techniques (PCR, RT-PCR), enzyme immunoassays, and serological assays (hemagglutination assay, hemagglutination inhibition assay).
