name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Many viruses target specific hosts or tissues. Some may have more than one host.
  * Many viruses follow several stages to infect host cells. These stages include  **attachment, penetration, uncoating, biosynthesis, maturation,** and  **release**.
  * Bacteriophages have a  **lytic** or  **lysogenic**  **cycle**. The lytic cycle leads to the death of the host, whereas the lysogenic cycle leads to integration of phage into the host genome.
  * Bacteriophages inject DNA into the host cell, whereas animal viruses enter by endocytosis or membrane fusion.
  * Animal viruses can undergo  **latency**, similar to lysogeny for a bacteriophage.
  * The majority of plant viruses are positive-strand ssRNA and can undergo latency, chronic, or lytic infection, as observed for animal viruses.
  * The growth curve of bacteriophage populations is a  **one-step multiplication curve** and not a sigmoidal curve, as compared to the bacterial growth curve.
  * Bacteriophages transfer genetic information between hosts using either  **generalized** or  **specialized transduction**.
