name: Viral Growth Curve

Unlike the growth curve for a bacterial population, the growth curve for a virus population over its life cycle does not follow a sigmoidal curve. During the initial stage, an inoculum of virus causes infection. In the  **eclipse phase**, viruses bind and penetrate the cells with no virions detected in the medium. The chief difference that next appears in the viral growth curve compared to a bacterial growth curve occurs when virions are released from the lysed host cell at the same time. Such an occurrence is called a  **burst**, and the number of virions per bacterium released is described as the  **burst size**. In a  **one-step multiplication curve for bacteriophage**, the host cells lyse, releasing many viral particles to the medium, which leads to a very steep rise in  **viral titer** (the number of virions per unit volume). If no viable host cells remain, the viral particles begin to degrade during the decline of the culture (see {'Figure_6_2_growth Figure 6.2.growth}).
