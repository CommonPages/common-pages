name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Viruses are generally ultramicroscopic, typically from 20 nm to 900 nm in length. Some large viruses have been found.
  *  **Virions** are acellular and consist of a nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, but not both, surrounded by a protein  **capsid**. There may also be a phospholipid membrane surrounding the capsid.
  * Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites.
  * Viruses are known to infect various types of cells found in plants, animals, fungi, protists, bacteria, and archaea. Viruses typically have limited  **host ranges** and infect specific cell types.
  * Viruses may have  **helical**,  **polyhedral,** or  **complex** shapes.
  * Classification of viruses is based on morphology, type of nucleic acid, host range, cell specificity, and enzymes carried within the virion.
  * Like other diseases, viral diseases are classified using ICD codes.
