name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Other acellular agents such as  **viroids**,  **virusoids**, and  **prions** also cause diseases. Viroids consist of small, naked ssRNAs that cause diseases in plants. Virusoids are ssRNAs that require other helper viruses to establish an infection. Prions are proteinaceous infectious particles that cause  **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies**.
  * Prions are extremely resistant to chemicals, heat, and radiation.
  * There are no treatments for prion infection.
