name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Although cells were first observed in the 1660s by Robert Hooke,  **cell theory** was not well accepted for another 200 years. The work of scientists such as Schleiden, Schwann, Remak, and Virchow contributed to its acceptance.
  *  **Endosymbiotic theory** states that mitochondria and chloroplasts, organelles found in many types of organisms, have their origins in bacteria. Significant structural and genetic information support this theory.
  * The  **miasma theory of disease** was widely accepted until the 19th century, when it was replaced by the  **germ theory of disease** thanks to the work of Semmelweis, Snow, Pasteur, Lister, and Koch, and others.
