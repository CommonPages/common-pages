name: Foundations of Modern Cell Theory - Introduction

While some scientists were arguing over the theory of spontaneous generation, other scientists were making discoveries leading to a better understanding of what we now call the  **cell theory**. Modern cell theory has two basic tenets:

  * All cells only come from other cells (the principle of biogenesis).
  * Cells are the fundamental units of organisms.

Today, these tenets are fundamental to our understanding of life on earth. However, modern cell theory grew out of the collective work of many scientists.
