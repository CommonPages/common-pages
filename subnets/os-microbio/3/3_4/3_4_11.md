name: Cell Wall

In addition to a plasma membrane, some eukaryotic cells have a  **cell wall**. Cells of fungi, algae, plants, and even some protists have cell walls. Depending upon the type of eukaryotic cell, cell walls can be made of a wide range of materials, including  **cellulose** (fungi and plants); biogenic silica, calcium carbonate, agar, and carrageenan (protists and algae); or  **chitin** (fungi). In general, all cell walls provide structural stability for the cell and protection from environmental stresses such as desiccation, changes in osmotic pressure, and traumatic injury.
