name: The Nucleoid

All cellular life has a DNA genome organized into one or more chromosomes. Prokaryotic chromosomes are typically circular, haploid (unpaired), and not bound by a complex nuclear membrane. Prokaryotic DNA and DNA-associated proteins are concentrated within the  **nucleoid** region of the cell ({'Figure_3_3_Nucleoid Figure 3.3.Nucleoid}). In general, prokaryotic DNA interacts with  **nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs)** that assist in the organization and packaging of the chromosome. In bacteria, NAPs function similar to histones, which are the DNA-organizing proteins found in eukaryotic cells. In archaea, the nucleoid is organized by either NAPs or histone-like DNA organizing proteins.
