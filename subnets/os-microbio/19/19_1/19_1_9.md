name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * An  **allergy** is an adaptive immune response, sometimes life-threatening, to an  **allergen**.
  *  **Type I hypersensitivity** requires sensitization of mast cells with IgE, involving an initial IgE antibody response and IgE attachment to mast cells. On second exposure to an allergen, cross-linking of IgE molecules on mast cells triggers degranulation and release of preformed and newly formed chemical mediators of inflammation. Type I hypersensitivity may be localized and relatively minor (hives and hay fever) or system-wide and dangerous (systemic  **anaphylaxis**).
  *  **Type II hypersensitivities** result from antibodies binding to antigens on cells and initiating cytotoxic responses. Examples include  **hemolytic transfusion reaction** and  **hemolytic disease of the newborn**.
  *  **Type III hypersensitivities** result from formation and accumulation of  **immune complexes** in tissues, stimulating damaging inflammatory responses.
  *  **Type IV hypersensitivities** are not mediated by antibodies, but by helper T-cell activation of macrophages, eosinophils, and cytotoxic T cells.
