    Immunodeficiencies are inherited (primary) or acquired (secondary) disorders in which elements of host immune defenses are either absent or functionally defective. In developed countries, most immunodeficiencies are inherited, and they are usually first seen in the clinic as recurrent or overwhelming infections in infants. However, on a global scale,  **malnutrition** is the most common cause of  **immunodeficiency** and would be categorized as an acquired immunodeficiency. Acquired immunodeficiencies are more likely to develop later in life, and the pathogenic mechanisms of many remain obscure.
