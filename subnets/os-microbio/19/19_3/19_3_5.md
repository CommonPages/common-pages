name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Grafts and transplants can be classified as  **autografts**,  **isografts, allografts**, or  **xenografts** based on the genetic differences between the donor’s and recipient’s tissues.
  * Genetic differences, especially among the MHC (HLA) genes, will dictate the likelihood that  **rejection** of the transplanted tissue will occur.
  * Transplant recipients usually require immunosuppressive therapy to avoid rejection, even with good genetic matching. This can create additional problems when immune responses are needed to fight off infectious agents and prevent cancer.
  *  **Graft-versus-host disease** can occur in bone marrow transplants, as the mature T cells in the transplant itself recognize the recipient’s tissues as foreign.
  * Transplantation methods and technology have improved greatly in recent decades and may move into new areas with the use of stem cell technology to avoid the need for genetic matching of MHC molecules.
