name: Graft-versus-Host Disease

A form of rejection called  **graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)** primarily occurs in recipients of  **bone marrow transplant**s and peripheral blood stem cells. GHVD presents a unique situation because the transplanted tissue is capable of producing immune cells; APCs in the donated bone marrow may recognize the host cells as non-self, leading to activation of the donor cytotoxic T cells. Once activated, the donorâ€™s T cells attack the recipient cells, causing  **acute GVHD**.

Acute GVHD typically develops within weeks after a bone marrow transplant, causing tissue damage affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and eyes. In addition, acute GVHD may also lead to a  **cytokine storm**, an unregulated secretion of cytokines that may be fatal. In addition to acute GVHD, there is also the risk for  **chronic GVHD** developing months after the bone marrow transplant. The mechanisms responsible for chronic GVHD are not well understood.

To minimize the risk of GVHD, it is critically important to match the HLAs of the host and donor as closely as possible in bone marrow transplants. In addition, the donated bone marrow is processed before grafting to remove as many donor APCs and T cells as possible, leaving mostly  **hematopoietic stem cell**s.
