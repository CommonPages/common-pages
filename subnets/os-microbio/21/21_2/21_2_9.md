name: Bacterial Keratitis

Keratitis can have many causes, but  **bacterial keratitis** is most frequently caused by  **Staphylococcus epidermidis** and/or  **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**. Contact lens users are particularly at risk for such an infection because  *S. epidermidis* and  *P. aeruginosa* both adhere well to the surface of the lenses. Risk of infection can be greatly reduced by proper care of contact lenses and avoiding wearing lenses overnight. Because the infection can quickly lead to blindness, prompt and aggressive treatment with antibiotics is important. The causative agent may be identified using bacterial cultures, Gram stain, and diagnostic biochemical, antigenic, or nucleic acid profile tests of the isolated pathogen.
