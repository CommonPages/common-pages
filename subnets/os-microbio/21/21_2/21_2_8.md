name: Trachoma

 **Trachoma**, or  **granular conjunctivitis**, is a common cause of preventable blindness that is rare in the United States but widespread in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. The condition is caused by the same species that causes neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis in infants,  **Chlamydia trachomatis**.  *C. trachomatis* can be transmitted easily through fomites such as contaminated towels, bed linens, and clothing and also by direct contact with infected individuals.  *C. trachomatis* can also be spread by flies that transfer infected mucous containing  *C. trachomatis* from one human to another.

Infection by  *C. trachomatis* causes chronic  **conjunctivitis**, which leads to the formation of necrotic follicles and scarring in the upper eyelid. The scars turn the eyelashes inward (a condition known as  **trichiasis**) and mechanical abrasion of the cornea leads to blindness ({'Figure_21_2_trachiasis Figure 21.2.trachiasis}). Antibiotics such as  **azithromycin** are effective in treating trachoma, and outcomes are good when the disease is treated promptly. In areas where this disease is common, large public health efforts are focused on reducing transmission by teaching people how to avoid the risks of the infection.
