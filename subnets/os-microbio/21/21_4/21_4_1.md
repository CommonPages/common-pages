name: Mycoses of the Skin - Introduction

Many fungal infections of the skin involve fungi that are found in the normal skin microbiota. Some of these fungi can cause infection when they gain entry through a wound; others mainly cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Other fungal pathogens primarily cause infection in unusually moist environments that promote fungal growth; for example, sweaty shoes, communal showers, and locker rooms provide excellent breeding grounds that promote the growth and transmission of fungal pathogens.

Fungal infections, also called  **mycoses**, can be divided into classes based on their invasiveness. Mycoses that cause superficial infections of the epidermis, hair, and nails, are called  **cutaneous mycoses**. Mycoses that penetrate the epidermis and the dermis to infect deeper tissues are called  **subcutaneous mycoses**. Mycoses that spread throughout the body are called  **systemic mycoses**.
