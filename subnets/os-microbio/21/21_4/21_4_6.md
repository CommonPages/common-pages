name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Mycoses** can be  **cutaneous**,  **subcutaneous**, or  **systemic.**
  * Common cutaneous mycoses include  **tineas** caused by  **dermatophytes** of the genera  *Trichophyton*,  *Epidermophyton*, and  *Microsporum.*  **Tinea corporis** is called  **ringworm**. Tineas on other parts of the body have names associated with the affected body part.
  *  **Aspergillosis** is a fungal disease caused by molds of the genus  *Aspergillus*. Primary cutaneous aspergillosis enters through a break in the skin, such as the site of an injury or a surgical wound; it is a common hospital-acquired infection. In secondary cutaneous aspergillosis, the fungus enters via the respiratory system and disseminates systemically, manifesting in lesions on the skin.
  * The most common subcutaneous mycosis is  **sporotrichosis** (rose gardenerâ€™s disease), caused by  *Sporothrix schenkii.*
  * Yeasts of the genus  *Candida* can cause opportunistic infections of the skin called  **candidiasis**, producing  **intertrigo**, localized rashes, or yellowing of the nails.
