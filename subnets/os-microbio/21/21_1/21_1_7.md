name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Human skin consists of two main layers, the  **epidermis** and  **dermis**, which are situated on top of the  **hypodermis**, a layer of connective tissue.
  * The skin is an effective physical barrier against microbial invasion.
  * The skin’s relatively dry environment and normal microbiota discourage colonization by transient microbes.
  * The skin’s normal microbiota varies from one region of the body to another.
  * The  **conjunctiva** of the eye is a frequent site for microbial infection, but deeper eye infections are less common; multiple types of conjunctivitis exist.
