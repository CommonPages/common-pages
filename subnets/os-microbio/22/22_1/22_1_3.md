name: Anatomy of the Lower Respiratory System

The lower respiratory system begins below the epiglottis in the larynx or voice box ({'Figure_22_1_LowerResp Figure 22.1.LowerResp}). The  **trachea**, or windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube extending from the larynx that provides an unobstructed path for air to reach the lungs. The trachea bifurcates into the left and right  **bronchi** as it reaches the lungs. These paths branch repeatedly to form smaller and more extensive networks of tubes, the  **bronchiole**s. The terminal bronchioles formed in this tree-like network end in cul-de-sacs called the  **alveoli**. These structures are surrounded by capillary networks and are the site of gas exchange in the respiratory system. Human lungs contain on the order of 400,000,000 alveoli. The outer surface of the lungs is protected with a double-layered pleural membrane. This structure protects the lungs and provides lubrication to permit the lungs to move easily during respiration.
