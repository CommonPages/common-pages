name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The respiratory tract is divided into upper and lower regions at the  **epiglottis**.
  * Air enters the upper respiratory tract through the  **nasal cavity** and mouth, which both lead to the  **pharynx**. The lower respiratory tract extends from the  **larynx** into the  **trachea** before branching into the  **bronchi**, which divide further to form the  **bronchioles**, which terminate in  **alveoli**, where gas exchange occurs.
  * The upper respiratory tract is colonized by an extensive and diverse normal microbiota, many of which are potential pathogens. Few microbial inhabitants have been found in the lower respiratory tract, and these may be transients.
  * Members of the normal microbiota may cause opportunistic infections, using a variety of strategies to overcome the innate nonspecific defenses (including the mucociliary escalator) and adaptive specific defenses of the respiratory system.
  * Effective vaccines are available for many common respiratory pathogens, both bacterial and viral.
  * Most respiratory infections result in inflammation of the infected tissues; these conditions are given names ending in  *-itis*, such as  **rhinitis**,  **sinusitis**,  **otitis**,  **pharyngitis**, and  **bronchitis**.
