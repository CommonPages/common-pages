#  *Pneumocystis* Pneumonia

A type of pneumonia called  **Pneumocystis pneumonia** (PCP) is caused by  **Pneumocystis jirovecii**. Once thought to be a protozoan, this organism was formerly named  *P. carinii* but it has been reclassified as a fungus and renamed based on biochemical and genetic analyses.  *Pneumocystis* is a leading cause of pneumonia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and can be seen in other compromised patients and premature infants. Respiratory infection leads to fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Diagnosis of these infections can be difficult. The organism is typically identified by microscopic examination of tissue and fluid samples from the lungs ({'Figure_22_4_jirovecii Figure 22.4.jirovecii}). A PCR-based test is available to detect  *P. jirovecii* in asymptomatic patients with AIDS. The best treatment for these infections is the combination drug  **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** (TMP/SMZ). These sulfa drugs often have adverse effects, but the benefits outweigh these risks. Left untreated, PCP infections are often fatal.
