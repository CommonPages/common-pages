name: Using Physical Methods to Control Microorganisms - Introduction

For thousands of years, humans have used various physical methods of microbial control for  **food preservation**. Common control methods include the application of high temperatures, radiation, filtration, and desiccation (drying), among others. Many of these methods nonspecifically kill cells by disrupting membranes, changing membrane permeability, or damaging proteins and nucleic acids by denaturation, degradation, or chemical modification. Various physical methods used for microbial control are described in this section.
