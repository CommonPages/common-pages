name: Sonication

The use of high-frequency ultrasound waves to disrupt cell structures is called  **sonication**. Application of ultrasound waves causes rapid changes in pressure within the intracellular liquid; this leads to  **cavitation**, the formation of bubbles inside the cell, which can disrupt cell structures and eventually cause the cell to lyse or collapse. Sonication is useful in the laboratory for efficiently lysing cells to release their contents for further research; outside the laboratory, sonication is used for cleaning surgical instruments, lenses, and a variety of other objects such as coins, tools, and musical instruments.
