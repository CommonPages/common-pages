name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Chemical disinfectants are grouped by the types of microbes and infectious agents they are effective against.  **High-level germicides** kill vegetative cells, fungi, viruses, and endospores, and can ultimately lead to sterilization.  **Intermediate-level germicides** cannot kill all viruses and are less effective against endospores.  **Low-level germicides** kill vegetative cells and some enveloped viruses, but are ineffective against endospores.
  * The effectiveness of a disinfectant is influenced by several factors, including length of exposure, concentration of disinfectant, temperature, and pH.
  * Historically, the effectiveness of a chemical disinfectant was compared with that of phenol at killing  *Staphylococcus aureus* and  *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi, and a  **phenol coefficient** was calculated.
  * The  **disk-diffusion method** is used to test the effectiveness of a chemical disinfectant against a particular microbe.
  * The  **use-dilution test** determines the effectiveness of a disinfectant on a surface.  **In-use tests** can determine whether disinfectant solutions are being used correctly in clinical settings.
