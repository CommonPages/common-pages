name: Disk-Diffusion Method

The  **disk-diffusion method** involves applying different chemicals to separate, sterile filter paper disks ({'Figure_13_4_Diskdiff Figure 13.4.Diskdiff}). The disks are then placed on an agar plate that has been inoculated with the targeted bacterium and the chemicals diffuse out of the disks into the agar where the bacteria have been inoculated. As the “lawn” of bacteria grows,  **zones of inhibition** of microbial growth are observed as clear areas around the disks. Although there are other factors that contribute to the sizes of zones of inhibition (e.g., whether the agent is water soluble and able to diffuse in the agar), larger zones typically correlate to increased inhibition effectiveness of the chemical agent. The diameter across each zone is measured in millimeters.
