name: Phenol Coefficient

The effectiveness of a disinfectant or antiseptic can be determined in a number of ways. Historically, a chemical agent’s effectiveness was often compared with that of phenol, the first chemical agent used by Joseph  **Lister**. In 1903, British chemists Samuel  **Rideal** (1863–1929) and J. T. Ainslie  **Walker** (1868–1930) established a protocol to compare the effectiveness of a variety of chemicals with that of phenol, using as their test organisms  **Staphylococcus aureus** (a gram-positive bacterium) and  **Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi** (a gram-negative bacterium). They exposed the test bacteria to the antimicrobial chemical solutions diluted in water for 7.5 minutes. They then calculated a phenol coefficient for each chemical for each of the two bacteria tested. A  **phenol coefficient** of 1.0 means that the chemical agent has about the same level of effectiveness as phenol. A chemical agent with a phenol coefficient of less than 1.0 is less effective than phenol. An example is  **formalin**, with phenol coefficients of 0.3 ( *S. aureus*) and 0.7 ( *S. enterica* serovar Typhi). A chemical agent with a phenol coefficient greater than 1.0 is more effective than phenol, such as chloramine, with phenol coefficients of 133 and 100, respectively. Although the phenol coefficient was once a useful measure of effectiveness, it is no longer commonly used because the conditions and organisms used were arbitrarily chosen.
