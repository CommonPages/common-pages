name: Bisbiguanides

Bisbiguanides were first synthesized in the 20th century and are cationic (positively charged) molecules known for their antiseptic properties ({'Figure_13_3_bisbi Figure 13.3.bisbi}). One important  **bisbiguanide** antiseptic is  **chlorhexidine**. It has broad-spectrum activity against yeasts, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of  **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**, which may develop resistance on repeated exposure. Chlorhexidine disrupts cell membranes and is bacteriostatic at lower concentrations or bactericidal at higher concentrations, in which it actually causes the cellsâ€™ cytoplasmic contents to congeal. It also has activity against enveloped viruses. However, chlorhexidine is poorly effective against  **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** and nonenveloped viruses, and it is not sporicidal. Chlorhexidine is typically used in the clinical setting as a surgical scrub and for other handwashing needs for medical personnel, as well as for topical antisepsis for patients before surgery or needle injection. It is more persistent than iodophors, providing long-lasting antimicrobial activity. Chlorhexidine solutions may also be used as oral rinses after oral procedures or to treat gingivitis. Another bisbiguanide,  **alexidine**, is gaining popularity as a surgical scrub and an oral rinse because it acts faster than chlorhexidine.
