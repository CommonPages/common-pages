name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Dental caries**,  **tartar**, and  **gingivitis** are caused by overgrowth of oral bacteria, usually  *Streptococcus* and  *Actinomyces* species, as a result of insufficient dental hygiene.
  * Gingivitis can worsen, allowing  *Porphyromonas*,  *Streptococcus*, and  *Actinomyces* species to spread and cause  **periodontitis**. When  *Prevotella intermedia*,  *Fusobacterium* species, and  *Treponema vicentii* are involved, it can lead to  **acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis**.
  * The herpes simplex virus type 1 can cause lesions of the mouth and throat called  **herpetic gingivostomatitis.**
  * Other infections of the mouth include  **oral thrush**, a fungal infection caused by overgrowth of  *Candida* yeast, and  **mumps**, a viral infection of the salivary glands caused by the mumps virus, a paramyxovirus.
