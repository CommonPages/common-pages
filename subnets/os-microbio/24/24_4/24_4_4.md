name: Gastroenteritis Caused by Astroviruses

 **Astroviruses** are single-stranded RNA viruses (family  **Astroviridae**) that can cause severe gastroenteritis, especially in infants and children. Signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, headache, and malaise. The viruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route (contaminated food or water). For diagnosis, stool samples are analyzed. Testing may involve enzyme immunoassays and immune electron microscopy. Treatment involves supportive rehydration and electrolyte replacement if needed.
