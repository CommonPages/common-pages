# Foodborne Illness Due to  *Yersinia*

The genus  **Yersinia** is best known for  *Yersinia pestis*, a gram-negative rod that causes the plague. However,  *Y. enterocolitica* and  *Y. pseudotuberculosis* can cause  **gastroenteritis**. The infection is generally transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with ingestion of food or water that has been contaminated by feces. Intoxication can also result because of the activity of its  **endotoxin** and  **exotoxins** ( **enterotoxin** and  **cytotoxin necrotizing factor**). The illness is normally relatively mild and self-limiting. However, severe diarrhea and dysentery can develop in infants. In adults, the infection can spread and cause complications such as reactive arthritis, thyroid disorders, endocarditis, glomerulonephritis, eye inflammation, and/or erythema nodosum. Bacteremia may develop in rare cases.

Diagnosis is generally made by detecting the bacteria in stool samples. Samples may also be obtained from other tissues or body fluids. Treatment is usually supportive, including rehydration, without antibiotics. If bacteremia or other systemic disease is present, then antibiotics such as  **fluoroquinolones**,  **aminoglycosides**,  **doxycycline**, and  **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** may be used. Recovery can take up to two weeks.
