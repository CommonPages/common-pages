name: Cyclosporiasis

The intestinal disease  **cyclosporiasis** is caused by the protozoan  **Cyclospora cayetanensis**. It is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions and therefore uncommon in the United States, although there have been outbreaks associated with contaminated produce imported from regions where the protozoan is more common.

This  **protist** is transmitted through contaminated food and water and reaches the lining of the small intestine, where it causes infection. Signs and symptoms begin within seven to ten days after ingestion. Based on limited data, it appears to be seasonal in ways that differ regionally and that are poorly understood.

Some individuals do not develop signs or symptoms. Those who do may exhibit explosive and watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, cramps, loss of appetite, fatigue, and bloating. These symptoms may last for months without treatment. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the recommended treatment.

Microscopic examination is used for diagnosis. A stool  **O&P** examination may be helpful. The oocysts have a distinctive blue halo when viewed using ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy ({'Figure_24_5_Cyclospor Figure 24.5.Cyclospor}).
