name: Helminthic Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract - Introduction

Helminths are widespread intestinal parasites. These parasites can be divided into three common groups: round-bodied worms also described as  **nematodes**, flat-bodied worms that are segmented (also described as  **cestodes**), and flat-bodied worms that are non-segmented (also described as  **trematodes**). The nematodes include  **roundworms**,  **pinworms**,  **hookworms**, and  **whipworms**. Cestodes include beef, pork, and fish  **tapeworms**. Trematodes are collectively called  **flukes** and more uniquely identified with the body site where the adult flukes are located. Although infection can have serious consequences, many of these parasites are so well adapted to the human host that there is little obvious disease.
