name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The digestive tract, consisting of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, has a normal microbiota that is important for health.
  * The constant movement of materials through the gastrointestinal canal, the protective layer of mucus, the normal microbiota, and the harsh chemical environment in the stomach and small intestine help to prevent colonization by pathogens.
  * Infections or microbial toxins in the oral cavity can cause  **tooth decay**,  **periodontal disease**, and various types of  **ulcers**.
  * Infections and intoxications of the gastrointestinal tract can cause general symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Localized inflammation of the GI tract can result in  **gastritis**,  **enteritis**,  **gastroenteritis**,  **hepatitis**, or  **colitis**, and damage to epithelial cells of the colon can lead to  **dysentery**.
  *  **Foodborne illness** refers to infections or intoxications that originate with pathogens or toxins ingested in contaminated food or water.
