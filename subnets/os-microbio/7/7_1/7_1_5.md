Carbon chains form the skeletons of most organic molecules. Functional groups combine with the chain to form biomolecules. Because these biomolecules are typically large, we call them  **macromolecule**s. Many biologically relevant macromolecules are formed by linking together a great number of identical, or very similar, smaller organic molecules. The smaller molecules act as building blocks and are called  **monomer** **s**, and the macromolecules that result from their linkage are called  **polymer** **s**. Cells and cell structures include four main groups of carbon-containing macromolecules:  **polysaccharides**,  **proteins**,  **lipids**, and  **nucleic acids**. The first three groups of molecules will be studied throughout this chapter. The biochemistry of nucleic acids will be discussed in <link:>.

Of the many possible ways that monomers may be combined to yield polymers, one common approach encountered in the formation of biological macromolecules is  **dehydration synthesis**. In this chemical reaction, monomer molecules bind end to end in a process that results in the formation of water molecules as a byproduct:
