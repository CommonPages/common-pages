name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The most abundant elements in cells are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
  * Life is carbon based. Each carbon atom can bind to another one producing a  **carbon skeleton** that can be straight, branched, or ring shaped.
  * The same numbers and types of atoms may bond together in different ways to yield different molecules called  **isomers**. Isomers may differ in the bonding sequence of their atoms ( **structural isomers**) or in the spatial arrangement of atoms whose bonding sequences are the same ( **stereoisomers**), and their physical and chemical properties may vary slightly or drastically.
  *  **Functional groups** confer specific chemical properties to molecules bearing them. Common functional groups in biomolecules are hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl.
  *  **Macromolecules** are  **polymers** assembled from individual units, the  **monomers**, which bind together like building blocks. Many biologically significant macromolecules are formed by  **dehydration synthesis**, a process in which monomers bind together by combining their functional groups and generating water molecules as byproducts.
