name: Monosaccharides: The Sweet Ones

In biochemistry, carbohydrates are often called  **saccharide** **s**, from the Greek  *sakcharon*, meaning sugar, although not all the saccharides are sweet. The simplest carbohydrates are called  **monosaccharide** **s**, or simple sugars. They are the building blocks (monomers) for the synthesis of polymers or complex carbohydrates, as will be discussed further in this section. Monosaccharides are classified based on the number of carbons in the molecule. General categories are identified using a prefix that indicates the number of carbons and the suffix – *ose*, which indicates a saccharide; for example, triose (three carbons), tetrose (four carbons), pentose (five carbons), and hexose (six carbons) ({'Figure_7_2_monosacch Figure 7.2.monosacch}). The hexose D-glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in nature. Other very common and abundant hexose monosaccharides are  **galactose**, used to make the disaccharide milk sugar  **lactose**, and the fruit sugar  **fructose**.

Monosaccharides of four or more carbon atoms are typically more stable when they adopt cyclic, or ring, structures. These ring structures result from a chemical reaction between functional groups on opposite ends of the sugar’s flexible carbon chain, namely the carbonyl group and a relatively distant hydroxyl group. Glucose, for example, forms a six-membered ring ({'Figure_7_2_cyclicMon Figure 7.2.cyclicMon}).
