name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Carbohydrates**, the most abundant biomolecules on earth, are widely used by organisms for structural and energy-storage purposes.
  * Carbohydrates include individual sugar molecules ( **monosaccharides**) as well as two or more molecules chemically linked by  **glycosidic bonds**.  **Monosaccharides** are classified based on the number of carbons the molecule as trioses (3 C), tetroses (4 C), pentoses (5 C), and hexoses (6 C). They are the building blocks for the synthesis of polymers or complex carbohydrates.
  *  **Disaccharides** such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are molecules composed of two monosaccharides linked together by a glycosidic bond.
  *  **Polysaccharides**, or  **glycans**, are polymers composed of hundreds of monosaccharide monomers linked together by glycosidic bonds. The energy-storage polymers  **starch** and  **glycogen** are examples of polysaccharides and are all composed of branched chains of glucose molecules.
  * The polysaccharide  **cellulose** is a common structural component of the cell walls of organisms. Other structural polysaccharides, such as N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) and N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM), incorporate modified glucose molecules and are used in the construction of peptidoglycan or chitin.
