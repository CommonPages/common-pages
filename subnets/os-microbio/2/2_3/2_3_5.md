name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Numerous types of microscopes use various technologies to generate micrographs. Most are useful for a particular type of specimen or application.
  *  **Light microscopy** uses lenses to focus light on a specimen to produce an image. Commonly used light microscopes include  **brightfield**,  **darkfield**,  **phase-contrast**,  **differential interference contrast**,  **fluorescence**,  **confocal**, and  **two-photon** microscopes.
  *  **Electron microscopy** focuses electrons on the specimen using magnets, producing much greater magnification than light microscopy. The  **transmission electron microscope (TEM)** and  **scanning electron microscope (SEM)** are two common forms.
  *  **Scanning probe microscopy** produces images of even greater magnification by measuring feedback from sharp probes that interact with the specimen. Probe microscopes include the  **scanning tunneling microscope (STM)** and the  **atomic force microscope (AFM)**.
