name: Acid-Fast Stains

Acid-fast staining is another commonly used, differential staining technique that can be an important diagnostic tool. An  **acid-fast stain** is able to differentiate two types of gram-positive cells: those that have waxy mycolic acids in their cell walls, and those that do not. Two different methods for acid-fast staining are the  **Ziehl-Neelsen technique** and the  **Kinyoun technique**. Both use  **carbolfuchsin** as the primary stain. The waxy, acid-fast cells retain the carbolfuchsin even after a decolorizing agent (an acid-alcohol solution) is applied. A secondary counterstain, methylene blue, is then applied, which renders nonâ€“acid-fast cells blue.

The fundamental difference between the two carbolfuchsin-based methods is whether heat is used during the primary staining process. The Ziehl-Neelsen method uses heat to infuse the carbolfuchsin into the acid-fast cells, whereas the Kinyoun method does not use heat. Both techniques are important diagnostic tools because a number of specific diseases are caused by  **acid-fast bacteria** (AFB). If AFB are present in a tissue sample, their red or pink color can be seen clearly against the blue background of the surrounding tissue cells ().
