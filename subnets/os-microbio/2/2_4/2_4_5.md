name: Capsule Staining

Certain bacteria and yeasts have a protective outer structure called a capsule. Since the presence of a capsule is directly related to a microbeâ€™s virulence (its ability to cause disease), the ability to determine whether cells in a sample have  **capsules** is an important diagnostic tool. Capsules do not absorb most basic dyes; therefore, a negative staining technique (staining around the cells) is typically used for  **capsule staining**. The dye stains the background but does not penetrate the capsules, which appear like halos around the borders of the cell. The specimen does not need to be heat-fixed prior to negative staining.

One common negative staining technique for identifying encapsulated yeast and bacteria is to add a few drops of  **India ink** or  **nigrosin** to a specimen. Other capsular stains can also be used to negatively stain encapsulated cells ({'Figure_2_4_CapsuStain Figure 2.4.CapsuStain}). Alternatively, positive and negative staining techniques can be combined to visualize capsules: The positive stain colors the body of the cell, and the negative stain colors the background but not the capsule, leaving halo around each cell.
