name: Preparation and Staining for Other Microscopes

Samples for fluorescence and confocal microscopy are prepared similarly to samples for light microscopy, except that the dyes are fluorochromes. Stains are often diluted in liquid before applying to the slide. Some dyes attach to an antibody to stain specific proteins on specific types of cells ( **immunofluorescence**); others may attach to DNA molecules in a process called  **fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)**, causing cells to be stained based on whether they have a specific DNA sequence.

Sample preparation for two-photon microscopy is similar to fluorescence microscopy, except for the use of infrared dyes. Specimens for STM need to be on a very clean and atomically smooth surface. They are often mica coated with Au(111). Toluene vapor is a common fixative.
