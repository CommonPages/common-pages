name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Samples must be properly prepared for microscopy. This may involve  **staining**,  **fixation**, and/or cutting  **thin sections**.
  * A variety of staining techniques can be used with light microscopy, including  **Gram staining, acid-fast staining**,  **capsule staining**,  **endospore staining,** and  **flagella staining**.
  * Samples for TEM require very thin sections, whereas samples for SEM require sputter-coating.
  * Preparation for fluorescence microscopy is similar to that for light microscopy, except that fluorochromes are used.
