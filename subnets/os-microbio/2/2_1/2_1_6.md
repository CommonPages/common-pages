name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Light waves interacting with materials may be  **reflected**,  **absorbed**, or  **transmitted**, depending on the properties of the material.
  * Light waves can interact with each other ( **interference**) or be distorted by interactions with small objects or openings ( **diffraction**).
  *  **Refraction** occurs when light waves change speed and direction as they pass from one medium to another. Differences in the  **refraction indices** of two materials determine the magnitude of directional changes when light passes from one to the other.
  * A  **lens** is a medium with a curved surface that refracts and focuses light to produce an image.
  * Visible light is part of the  **electromagnetic spectrum**; light waves of different frequencies and wavelengths are distinguished as colors by the human eye.
  * A prism can separate the colors of white light ( **dispersion**) because different frequencies of light have different refractive indices for a given material.
  *  **Fluorescent dyes** and  **phosphorescent** materials can effectively transform nonvisible electromagnetic radiation into visible light.
  * The power of a microscope can be described in terms of its  **magnification** and  **resolution**.
  * Resolution can be increased by shortening wavelength, increasing the  **numerical aperture** of the lens, or using stains that enhance contrast.
