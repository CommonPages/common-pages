/ The Properties of Light
story 2_1
  >
    Visible light consists of electromagnetic waves that behave like other waves. Hence, many of the  **properties of light** that are relevant to microscopy can be understood in terms of lightâ€™s behavior as a wave. An important property of light waves is the  **wavelength**, or the distance between one peak of a wave and the next peak. The height of each peak (or depth of each trough) is called the  **amplitude**. In contrast, the  **frequency** of the wave is the rate of vibration of the wave, or the number of wavelengths within a specified time period ({'Figure_2_1_Freqwave Figure 2.1.Freqwave}).
