  *  **Viral meningitis** is more common and generally less severe than bacterial menigitis. It can result from secondary sequelae of many viruses or be caused by infections of arboviruses.
  * Various types of  **arboviral encephalitis** are concentrated in particular geographic locations throughout the world. These mosquito-borne viral infections of the nervous system are typically mild, but they can be life-threatening in some cases.
  *  **Zika virus** is an emerging arboviral infection with generally mild symptoms in most individuals, but infections of pregnant women can cause the birth defect microcephaly.
  *  **Polio** is typically a mild intestinal infection but can be damaging or fatal if it progresses to a neurological disease.
  *  **Rabies** is nearly always fatal when untreated and remains a significant problem worldwide.
  *  **Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies** such as  **Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease** and  **kuru** are caused by prions. These diseases are untreatable and ultimately fatal. Similar prion diseases are found in animals.
