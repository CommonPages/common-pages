name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Neuromycoses** are uncommon in immunocompetent people, but immunocompromised individuals with fungal infections have high mortality rates. Treatment of neuromycoses require prolonged therapy with antifungal drugs at low doses to avoid side effects and overcome the effect of the blood-brain barrier.
  * Some protist infections of the nervous systems are fatal if not treated, including  **primary amoebic meningitis**,  **granulomatous amoebic encephalitis**,  **human African trypanosomiasis**, and  **neurotoxoplasmosis**.
  * The various forms of ameobic encephalitis caused by the different amoebic infections are typically fatal even with treatment, but they are rare.
  *  **African trypanosomiasis** is a serious but treatable disease endemic to two distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa caused by the insect-borne hemoflagellate  *Trypanosoma brucei*.
  *  **Neurocysticercosis** is treated using antihelminthic drugs or surgery to remove the large cysts from the CNS.
