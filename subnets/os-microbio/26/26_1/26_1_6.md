name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The nervous system consists of two subsystems: the  **central nervous system** and  **peripheral nervous system**.
  * The skull and three  **meninges** (the  **dura mater**,  **arachnoid mater**, and  **pia mater**) protect the brain.
  * Tissues of the PNS and CNS are formed of cells called  **glial cells** and  **neurons**.
  * Since the  **blood-brain barrier** excludes most microbes, there is no normal microbiota in the CNS.
  * Some pathogens have specific virulence factors that allow them to breach the blood-brain barrier. Inflammation of the brain or  **meninges** caused by infection is called  **encephalitis** or  **meningitis**, respectively. These conditions can lead to blindness, deafness, coma, and death.
