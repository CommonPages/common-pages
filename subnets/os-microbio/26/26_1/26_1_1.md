name: Anatomy of the Nervous System - Introduction

The human nervous system can be divided into two interacting subsystems: the  **peripheral nervous system (PNS)** and the  **central nervous system (CNS)**. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system is an extensive network of nerves connecting the CNS to the muscles and sensory structures. The relationship of these systems is illustrated in {'Figure_26_1_NervSys Figure 26.1.NervSys}.
