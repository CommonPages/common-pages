name: The Cells of the Nervous System

Tissues of the PNS and CNS are formed of cells called  **glial cells** (neuroglial cells) and  **neurons** (nerve cells). Glial cells assist in the organization of neurons, provide a scaffold for some aspects of neuronal function, and aid in recovery from neural injury.

Neurons are specialized cells found throughout the nervous system that transmit signals through the nervous system using electrochemical processes. The basic structure of a neuron is shown in {'Figure_26_1_Neruron Figure 26.1.Neruron}. The cell body (or  **soma**) is the metabolic center of the neuron and contains the nucleus and most of the cellâ€™s organelles. The many finely branched extensions from the soma are called  **dendrites**. The soma also produces an elongated extension, called the  **axon**, which is responsible for the transmission of electrochemical signals through elaborate ion transport processes. Axons of some types of neurons can extend up to one meter in length in the human body. To facilitate electrochemical signal transmission, some neurons have a  **myelin sheath** surrounding the axon. Myelin, formed from the cell membranes of glial cells like the  **Schwann cells** in the PNS and  **oligodendrocytes** in the CNS, surrounds and insulates the axon, significantly increasing the speed of electrochemical signal transmission along the axon. The end of an axon forms numerous branches that end in bulbs called synaptic terminals. Neurons form junctions with other cells, such as another neuron, with which they exchange signals. The junctions, which are actually gaps between neurons, are referred to as  **synapses**. At each synapse, there is a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron (or other cell). The synaptic terminals of the axon of the presynaptic terminal form the synapse with the dendrites, soma, or sometimes the axon of the postsynaptic neuron, or a part of another type of cell such as a muscle cell. The synaptic terminals contain vesicles filled with chemicals called  **neurotransmitters**. When the electrochemical signal moving down the axon reaches the synapse, the vesicles fuse with the membrane, and neurotransmitters are released, which diffuse across the synapse and bind to receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, potentially initiating a response in that cell. That response in the postsynaptic cell might include further propagation of an electrochemical signal to transmit information or contraction of a muscle fiber.
