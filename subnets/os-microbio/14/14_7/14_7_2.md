name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Current research into the development of antimicrobial drugs involves the use of high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry technologies.
  * New technologies are being developed to discover novel antibiotics from soil microorganisms that cannot be cultured by standard laboratory methods.
  * Additional strategies include searching for antibiotics from sources other than soil, identifying new antibacterial targets, using combinatorial chemistry to develop novel drugs, developing drugs that inhibit resistance mechanisms, and developing drugs that target virulence factors and hold infections in check.
