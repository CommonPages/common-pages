name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The  **Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion** test helps determine the susceptibility of a microorganism to various antimicrobial drugs. However, the  **zones of inhibition** measured must be correlated to known standards to determine susceptibility and resistance, and do not provide information on bactericidal versus bacteriostatic activity, or allow for direct comparison of drug potencies.
  * Antibiograms are useful for monitoring local trends in antimicrobial resistance/susceptibility and for directing appropriate selection of empiric antibacterial therapy.
  * There are several laboratory methods available for determining the  **minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)** of an antimicrobial drug against a specific microbe. The  **minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)** can also be determined, typically as a follow-up experiment to MIC determination using the tube dilution method.
