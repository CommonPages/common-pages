name: Use of Antimicrobials in Ancient Societies

Although the discovery of antimicrobials and their subsequent widespread use is commonly associated with modern medicine, there is evidence that humans have been exposed to antimicrobial compounds for millennia. Chemical analyses of the skeletal remains of people from Nubia (now found in present-day Sudan) dating from between 350 and 550 AD have shown residue of the antimicrobial agent  **tetracycline** in high enough quantities to suggest the purposeful fermentation of tetracycline-producing  *Streptomyces* during the beer-making process. The resulting  **beer**, which was thick and gruel-like, was used to treat a variety of ailments in both adults and children, including gum disease and wounds. The antimicrobial properties of certain plants may also have been recognized by various cultures around the world, including Indian and Chinese  **herbalists** ({'Figure_14_1_Woodcut Figure 14.1.Woodcut}) who have long used plants for a wide variety of medical purposes. Healers of many cultures understood the antimicrobial properties of fungi and their use of moldy bread or other mold-containing products to treat wounds has been well documented for centuries. Today, while about 80% of the worldâ€™s population still relies on plant-derived medicines, scientists are now discovering the active compounds conferring the medicinal benefits contained in many of these traditionally used plants.
