name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Antimicrobial drugs can be  **bacteriostatic** or  **bactericidal**, and these characteristics are important considerations when selecting the most appropriate drug.
  * The use of  **narrow-spectrum** antimicrobial drugs is preferred in many cases to avoid  **superinfection** and the development of antimicrobial resistance.
  *  **Broad-spectrum** antimicrobial use is warranted for serious systemic infections when there is no time to determine the causative agent, when narrow-spectrum antimicrobials fail, or for the treatment or prevention of infections with multiple types of microbes.
  * The  **dosage** and  **route of administration** are important considerations when selecting an antimicrobial to treat and infection. Other considerations include the patientâ€™s age, mass, ability to take oral medications, liver and kidney function, and possible interactions with other drugs the patient may be taking.
