name: Drug Interactions

For the optimum treatment of some infections, two antibacterial drugs may be administered together to provide a  **synergistic interaction** that is better than the efficacy of either drug alone. A classic example of synergistic combinations is  **trimethoprim** and  **sulfamethoxazole** ( **Bactrim**). Individually, these two drugs provide only  **bacteriostatic** inhibition of bacterial growth, but combined, the drugs are  **bactericidal**.

Whereas synergistic drug interactions provide a benefit to the patient, antagonistic interactions produce harmful effects. Antagonism can occur between two antimicrobials or between antimicrobials and nonantimicrobials being used to treat other conditions. The effects vary depending on the drugs involved, but antagonistic interactions may cause loss of drug activity, decreased therapeutic levels due to increased metabolism and elimination, or increased potential for  **toxicity** due to decreased metabolism and elimination. As an example, some antibacterials are absorbed most effectively from the acidic environment of the stomach. If a patient takes antacids, however, this increases the pH of the stomach and negatively impacts the absorption of these antimicrobials, decreasing their effectiveness in treating an infection. Studies have also shown an association between use of some antimicrobials and failure of oral contraceptives.
