name: Multidrug-Resistant Microbes and Cross Resistance

From a clinical perspective, our greatest concerns are  **multidrug-resistant microbes (MDRs)** and cross resistance. MDRs are colloquially known as “ **superbugs**” and carry one or more resistance mechanism(s), making them resistant to multiple antimicrobials. In  **cross-resistance**, a single resistance mechanism confers resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs. For example, having an  **efflux pump** that can export multiple antimicrobial drugs is a common way for microbes to be resistant to multiple drugs by using a single resistance mechanism. In recent years, several clinically important superbugs have emerged, and the CDC reports that superbugs are responsible for more than 2 million infections in the US annually, resulting in at least 23,000 fatalities. Several of the superbugs discussed in the following sections have been dubbed the  **ESKAPE pathogens**. This acronym refers to the names of the pathogens ( **Enterococcus faecium**,  **Staphylococcus aureus**,  **Klebsiella pneumoniae**,  **Acinetobacter baumannii**,  **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** and  **Enterobacter spp.**) but it is also fitting in that these pathogens are able to “escape” many conventional forms of antimicrobial therapy. As such, infections by ESKAPE pathogens can be difficult to treat and they cause a large number of nosocomial infections.
