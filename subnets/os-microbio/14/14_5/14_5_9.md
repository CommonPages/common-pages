name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Antimicrobial resistance** is on the rise and is the result of selection of drug-resistant strains in clinical environments, the overuse and misuse of antibacterials, the use of subtherapeutic doses of antibacterial drugs, and poor patient compliance with antibacterial drug therapies.
  * Drug resistance genes are often carried on plasmids or in transposons that can undergo vertical transfer easily and between microbes through horizontal gene transfer.
  * Common modes of antimicrobial drug resistance include drug modification or inactivation, prevention of cellular uptake or efflux, target modification, target overproduction or enzymatic bypass, and target mimicry.
  * Problematic microbial strains showing extensive antimicrobial resistance are emerging; many of these strains can reside as members of the normal microbiota in individuals but also can cause opportunistic infection. The transmission of many of these highly resistant microbial strains often occurs in clinical settings, but can also be community-acquired.
