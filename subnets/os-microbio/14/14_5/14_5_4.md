name: Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

# Methicillin-Resistant  *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA)

Methicillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, was designed to resist inactivation by β-lactamases. Unfortunately, soon after the introduction of methicillin to clinical practice, methicillin-resistant strains of  *S. aureus* appeared and started to spread. The mechanism of resistance, acquisition of a new low-affinity PBP, provided  *S. aureus* with resistance to all available β-lactams. Strains of  **methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)** are widespread opportunistic pathogens and a particular concern for skin and other wound infections, but may also cause  **pneumonia** and  **septicemia**. Although originally a problem in health-care settings (hospital-acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA]), MRSA infections are now also acquired through contact with contaminated members of the general public, called community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). Approximately one-third of the population carries  *S. aureus* as a member of their normal nasal microbiota without illness, and about 6% of these strains are methicillin resistant.
