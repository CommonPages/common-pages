# Multidrug-Resistant  *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

The emergence of  **multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB)** and  **extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis** ( **XDR-TB**) is also of significant global concern. MDR-TB strains are resistant to both  **rifampin** and  **isoniazid**, the drug combination typically prescribed for treatment of tuberculosis. XDR-TB strains are additionally resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three other drugs ( **amikacin**,  **kanamycin**, or  **capreomycin**) used as a second line of treatment, leaving these patients very few treatment options. Both types of pathogens are particularly problematic in immunocompromised persons, including those suffering from  **HIV** infection. The development of resistance in these strains often results from the incorrect use of antimicrobials for  **tuberculosis** treatment, selecting for resistance.
