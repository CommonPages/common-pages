name: Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase–Producing Gram-Negative Pathogens

Gram-negative pathogens that produce  **extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)** show resistance well beyond just penicillins. The spectrum of  **β-lactams** inactivated by ESBLs provides for resistance to all  **penicillins**,  **cephalosporins**,  **monobactams**, and the β-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, but not the  **carbapenems**. An even greater concern is that the genes encoding for ESBLs are usually found on mobile plasmids that also contain genes for resistance to other drug classes (e.g.,  **fluoroquinolones**,  **aminoglycosides**,  **tetracyclines**), and may be readily spread to other bacteria by  **horizontal gene transfer**. These multidrug-resistant bacteria are members of the intestinal microbiota of some individuals, but they are also important causes of opportunistic infections in hospitalized patients, from whom they can be spread to other people.
