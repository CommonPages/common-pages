name: Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria

The occurrence of  **carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)** and carbapenem resistance among other gram-negative bacteria (e.g.,  *P. aeruginosa*,  **Acinetobacter baumannii**,  **Stenotrophomonas maltophila**) is a growing health-care concern. These pathogens develop resistance to carbapenems through a variety of mechanisms, including production of  **carbapenemases** (broad-spectrum  **β-lactamases** that inactivate all β-lactams, including carbapenems), active efflux of carbapenems out of the cell, and/or prevention of carbapenem entry through  **porin channels**. Similar to concerns with ESBLs, carbapenem-resistant, gram-negative pathogens are usually resistant to multiple classes of antibacterials, and some have even developed  **pan-resistance** (resistance to all available antibacterials). Infections with carbapenem-resistant, gram-negative pathogens commonly occur in health-care settings through interaction with contaminated individuals or medical devices, or as a result of surgery.
