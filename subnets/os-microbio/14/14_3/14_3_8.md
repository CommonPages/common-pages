name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Antibacterial compounds exhibit  **selective toxicity**, largely due to differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structure.
  * Cell wall synthesis inhibitors, including the  **Î²-lactams**, the  **glycopeptides**, and  **bacitracin**, interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis, making bacterial cells more prone to osmotic lysis.
  * There are a variety of broad-spectrum, bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors that selectively target the prokaryotic 70S ribosome, including those that bind to the 30S subunit ( **aminoglycosides** and  **tetracyclines**) and others that bind to the 50S subunit ( **macrolides**,  **lincosamides**,  **chloramphenicol**, and  **oxazolidinones**).
  *  **Polymyxins** are lipophilic polypeptide antibiotics that target the lipopolysaccharide component of gram-negative bacteria and ultimately disrupt the integrity of the outer and inner membranes of these bacteria.
  * The nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors rifamycins and  **fluoroquinolones** target bacterial RNA transcription and DNA replication, respectively.
  * Some antibacterial drugs are  **antimetabolites**, acting as competitive inhibitors for bacterial metabolic enzymes.  **Sulfonamides** and  **trimethoprim** are antimetabolites that interfere with bacterial folic acid synthesis.  **Isoniazid** is an antimetabolite that interferes with mycolic acid synthesis in mycobacteria.
