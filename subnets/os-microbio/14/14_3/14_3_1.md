name: Mechanisms of Antibacterial Drugs - Introduction

An important quality for an antimicrobial drug is  **selective toxicity**, meaning that it selectively kills or inhibits the growth of microbial targets while causing minimal or no harm to the host. Most  **antimicrobial drugs** currently in clinical use are antibacterial because the prokaryotic cell provides a greater variety of unique targets for selective toxicity, in comparison to fungi, parasites, and viruses. Each class of antibacterial drugs has a unique  **mode of action** (the way in which a drug affects microbes at the cellular level), and these are summarized in {'Figure_14_2_Modes Figure 14.2.Modes} and .
