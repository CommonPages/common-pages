name: Inhibitors of Cell Wall Biosynthesis

Several different classes of antibacterials block steps in the biosynthesis of  **peptidoglycan**, making cells more susceptible to osmotic lysis (). Therefore, antibacterials that target cell wall biosynthesis are bactericidal in their action. Because human cells do not make peptidoglycan, this mode of action is an excellent example of selective toxicity.

Penicillin, the first antibiotic discovered, is one of several antibacterials within a class called  **β-lactams**. This group of compounds includes the  **penicillins**,  **cephalosporins**,  **monobactams**, and  **carbapenems**, and is characterized by the presence of a  **β-lactam ring** found within the central structure of the drug molecule ({'Figure_14_2_BetaLactam Figure 14.2.BetaLactam}). The β-lactam antibacterials block the crosslinking of peptide chains during the biosynthesis of new peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall. They are able to block this process because the β-lactam structure is similar to the structure of the peptidoglycan subunit component that is recognized by the crosslinking  **transpeptidase** enzyme, also known as a  **penicillin-binding protein (PBP)**. Although the β-lactam ring must remain unchanged for these drugs to retain their antibacterial activity, strategic chemical changes to the R groups have allowed for development of a wide variety of semisynthetic β-lactam drugs with increased  **potency**, expanded  **spectrum of activity**, and longer half-lives for better dosing, among other characteristics.

Penicillin G and penicillin V are natural antibiotics from fungi and are primarily active against gram-positive bacterial pathogens, and a few gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as  **Pasteurella multocida**. {'Figure_14_2_BetaLactam Figure 14.2.BetaLactam} summarizes the semisynthetic development of some of the penicillins. Adding an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) to penicillin G created the  **aminopenicillins** (i.e.,  **ampicillin** and  **amoxicillin**) that have increased spectrum of activity against more gram-negative pathogens. Furthermore, the addition of a hydroxyl group (-OH) to amoxicillin increased acid stability, which allows for improved oral absorption. Methicillin is a semisynthetic penicillin that was developed to address the spread of enzymes ( **penicillinases**) that were inactivating the other penicillins. Changing the  **R group** of penicillin G to the more bulky dimethoxyphenyl group provided protection of the  **β-lactam ring** from enzymatic destruction by penicillinases, giving us the first penicillinase-resistant penicillin.

Similar to the penicillins,  **cephalosporins** contain a β-lactam ring ({'Figure_14_2_BetaLactam Figure 14.2.BetaLactam}) and block the  **transpeptidase** activity of penicillin-binding proteins. However, the β-lactam ring of cephalosporins is fused to a six-member ring, rather than the five-member ring found in penicillins. This chemical difference provides cephalosporins with an increased resistance to enzymatic inactivation by  **β-lactamases**. The drug  **cephalosporin C** was originally isolated from the fungus  **Cephalosporium acremonium** in the 1950s and has a similar  **spectrum of activity** to that of penicillin against gram-positive bacteria but is active against more gram-negative bacteria than  **penicillin**. Another important structural difference is that cephalosporin C possesses two R groups, compared with just one R group for penicillin, and this provides for greater diversity in chemical alterations and development of semisynthetic cephalosporins. The family of semisynthetic cephalosporins is much larger than the penicillins, and these drugs have been classified into generations based primarily on their spectrum of activity, increasing in spectrum from the narrow-spectrum, first-generation cephalosporins to the broad-spectrum, fourth-generation cephalosporins. A new fifth-generation cephalosporin has been developed that is active against  **methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**.

The  **carbapenems** and  **monobactams** also have a β-lactam ring as part of their core structure, and they inhibit the  **transpeptidase** activity of penicillin-binding proteins. The only monobactam used clinically is  **aztreonam**. It is a narrow-spectrum antibacterial with activity only against gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, the carbapenem family includes a variety of semisynthetic drugs ( **imipenem**,  **meropenem**, and  **doripenem**) that provide very broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

The drug  **vancomycin**, a member of a class of compounds called the  **glycopeptides**, was discovered in the 1950s as a natural antibiotic from the actinomycete  **Amycolatopsis orientalis**. Similar to the β-lactams, vancomycin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis and is bactericidal. However, in contrast to the β-lactams, the structure of vancomycin is not similar to that of cell-wall peptidoglycan subunits and does not directly inactivate penicillin-binding proteins. Rather, vancomycin is a very large, complex molecule that binds to the end of the peptide chain of cell wall precursors, creating a structural blockage that prevents the cell wall subunits from being incorporated into the growing N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM-NAG) backbone of the peptidoglycan structure ( **transglycosylation**). Vancomycin also structurally blocks  **transpeptidation**. Vancomycin is bactericidal against gram-positive bacterial pathogens, but it is not active against gram-negative bacteria because of its inability to penetrate the protective outer membrane.

The drug  **bacitracin** consists of a group of structurally similar peptide antibiotics originally isolated from  **Bacillus subtilis**. Bacitracin blocks the activity of a specific cell-membrane molecule that is responsible for the movement of  **peptidoglycan** precursors from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell, ultimately preventing their incorporation into the cell wall. Bacitracin is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including gram-positive organisms found on the skin, such as  *Staphylococcus* and  *Streptococcus*. Although it may be administered orally or intramuscularly in some circumstances, bacitracin has been shown to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys). Therefore, it is more commonly combined with  **neomycin** and  **polymyxin** in topical ointments such as  **Neosporin**.
