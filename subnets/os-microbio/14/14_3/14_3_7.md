name: Inhibitor of ATP Synthase

Bedaquiline, representing the synthetic antibacterial class of compounds called the  **diarylquinolines**, uses a novel mode of action that specifically inhibits mycobacterial growth. Although the specific mechanism has yet to be elucidated, this compound appears to interfere with the function of  **ATP** synthases, perhaps by interfering with the use of the hydrogen ion gradient for ATP synthesis by  **oxidative phosphorylation**, leading to reduced ATP production. Due to its  **side effects**, including  **hepatotoxicity** and potentially lethal heart arrhythmia, its use is reserved for serious, otherwise untreatable cases of  **tuberculosis**.
