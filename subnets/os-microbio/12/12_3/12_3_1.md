name: Whole Genome Methods and Pharmaceutical Applications of Genetic Engineering - Introduction

Advances in molecular biology have led to the creation of entirely new fields of science. Among these are fields that study aspects of whole genomes, collectively referred to as whole-genome methods. In this section, weâ€™ll provide a brief overview of the whole-genome fields of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.
