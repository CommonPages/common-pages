name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The science of  **genomics** allows researchers to study organisms on a holistic level and has many applications of medical relevance.
  *  **Transcriptomics** and  **proteomics** allow researchers to compare gene expression patterns between different cells and shows great promise in better understanding global responses to various conditions.
  * The various –omics technologies complement each other and together provide a more complete picture of an organism’s or microbial community’s ( **metagenomics**) state.
  * The analysis required for large data sets produced through genomics, transcriptomics, and  **proteomics** has led to the emergence of  **bioinformatics**.
  *  **Reporter genes** encoding easily observable characteristics are commonly used to track gene expression patterns of genes of unknown function.
  * The use of recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry, allowing for the rapid production of high-quality  **recombinant DNA pharmaceuticals** used to treat a wide variety of human conditions.
  *  **RNA interference** technology has great promise as a method of treating viral infections by silencing the expression of specific genes
