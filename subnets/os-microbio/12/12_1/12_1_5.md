name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Biotechology** is the science of utilizing living systems to benefit humankind. In recent years, the ability to directly alter an organismâ€™s genome through  **genetic**  **engineering** has been made possible due to advances in  **recombinant DNA technology,** which allows researchers to create  **recombinant DNA molecules** with new combinations of genetic material.
  *  **Molecular cloning** involves methods used to construct recombinant DNA and facilitate their replication in host organisms. These methods include the use of  **restriction enzymes** (to cut both foreign DNA and  **plasmid vectors)**,  **ligation** (to paste fragments of DNA together), and the introduction of recombinant DNA into a host organism (often bacteria).
  *  **Blue-white screening** allows selection of bacterial transformants that contain recombinant plasmids using the phenotype of a  **reporter gene** that is disabled by insertion of the DNA fragment.
  *  **Genomic libraries** can be made by cloning genomic fragments from one organism into plasmid vectors or into bacteriophage.
  *  **cDNA libraries** can be generated to represent the mRNA molecules expressed in a cell at a given point.
  *  **Transfection** of eukaryotic hosts can be achieved through various methods using  **electroporation**,  **gene guns**,  **microinjection**,  **shuttle vectors**, and  **viral vectors**.
