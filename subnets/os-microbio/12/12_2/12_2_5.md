name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Finding a gene of interest within a sample requires the use of a single-stranded  **DNA probe** labeled with a molecular beacon (typically radioactivity or fluorescence) that can hybridize with a complementary single-stranded nucleic acid in the sample.
  *  **Agarose gel electrophoresis** allows for the separation of DNA molecules based on size.
  *  **Restriction fragment length polymorphism**  **(RFLP)** analysis allows for the visualization by agarose gel electrophoresis of distinct variants of a DNA sequence caused by differences in restriction sites.
  *  **Southern blot** analysis allows researchers to find a particular DNA sequence within a sample whereas  **northern blot** analysis allows researchers to detect a particular mRNA sequence expressed in a sample.
  *  **Microarray technology** is a nucleic acid hybridization technique that allows for the examination of many thousands of genes at once to find differences in genes or gene expression patterns between two samples of genomic DNA or cDNA,
  *  **Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)** allows for the separation of proteins by size, especially if native protein charges are masked through pretreatment with SDS.
  *  **Polymerase chain reaction** allows for the rapid amplification of a specific DNA sequence. Variations of PCR can be used to detect mRNA expression ( **reverse transcriptase PCR**) or to quantify a particular sequence in the original sample  **(real-time PCR**).
  * Although the development of  **Sanger DNA sequencing** was revolutionary, advances in  **next generation sequencing** allow for the rapid and inexpensive sequencing of the genomes of many organisms, accelerating the volume of new sequence data.
