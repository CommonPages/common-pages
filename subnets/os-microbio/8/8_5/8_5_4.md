name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Collectively, microbes have the ability to degrade a wide variety of carbon sources besides carbohydrates, including lipids and proteins. The catabolic pathways for all of these molecules eventually connect into glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.
  * Several types of lipids can be microbially degraded. Triglycerides are degraded by extracellular  **lipases**, releasing fatty acids from the glycerol backbone. Phospholipids are degraded by  **phospholipases**, releasing fatty acids and the phosphorylated head group from the glycerol backbone. Lipases and phospholipases act as virulence factors for certain pathogenic microbes.
  * Fatty acids can be further degraded inside the cell through  **Î²-oxidation**, which sequentially removes two-carbon acetyl groups from the ends of fatty acid chains.
  * Protein degradation involves extracellular  **proteases** that degrade large proteins into smaller peptides. Detection of the extracellular proteases gelatinase and caseinase can be used to differentiate clinically relevant bacteria.
