name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Fermentation uses an organic molecule as a final electron acceptor to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> from NADH so that glycolysis can continue.
  * Fermentation does not involve an electron transport system, and no ATP is made by the fermentation process directly. Fermenters make very little ATPâ€”only two ATP molecules per glucose molecule during glycolysis.
  * Microbial fermentation processes have been used for the production of foods and pharmaceuticals, and for the identification of microbes.
  * During lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate accepts electrons from NADH and is reduced to lactic acid. Microbes performing  **homolactic fermentation** produce only lactic acid as the fermentation product; microbes performing  **heterolactic fermentation** produce a mixture of lactic acid, ethanol and/or acetic acid, and CO<sub>2</sub>.
  * Lactic acid production by the normal microbiota prevents growth of pathogens in certain body regions and is important for the health of the gastrointestinal tract.
  * During ethanol fermentation, pyruvate is first decarboxylated (releasing CO<sub>2</sub>) to acetaldehyde, which then accepts electrons from NADH, reducing acetaldehyde to ethanol. Ethanol fermentation is used for the production of alcoholic beverages, for making bread products rise, and for biofuel production.
  * Fermentation products of pathways (e.g., propionic acid fermentation) provide distinctive flavors to food products. Fermentation is used to produce chemical solvents (acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation) and pharmaceuticals (mixed acid fermentation).
  * Specific types of microbes may be distinguished by their fermentation pathways and products. Microbes may also be differentiated according to the substrates they are able to ferment.
