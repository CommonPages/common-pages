name: Oxygenic and Anoxygenic Photosynthesis

For photosynthesis to continue, the electron lost from the reaction center pigment must be replaced. The source of this electron (H<sub>2</sub>A) differentiates the  **oxygenic photosynthesis** of plants and cyanobacteria from  **anoxygenic photosynthesis** carried out by other types of bacterial phototrophs ({'Figure_8_6_PhotoEquat Figure 8.6.PhotoEquat}). In oxygenic photosynthesis, H<sub>2</sub>O is split and supplies the electron to the reaction center. Because oxygen is generated as a byproduct and is released, this type of photosynthesis is referred to as oxygenic photosynthesis. However, when other reduced compounds serve as the electron donor, oxygen is not generated; these types of photosynthesis are called anoxygenic photosynthesis.

Photosystems have been classified into two types:  **photosystem I (PSI)** and  **photosystem II (PSII)** ({'Figure_8_6_PSI_PSII Figure 8.6.PSI.PSII}). Cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts have both photosystems, whereas anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria use only one of the photosystems. Both photosystems are excited by light energy simultaneously. If the cell requires both ATP and NADPH for biosynthesis, then it will carry out  **noncyclic photophosphorylation**. Upon passing of the PSII reaction center electron to the ETS that connects PSII and PSI, the lost electron from the PSII reaction center is replaced by the splitting of water. The excited PSI reaction center electron is used to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH and is replaced by the electron exiting the ETS. The flow of electrons in this way is called the  **Z-scheme**.

If a cell’s need for ATP is significantly greater than its need for NADPH, it may bypass the production of reducing power through  **cyclic photophosphorylation**. Only PSI is used during cyclic photophosphorylation; the high-energy electron of the PSI reaction center is passed to an ETS carrier and then ultimately returns to the oxidized PSI reaction center pigment, thereby reducing it.
