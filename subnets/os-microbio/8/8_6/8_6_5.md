name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Heterotrophs depend on the carbohydrates produced by autotrophs, many of which are photosynthetic, converting solar energy into chemical energy.
  * Different photosynthetic organisms use different mixtures of  **photosynthetic pigments**, which increase the range of the wavelengths of light an organism can absorb.
  *  **Photosystems** (PSI and PSII) each contain a  **light-harvesting complex**, composed of multiple proteins and associated pigments that absorb light energy. The  **light-dependent reactions** of photosynthesis convert solar energy into chemical energy, producing ATP and NADPH or NADH to temporarily store this energy.
  * In  **oxygenic photosynthesis**, H<sub>2</sub>O serves as the electron donor to replace the reaction center electron, and oxygen is formed as a byproduct. In  **anoxygenic photosynthesis**, other reduced molecules like H<sub>2</sub>S or thiosulfate may be used as the electron donor; as such, oxygen is not formed as a byproduct.
  *  **Noncyclic photophosphorylation** is used in oxygenic photosynthesis when there is a need for both ATP and NADPH production. If a cellâ€™s needs for ATP outweigh its needs for NADPH, then it may carry out  **cyclic photophosphorylation** instead, producing only ATP.
  * The  **light-independent reactions** of photosynthesis use the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to fix CO<sub>2</sub> into organic sugar molecules.
