    Heterotrophic organisms ranging from  *E. coli* to humans rely on the chemical energy found mainly in carbohydrate molecules. Many of these carbohydrates are produced by  **photosynthesis**, the biochemical process by which phototrophic organisms convert solar energy (sunlight) into chemical energy. Although photosynthesis is most commonly associated with plants, microbial photosynthesis is also a significant supplier of chemical energy, fueling many diverse ecosystems. In this section, we will focus on microbial photosynthesis.
    
    Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions ({'Figure_8_6_LightDepIn Figure 8.6.LightDepIn}). In the  **light-dependent reaction** **s**, energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigment molecules in photosynthetic membranes and converted into stored chemical energy. In the  **light-independent reaction** **s**, the chemical energy produced by the light-dependent reactions is used to drive the assembly of sugar molecules using CO<sub>2</sub>; however, these reactions are still light dependent because the products of the light-dependent reactions necessary for driving them are short-lived. The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and either NADPH or NADH to temporarily store energy. These energy carriers are used in the light-independent reactions to drive the energetically unfavorable process of “fixing” inorganic CO<sub>2</sub> in an organic form, sugar.
