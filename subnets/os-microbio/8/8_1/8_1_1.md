name: Energy, Matter, and Enzymes - Introduction

The term used to describe all of the chemical reactions inside a cell is  **metabolism** ({'Figure_8_1_metabolism Figure 8.1.metabolism}). Cellular processes such as the building or breaking down of complex molecules occur through series of stepwise, interconnected chemical reactions called  **metabolic pathway**s. Reactions that are spontaneous and release energy are  **exergonic reaction**s, whereas  **endergonic reaction**s require energy to proceed. The term  **anabolism** refers to those endergonic metabolic pathways involved in  **biosynthesis**, converting simple molecular building blocks into more complex molecules, and fueled by the use of cellular energy. Conversely, the term  **catabolism** refers to exergonic pathways that break down complex molecules into simpler ones. Molecular energy stored in the bonds of complex molecules is released in catabolic pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be used to produce high-energy molecules, which are used to drive anabolic pathways. Thus, in terms of energy and molecules, cells are continually balancing catabolism with anabolism.
