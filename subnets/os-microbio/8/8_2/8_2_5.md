name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Glycolysis** is the first step in the breakdown of glucose, resulting in the formation of ATP, which is produced by  **substrate-level phosphorylation**; NADH; and two pyruvate molecules. Glycolysis does not use oxygen and is not oxygen dependent.
  * After glycolysis, a three-carbon pyruvate is decarboxylated to form a two-carbon acetyl group, coupled with the formation of NADH. The acetyl group is attached to a large carrier compound called coenzyme A.
  * After the transition step, coenzyme A transports the two-carbon acetyl to the  **Krebs cycle**, where the two carbons enter the cycle. Per turn of the cycle, one acetyl group derived from glycolysis is further oxidized, producing three NADH molecules, one FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one ATP by  **substrate-level phosphorylation**, and releasing two CO<sub>2</sub> molecules.
  * The Krebs cycle may be used for other purposes. Many of the intermediates are used to synthesize important cellular molecules, including amino acids, chlorophylls, fatty acids, and nucleotides.
