name: Other Glycolytic Pathways

When we refer to glycolysis, unless otherwise indicated, we are referring to the EMP pathway used by animals and many bacteria. However, some prokaryotes use alternative glycolytic pathways. One important alternative is the  **Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway**, named after its discoverers Nathan Entner and Michael Doudoroff (1911â€“1975). Although some bacteria, including the opportunistic gram-negative pathogen  **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**, contain only the ED pathway for glycolysis, other bacteria, like  *E. coli*, have the ability to use either the ED pathway or the EMP pathway.

A third type of glycolytic pathway that occurs in all cells, which is quite different from the previous two pathways, is the  **pentose phosphate pathway** ( **PPP**) also called the  **phosphogluconate pathway** or the  **hexose monophosphate shunt**. Evidence suggests that the PPP may be the most ancient universal glycolytic pathway. The intermediates from the PPP are used for the  **biosynthesis** of nucleotides and amino acids. Therefore, this glycolytic pathway may be favored when the cell has need for nucleic acid and/or protein synthesis, respectively. A discussion and illustration of the complete ED pathway and PPP with chemical structures and enzyme names appear in <link:>.
