/ Catabolism of Carbohydrates

  >
    Extensive enzyme pathways exist for breaking down  **carbohydrate**s to capture energy in  **ATP** bonds. In addition, many catabolic pathways produce intermediate molecules that are also used as building blocks for  **anabolism**. Understanding these processes is important for several reasons. First, because the main metabolic processes involved are common to a wide range of chemoheterotrophic organisms, we can learn a great deal about human metabolism by studying metabolism in more easily manipulated bacteria like  *E. coli*. Second, because animal and human pathogens are also  **chemoheterotroph**s, learning about the details of  **metabolism** in these bacteria, including possible differences between bacterial and human pathways, is useful for the diagnosis of pathogens as well as for the discovery of antimicrobial therapies targeting specific pathogens. Last, learning specifically about the pathways involved in chemoheterotrophic metabolism also serves as a basis for comparing other more unusual metabolic strategies used by microbes. Although the chemical source of electrons initiating  **electron transfer** is different between chemoheterorophs and  **chemoautotroph**s, many similar processes are used in both types of organisms.
    
    The typical example used to introduce concepts of metabolism to students is carbohydrate catabolism. For chemoheterotrophs, our examples of metabolism start with the catabolism of polysaccharides such as glycogen, starch, or cellulose. Enzymes such as amylase, which breaks down glycogen or starch, and cellulases, which break down cellulose, can cause the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between the glucose monomers in these polymers, releasing glucose for further catabolism.
