name: Sulfur Cycle

Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living organisms. As part of the amino acids cysteine and methionine, it is involved in the formation of proteins. It is also found in several vitamins necessary for the synthesis of important biological molecules like  **coenzyme A**. Several groups of microbes are responsible for carrying out processes involved in the  **sulfur cycle** ({'Figure_8_7_SCycle Figure 8.7.SCycle}). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as chemoautotrophic archaea and bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an  **electron donor**, oxidizing it first to elemental sulfur (S<sup>0</sup>), then to sulfate <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:bib="http://bibtexml.sf.net/" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><msub><mtext>SO</mtext><mn>4</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>âˆ’</mo></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> This leads to stratification of hydrogen sulfide in soil, with levels increasing at deeper, more anaerobic depths.

Many bacteria and plants can use sulfate as a sulfur source. Decomposition dead organisms by fungi and bacteria remove sulfur groups from amino acids, producing hydrogen sulfide, returning inorganic sulfur to the environment.
