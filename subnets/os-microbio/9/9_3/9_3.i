    Yogurt, pickles, sauerkraut, and lime-seasoned dishes all owe their tangy taste to a high acid content ({'Figure_9_3_yogurt Figure 9.3.yogurt}). Recall that acidity is a function of the concentration of hydrogen ions [H<sup>+</sup>] and is measured as pH. Environments with pH values below 7.0 are considered acidic, whereas those with pH values above 7.0 are considered basic. Extreme pH affects the structure of all macromolecules. The hydrogen bonds holding together strands of DNA break up at high pH. Lipids are hydrolyzed by an extremely basic pH. The proton motive force responsible for production of ATP in cellular respiration depends on the concentration gradient of H<sup>+</sup> across the plasma membrane (see <link:>). If H<sup>+</sup> ions are neutralized by hydroxide ions, the concentration gradient collapses and impairs energy production. But the component most sensitive to pH in the cell is its workhorse, the protein. Moderate changes in pH modify the ionization of amino-acid functional groups and disrupt hydrogen bonding, which, in turn, promotes changes in the folding of the molecule, promoting denaturation and destroying activity.
    
    
            
    
    The  **optimum growth pH** is the most favorable pH for the growth of an organism. The lowest pH value that an organism can tolerate is called the  **minimum growth pH** and the highest pH is the  **maximum growth pH**. These values can cover a wide range, which is important for the preservation of food and to microorganisms’ survival in the stomach. For example, the optimum growth pH of  *Salmonella* spp. is 7.0–7.5, but the minimum growth pH is closer to 4.2.
    
    Most bacteria are  **neutrophile**s, meaning they grow optimally at a pH within one or two pH units of the neutral pH of 7 (see {'Figure_9_3_pH Figure 9.3.pH}). Most familiar bacteria, like  **Escherichia coli**, staphylococci, and  **Salmonella** spp. are neutrophiles and do not fare well in the acidic pH of the stomach. However, there are pathogenic strains of  *E. coli, S. typhi,* and other species of intestinal pathogens that are much more resistant to stomach acid. In comparison, fungi thrive at slightly acidic pH values of 5.0–6.0.
    
    Microorganisms that grow optimally at pH less than 5.55 are called  **acidophile**s. For example, the sulfur-oxidizing  **Sulfolobus** spp. isolated from sulfur mud fields and hot springs in Yellowstone National Park are extreme acidophiles. These archaea survive at pH values of 2.5–3.5. Species of the archaean genus  **Ferroplasma** live in acid mine drainage at pH values of 0–2.9.  **Lactobacillus** bacteria, which are an important part of the normal microbiota of the vagina, can tolerate acidic environments at pH values 3.5–6.8 and also contribute to the acidity of the vagina (pH of 4, except at the onset of menstruation) through their metabolic production of lactic acid. The vagina’s acidity plays an important role in inhibiting other microbes that are less tolerant of acidity. Acidophilic microorganisms display a number of adaptations to survive in strong acidic environments. For example, proteins show increased negative surface charge that stabilizes them at low pH. Pumps actively eject H<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cells. The changes in the composition of membrane phospholipids probably reflect the need to maintain membrane fluidity at low pH.
    
    
            
    
    At the other end of the spectrum are  **alkaliphile**s, microorganisms that grow best at pH between 8.0 and 10.5.  **Vibrio cholerae**, the pathogenic agent of  **cholera**, grows best at the slightly basic pH of 8.0; it can survive pH values of 11.0 but is inactivated by the acid of the stomach. When it comes to survival at high pH, the bright pink archaean  **Natronobacterium**, found in the soda lakes of the African Rift Valley, may hold the record at a pH of 10.5 ({'Figure_9_3_natronL Figure 9.3.natronL}). Extreme alkaliphiles have adapted to their harsh environment through evolutionary modification of lipid and protein structure and compensatory mechanisms to maintain the proton motive force in an alkaline environment. For example, the alkaliphile  **Bacillus firmus** derives the energy for transport reactions and motility from a Na<sup>+</sup> ion gradient rather than a proton motive force. Many enzymes from alkaliphiles have a higher isoelectric point, due to an increase in the number of basic amino acids, than homologous enzymes from neutrophiles.
