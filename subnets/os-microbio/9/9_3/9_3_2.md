name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Bacteria are generally  **neutrophiles**. They grow best at neutral pH close to 7.0.
  *  **Acidophiles** grow optimally at a pH near 3.0.  **Alkaliphiles** are organisms that grow optimally between a pH of 8 and 10.5. Extreme acidophiles and alkaliphiles grow slowly or not at all near neutral pH.
  * Microorganisms grow best at their  **optimum growth pH**. Growth occurs slowly or not at all below the  **minimum growth pH** and above the  **maximum growth pH**.
