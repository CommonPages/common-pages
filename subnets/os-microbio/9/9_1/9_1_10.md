name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Most bacterial cells divide by  **binary fission**.  **Generation time** in bacterial growth is defined as the  **doubling time** of the population.
  * Cells in a closed system follow a pattern of growth with four phases:  **lag**,  **logarithmic (exponential)**,  **stationary**, and  **death**.
  * Cells can be counted by  **direct viable cell count**. The  **pour plate** and  **spread plate** methods are used to plate  **serial dilutions** into or onto, respectively, agar to allow counting of viable cells that give rise to  **colony-forming units**.  **Membrane filtration** is used to count live cells in dilute solutions. The  **most probable cell number (MPN)** method allows estimation of cell numbers in cultures without using solid media.
  * Indirect methods can be used to estimate  **culture density** by measuring  **turbidity** of a culture or live cell density by measuring metabolic activity.
  * Other patterns of cell division include multiple nucleoid formation in cells; asymmetric division, as in  **budding**; and the formation of hyphae and terminal spores.
  *  **Biofilms** are communities of microorganisms enmeshed in a matrix of  **extracellular polymeric substance**. The formation of a biofilm occurs when  **planktonic** cells attach to a substrate and become  **sessile**. Cells in biofilms coordinate their activity by communicating through  **quorum sensing**.
  * Biofilms are commonly found on surfaces in nature and in the human body, where they may be beneficial or cause severe infections. Pathogens associated with biofilms are often more resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants.
