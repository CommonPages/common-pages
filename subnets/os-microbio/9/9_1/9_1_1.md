name: How Microbes Grow - Introduction

The bacterial cell cycle involves the formation of new cells through the replication of DNA and partitioning of cellular components into two daughter cells. In prokaryotes, reproduction is always asexual, although extensive genetic recombination in the form of horizontal gene transfer takes place, as will be explored in a different chapter. Most bacteria have a single circular chromosome; however, some exceptions exist. For example,  **Borrelia burgdorferi**, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has a linear chromosome.
