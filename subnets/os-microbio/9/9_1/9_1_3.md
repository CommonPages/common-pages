name: Generation Time

In eukaryotic organisms, the generation time is the time between the same points of the life cycle in two successive generations. For example, the typical generation time for the human population is 25 years. This definition is not practical for bacteria, which may reproduce rapidly or remain dormant for thousands of years. In prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea), the  **generation time** is also called the  **doubling time** and is defined as the time it takes for the population to double through one round of binary fission. Bacterial doubling times vary enormously. Whereas  *Escherichia coli* can double in as little as 20 minutes under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, bacteria of the same species may need several days to double in especially harsh environments. Most pathogens grow rapidly, like  *E. coli*, but there are exceptions. For example,  **Mycobacterium tuberculosis**, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has a generation time of between 15 and 20 hours. On the other hand,  *M. leprae*, which causes  **Hansenâ€™s disease** (leprosy), grows much more slowly, with a doubling time of 14 days.
