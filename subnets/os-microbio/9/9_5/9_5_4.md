  *  **Halophiles** require high salt concentration in the medium, whereas  **halotolerant** organisms can grow and multiply in the presence of high salt but do not require it for growth.
  * Halotolerant pathogens are an important source of foodborne illnesses because they contaminate foods preserved in salt.
  * Photosynthetic bacteria depend on visible light for energy.
  * Most bacteria, with few exceptions, require high moisture to grow.
