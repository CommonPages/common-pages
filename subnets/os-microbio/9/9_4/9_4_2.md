name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Microorganisms thrive at a wide range of temperatures; they have colonized different natural environments and have adapted to extreme temperatures. Both extreme cold and hot temperatures require evolutionary adjustments to macromolecules and biological processes.
  *  **Psychrophiles** grow best in the temperature range of 0–15 °C whereas  **psychrotrophs** thrive between 4°C and 25 °C.
  *  **Mesophiles** grow best at moderate temperatures in the range of 20 °C to about 45 °C. Pathogens are usually mesophiles.
  *  **Thermophiles** and  **hyperthemophiles** are adapted to life at temperatures above 50 °C.
  * Adaptations to cold and hot temperatures require changes in the composition of membrane lipids and proteins.
