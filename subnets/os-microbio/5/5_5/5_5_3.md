name: Lichen Diversity

Lichens are classified as fungi and the fungal partners belong to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Lichens can also be grouped into types based on their morphology. There are three major types of lichens, although other types exist as well. Lichens that are tightly attached to the substrate, giving them a crusty appearance, are called  **crustose lichens**. Those that have leaf-like lobes are  **foliose lichens**; they may only be attached at one point in the growth form, and they also have a second cortex below the medulla. Finally,  **fruticose lichens** have rounded structures and an overall branched appearance. {'Figure_5_5_lichens Figure 5.5.lichens} shows an example of each of the forms of lichens.
