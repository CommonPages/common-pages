name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * The fungi include diverse saprotrophic eukaryotic organisms with chitin cell walls
  * Fungi can be unicellular or multicellular; some (like yeast) and fungal spores are microscopic, whereas some are large and conspicuous
  * Reproductive types are important in distinguishing fungal groups
  * Medically important species exist in the four fungal groups Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Microsporidia
  * Members of Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota produce deadly toxins
  * Important differences in fungal cells, such as ergosterols in fungal membranes, can be targets for antifungal medications, but similarities between human and fungal cells make it difficult to find targets for medications and these medications often have toxic adverse effects
