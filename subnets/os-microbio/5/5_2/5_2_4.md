name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Helminth parasites are included within the study of microbiology because they are often identified by looking for microscopic eggs and larvae.
  * The two major groups of helminth parasites are the roundworms (Nematoda) and the flatworms (Platyhelminthes).
  * Nematodes are common intestinal parasites often transmitted through undercooked foods, although they are also found in other environments.
  * Platyhelminths include  **tapeworms** and  **flukes**, which are often transmitted through undercooked meat.
