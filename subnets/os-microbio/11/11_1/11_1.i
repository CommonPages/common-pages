/ The Functions of Genetic Material

    DNA serves two essential functions that deal with cellular information. First,  **DNA** is the genetic material responsible for  **inheritance** and is passed from parent to offspring for all life on earth. To preserve the integrity of this genetic information, DNA must be replicated with great accuracy, with minimal errors that introduce changes to the DNA sequence. A genome contains the full complement of DNA within a cell and is organized into smaller, discrete units called  **gene**s that are arranged on  **chromosome**s and  **plasmid**s. The second function of DNA is to direct and regulate the construction of the proteins necessary to a cell for growth and reproduction in a particular cellular environment.
    
    A gene is composed of DNA that is “read” or transcribed to produce an RNA molecule during the process of  **transcription**. One major type of RNA molecule, called  **messenger RNA** (mRNA), provides the information for the  **ribosome** to catalyze  **protein synthesis** in a process called  **translation**. The processes of transcription and translation are collectively referred to as  **gene expression**. Gene expression is the synthesis of a specific protein with a sequence of amino acids that is encoded in the gene. The flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein is described by the  **central dogma** ({'Figure_11_1_CentDogma Figure 11.1.CentDogma}). This central dogma of molecular biology further elucidates the mechanism behind  **Beadle and Tatum**’s “one gene-one enzyme” hypothesis (see <link:>). Each of the processes of replication, transcription, and translation includes the stages of 1) initiation, 2) elongation (polymerization), and 3) termination. These stages will be described in more detail in this chapter.
    
    
            
    
    A cell’s  **genotype** is the full collection of genes it contains, whereas its  **phenotype** is the set of observable characteristics that result from those genes. The phenotype is the product of the array of proteins being produced by the cell at a given time, which is influenced by the cell’s genotype as well as interactions with the cell’s environment. Genes code for proteins that have functions in the cell. Production of a specific protein encoded by an individual gene often results in a distinct phenotype for the cell compared with the phenotype without that protein. For this reason, it is also common to refer to the genotype of an individual gene and its phenotype. Although a cell’s genotype remains constant, not all genes are used to direct the production of their proteins simultaneously. Cells carefully regulate expression of their genes, only using genes to make specific proteins when those proteins are needed ({'Figure_11_1_GenoPheno Figure 11.1.GenoPheno}).
