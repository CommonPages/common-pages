name: Other Factors Affecting Gene Expression in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes

Although the focus on our discussion of transcriptional control used prokaryotic operons as examples, eukaryotic transcriptional control is similar in many ways. As in prokaryotes, eukaryotic transcription can be controlled through the binding of transcription factors including  **repressor**s and  **activator**s. Interestingly, eukaryotic transcription can be influenced by the binding of proteins to regions of DNA, called  **enhancer**s, rather far away from the gene, through DNA looping facilitated between the enhancer and the promoter ({'Figure_11_7_Enhancer Figure 11.7.Enhancer}). Overall, regulating transcription is a highly effective way to control gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the control of gene expression in eukaryotes in response to environmental and cellular stresses can be accomplished in additional ways without the binding of transcription factors to regulatory regions.

## DNA-Level Control

In eukaryotes, the DNA molecules or associated histones can be chemically modified in such a way as to influence transcription; this is called  **epigenetic regulation**. Methylation of certain cytosine nucleotides in DNA in response to environmental factors has been shown to influence use of such DNA for transcription, with  **DNA methylation** commonly correlating to lowered levels of gene expression. Additionally, in response to environmental factors,  **histone** proteins for packaging DNA can also be chemically modified in multiple ways, including  **acetylation** and deacetylation, influencing the packaging state of DNA and thus affecting the availability of loosely wound DNA for transcription. These chemical modifications can sometimes be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division, making at least some of these epigenetic changes heritable.
