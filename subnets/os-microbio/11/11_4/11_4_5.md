name: Protein Targeting, Folding, and Modification

During and after translation, polypeptides may need to be modified before they are biologically active. Post-translational modifications include:

  1. removal of translated signal sequences—short tails of amino acids that aid in directing a protein to a specific cellular compartment
  2. proper “folding” of the polypeptide and association of multiple polypeptide subunits, often facilitated by chaperone proteins, into a distinct three-dimensional structure
  3. proteolytic processing of an inactive polypeptide to release an active protein component, and
  4. various chemical modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, or glycosylation) of individual amino acids.
