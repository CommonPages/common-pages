name: Protein Synthesis (Translation) - Introduction

The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cellâ€™s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other macromolecule of living organisms. They perform virtually every function of a cell, serving as both functional (e.g., enzymes) and structural elements. The process of  **translation**, or  **protein synthesis**, the second part of gene expression, involves the decoding by a ribosome of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product.
