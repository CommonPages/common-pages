name: Mutations - Introduction

A  **mutation** is a heritable change in the DNA sequence of an organism. The resulting organism, called a  **mutant**, may have a recognizable change in  **phenotype** compared to the  **wild type**, which is the phenotype most commonly observed in nature. A change in the DNA sequence is conferred to mRNA through transcription, and may lead to an altered amino acid sequence in a protein on translation. Because proteins carry out the vast majority of cellular functions, a change in amino acid sequence in a protein may lead to an altered phenotype for the cell and organism.
