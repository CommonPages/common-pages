name: Effects of Mutations on DNA Sequence

There are several types of mutations that are classified according to how the DNA molecule is altered. One type, called a  **point mutation**, affects a single base and most commonly occurs when one base is substituted or replaced by another. Mutations also result from the addition of one or more bases, known as an  **insertion**, or the removal of one or more bases, known as a  **deletion**.
