name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * During  **transcription**, the information encoded in DNA is used to make RNA.
  *  **RNA polymerase** synthesizes RNA, using the antisense strand of the DNA as template by adding complementary RNA nucleotides to the 3’ end of the growing strand.
  * RNA polymerase binds to DNA at a sequence called a  **promoter** during the  **initiation of transcription**.
  * Genes encoding proteins of related functions are frequently transcribed under the control of a single promoter in prokaryotes, resulting in the formation of a  **polycistronic mRNA** molecule that encodes multiple polypeptides.
  * Unlike DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase does not require a 3’-OH group to add nucleotides, so a  **primer** is not needed during initiation.
  *  **Termination of transcription** in bacteria occurs when the RNA polymerase encounters specific DNA sequences that lead to stalling of the polymerase. This results in release of RNA polymerase from the DNA template strand, freeing the  **RNA transcript**.
  * Eukaryotes have three different RNA polymerases. Eukaryotes also have monocistronic mRNA, each encoding only a single polypeptide.
  * Eukaryotic primary transcripts are processed in several ways, including the addition of a  **5’ cap** and a 3′- **poly-A tail**, as well as  **splicing**, to generate a mature mRNA molecule that can be transported out of the nucleus and that is protected from degradation.
