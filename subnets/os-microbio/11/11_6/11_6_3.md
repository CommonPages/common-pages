name: Transduction

Viruses that infect bacteria ( **bacteriophages**) may also move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium to another in a process called  **transduction** (see {'Figure_6_2_transd Figure 6.2.transd}). Recall that in  **generalized transduction**, any piece of chromosomal DNA may be transferred to a new host cell by accidental packaging of chromosomal DNA into a phage head during phage assembly. By contrast,  **specialized transduction** results from the imprecise excision of a lysogenic prophage from the bacterial chromosome such that it carries with it a piece of the bacterial chromosome from either side of the phage’s integration site to a new host cell. As a result, the host may acquire new properties. This process is called lysogenic conversion. Of medical significance, a lysogenic phage may carry with it a  **virulence gene** to its new host. Once inserted into the new host’s chromosome, the new host may gain pathogenicity. Several pathogenic bacteria, including  **Corynebacterium diphtheriae** (the causative agent of diphtheria) and  **Clostridium botulinum** (the causative agent of botulism), are virulent because of the introduction of toxin-encoding genes by lysogenic bacteriophages, affirming the clinical relevance of transduction in the exchange of genes involved in infectious disease. Archaea have their own viruses that translocate genetic material from one individual to another.
