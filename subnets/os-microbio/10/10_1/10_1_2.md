name: Discovery and Characterization of DNA

Modern understanding of DNA has evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s, Friedrich  **Miescher** (1844–1895), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphorus-rich chemicals from leukocytes (white blood cells) from the pus on used bandages from a local surgical clinic. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) “ **nuclein**” because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells. His student Richard  **Altmann** (1852–1900) subsequently termed it “ **nucleic acid**” 20 years later when he discovered the acidic nature of nuclein. In the last two decades of the 19th century, German biochemist Albrecht  **Kossel** (1853–1927) isolated and characterized the five different  **nucleotide bases** composing nucleic acid. These are adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine (in DNA), and uracil (in RNA). Kossell received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his work on nucleic acids and for his considerable work on proteins, including the discovery of  **histidine**.
