name: Viral Genomes

Viral genomes exhibit significant diversity in structure. Some viruses have genomes that consist of DNA as their genetic material. This  **DNA** may be single stranded, as exemplified by human  **parvoviruses**, or double stranded, as seen in the  **herpesviruses**and  **poxviruses**. Additionally, although all cellular life uses DNA as its genetic material, some  **viral genomes** are made of either single-stranded or double-stranded RNA molecules, as we have discussed. Viral genomes are typically smaller than most bacterial genomes, encoding only a few genes, because they rely on their hosts to carry out many of the functions required for their  **replication**. The diversity of viral genome structures and their implications for viral replication life cycles are discussed in more detail in <link:>.
