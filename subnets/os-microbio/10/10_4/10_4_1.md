name: Structure and Function of Cellular Genomes - Introduction

Thus far, we have discussed the structure and function of individual pieces of  **DNA** and  **RNA**. In this section, we will discuss how all of an organism’s genetic material—collectively referred to as its  **genome**—is organized inside of the cell. Since an organism’s  **genetics** to a large extent dictate its characteristics, it should not be surprising that organisms differ in the arrangement of their DNA and RNA.
