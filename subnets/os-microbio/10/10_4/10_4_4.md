name: Noncoding DNA

In addition to genes, a genome also contains many regions of  **noncoding DNA** that do not encode proteins or stable RNA products. Noncoding DNA is commonly found in areas prior to the start of coding sequences of genes as well as in  **intergenic regions** (i.e., DNA sequences located between genes) ({'Figure_10_4_noncodDNA Figure 10.4.noncodDNA}).

Prokaryotes appear to use their genomes very efficiently, with only an average of 12% of the genome being taken up by noncoding sequences. In contrast, noncoding DNA can represent about 98% of the genome in eukaryotes, as seen in humans, but the percentage of noncoding DNA varies between species. These noncoding DNA regions were once referred to as “junk DNA”; however, this terminology is no longer widely accepted because scientists have since found roles for some of these regions, many of which contribute to the regulation of  **transcription** or  **translation** through the production of small noncoding RNA molecules,  **DNA packaging**, and chromosomal stability. Although scientists may not fully understand the roles of all noncoding regions of DNA, it is generally believed that they do have purposes within the cell.
