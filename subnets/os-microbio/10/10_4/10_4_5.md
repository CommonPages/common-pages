name: Extrachromosomal DNA

Although most DNA is contained within a cellâ€™s chromosomes, many cells have additional molecules of DNA outside the chromosomes, called  **extrachromosomal DNA**, that are also part of its genome. The genomes of eukaryotic cells would also include the chromosomes from any organelles such as mitochondria and/or chloroplasts that these cells maintain ({'Figure_10_4_Extrachrom Figure 10.4.Extrachrom}). The maintenance of circular chromosomes in these organelles is a vestige of their prokaryotic origins and supports the  **endosymbiotic theory** (see <link:>). In some cases, genomes of certain DNA viruses can also be maintained independently in host cells during latent viral infection. In these cases, these viruses are another form of extrachromosomal DNA. For example, the human papillomavirus (HPV) may be maintained in infected cells in this way.

Besides chromosomes, some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called  **plasmids** that may contain one or a few genes not essential for normal growth ({'Figure_3_3_ProkCell Figure 3.3.ProkCell}). Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria in a process known as  **horizontal gene transfer (HGT)**. The exchange of genetic material on plasmids sometimes provides microbes with new genes beneficial for growth and survival under special conditions. In some cases, genes obtained from plasmids may have clinical implications, encoding virulence factors that give a microbe the ability to cause disease or make a microbe resistant to certain antibiotics. Plasmids are also used heavily in genetic engineering and biotechnology as a way to move genes from one cell to another. The role of plasmids in horizontal gene transfer and biotechnology will be discussed further in <link:> and <link:>.
