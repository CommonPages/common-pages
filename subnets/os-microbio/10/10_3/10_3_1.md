name: Structure and Function of RNA - Introduction

Structurally speaking,  **ribonucleic acid (RNA)**, is quite similar to DNA. However, whereas DNA molecules are typically long and double stranded, RNA molecules are much shorter and are typically single stranded. RNA molecules perform a variety of roles in the cell but are mainly involved in the process of  **protein synthesis** ( **translation**) and its regulation.
