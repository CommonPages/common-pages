name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Ribonucleic acid (RNA)** is typically single stranded and contains ribose as its pentose sugar and the pyrimidine uracil instead of thymine. An RNA strand can undergo significant intramolecular base pairing to take on a three-dimensional structure.
  * There are three main types of RNA, all involved in protein synthesis.
  * Messenger RNA ( **mRNA**) serves as the intermediary between DNA and the synthesis of protein products during translation.
  * Ribosomal RNA ( **rRNA**) is a type of stable RNA that is a major constituent of ribosomes. It ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes during protein synthesis and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids during protein synthesis.
  * Transfer RNA ( **tRNA**) is a small type of stable RNA that carries an amino acid to the corresponding site of protein synthesis in the ribosome. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain being synthesized.
  * Although RNA is not used for long-term genetic information in cells, many viruses do use RNA as their genetic material.
