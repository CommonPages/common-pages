name: RNA Structure

RNA is typically single stranded and is made of  **ribonucleotides** that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and a phosphate group. The subtle structural difference between the sugars gives DNA added stability, making DNA more suitable for storage of genetic information, whereas the relative instability of RNA makes it more suitable for its more short-term functions. The RNA-specific pyrimidine  **uracil** forms a complementary base pair with adenine and is used instead of the thymine used in DNA. Even though RNA is single stranded, most types of RNA molecules show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences within the RNA strand, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function ({'Figure_10_3_RNAStruct Figure 10.3.RNAStruct} and {'Figure_10_3_RNAStruct2 Figure 10.3.RNAStruct2}).
