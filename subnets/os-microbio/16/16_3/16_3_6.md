name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Reservoirs** of human disease can include the human and animal populations, soil, water, and inanimate objects or materials.
  *  **Contact transmission** can be  **direct** or  **indirect** through physical contact with either an infected host (direct) or contact with a fomite that an infected host has made contact with previously (indirect).
  * Vector transmission occurs when a living organism carries an infectious agent on its body ( **mechanical**) or as an infection host itself ( **biological**), to a new host.
  *  **Vehicle transmission** occurs when a substance, such as soil, water, or air, carries an infectious agent to a new host.
  *  **Healthcare-associated infections (HAI)**, or  **nosocomial infections**, are acquired in a clinical setting. Transmission is facilitated by medical interventions and the high concentration of susceptible, immunocompromised individuals in clinical settings.
