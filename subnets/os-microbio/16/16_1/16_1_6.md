name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Epidemiology** is the science underlying public health.
  *  **Morbidity** means being in a state of illness, whereas  **mortality** refers to death; both  **morbidity rates** and  **mortality rates** are of interest to epidemiologists.
  *  **Incidence** is the number of new cases (morbidity or mortality), usually expressed as a proportion, during a specified time period;  **prevalence** is the total number affected in the population, again usually expressed as a proportion.
  *  **Sporadic diseases** only occur rarely and largely without a geographic focus.  **Endemic diseases** occur at a constant (and often low) level within a population.  **Epidemic diseases** and  **pandemic diseases** occur when an outbreak occurs on a significantly larger than expected level, either locally or globally, respectively.
  *  **Koch’s postulates** specify the procedure for confirming a particular pathogen as the etiologic agent of a particular disease. Koch’s postulates have limitations in application if the microbe cannot be isolated and cultured or if there is no animal host for the microbe. In this case, molecular Koch’s postulates would be utilized.
  * In the United States, the  **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** monitors  **notifiable diseases** and publishes weekly updates in the  *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.*
