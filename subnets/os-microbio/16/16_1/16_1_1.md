name: The Language of Epidemiologists - Introduction

The field of  **epidemiology** concerns the geographical distribution and timing of infectious disease occurrences and how they are transmitted and maintained in nature, with the goal of recognizing and controlling outbreaks. The science of epidemiology includes  **etiology** (the study of the causes of disease) and investigation of disease transmission (mechanisms by which a disease is spread).
