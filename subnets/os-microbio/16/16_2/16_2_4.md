name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Early pioneers of epidemiology such as John Snow, Florence Nightingale, and Joseph Lister, studied disease at the population level and used data to disrupt disease transmission.
  *  **Descriptive epidemiology** studies rely on case analysis and patient histories to gain information about outbreaks, frequently while they are still occurring.
  *  **Retrospective epidemiology** studies use historical data to identify associations with the disease state of present cases.  **Prospective epidemiology** studies gather data and follow cases to find associations with future disease states.
  *  **Analytical epidemiology** studies are observational studies that are carefully designed to compare groups and uncover associations between environmental or genetic factors and disease.
  *  **Experimental epidemiology** studies generate strong evidence of causation in disease or treatment by manipulating subjects and comparing them with control subjects.
