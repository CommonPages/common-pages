name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * When present in the correct ratio, antibody and antigen will form a  **precipitin**, or lattice that precipitates out of solution.
  * A  **precipitin ring test** can be used to visualize lattice formation in solution. The  **Ouchterlony assay** demonstrates lattice formation in a gel. The  **radial immunodiffusion** assay is used to quantify antigen by measuring the size of a precipitation zone in a gel infused with antibodies.
  * Insoluble antigens in suspension will form  **flocculants** when bound by antibodies. This is the basis of the VDRL test for syphilis in which anti-treponemal antibodies bind to cardiolipin in suspension.
  * Viral infections can be detected by quantifying virus-neutralizing antibodies in a patientâ€™s serum.
  * Different antibody classes in plasma or serum are identified by using  **immunoelectrophoresis**.
  * The presence of specific antigens (e.g., bacterial or viral proteins) in serum can be demonstrated by  **western blot** assays, in which the proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and identified using labeled antibodies.
  * In the complement fixation test, complement is used to detect antibodies against various pathogens.
