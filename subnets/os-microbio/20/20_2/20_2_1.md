name: Detecting Antigen-Antibody Complexes - Introduction

Laboratory tests to detect antibodies and antigens outside of the body (e.g., in a test tube) are called  *in vitro* assays. When both antibodies and their corresponding antigens are present in a solution, we can often observe a precipitation reaction in which large complexes (lattices) form and settle out of solution. In the next several sections, we will discuss several common  *in vitro* assays.
