When a patient has elevated protein levels in the blood or is losing protein in the urine, a clinician will often order a  **polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis** ( **PAGE**) assay (see <link:>). This assay compares the relative abundance of the various types of serum proteins. Abnormal protein electrophoresis patterns can be further studied using  **immunoelectrophoresis (IEP)**. The IEP begins by running a PAGE. Antisera against selected serum proteins are added to troughs running parallel to the electrophoresis track, forming  **precipitin arcs** similar to those seen in an  **Ouchterlony assay** ({'Figure_20_2_IEP Figure 20.2.IEP}). This allows the identification of abnormal immunoglobulin proteins in the sample.

IEP is particularly useful in the diagnosis of  **multiple myeloma**, a cancer of antibody-secreting cells. Patients with multiple myeloma cannot produce healthy antibodies; instead they produce abnormal antibodies that are monoclonal proteins (M proteins). Thus, patients with multiple myeloma will present with elevated serum protein levels that show a distinct band in the gamma globulin region of a protein electrophoresis gel and a sharp spike (in M protein) on the densitometer scan rather than the normal broad smear (). When antibodies against the various types of antibody heavy and light chains are used to form precipitin arcs, the  **M protein** will cause distinctly skewed arcs against one class of heavy chain and one class of light chain as seen in {'Figure_20_2_IEP Figure 20.2.IEP}.
