name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Immunofluorescence** assays use antibody-fluorogen conjugates to illuminate antigens for easy, rapid detection.
  *  **Direct immunofluorescence** can be used to detect the presence of bacteria in clinical samples such as sputum.
  *  **Indirect immunofluorescence** detects the presence of antigen-specific antibodies in patient sera. The fluorescent antibody binds to the antigen-specific antibody rather than the antigen.
  * The use of indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect  **antinuclear antibodies** is an important tool in the diagnosis of several autoimmune diseases.
  *  **Flow cytometry** uses fluorescent mAbs against cell-membrane proteins to quantify specific subsets of cells in complex mixtures.
  *  **Fluorescence-activated cell sorters** are an extension of flow cytometry in which fluorescence intensity is used to physically separate cells into high and low fluorescence populations.
