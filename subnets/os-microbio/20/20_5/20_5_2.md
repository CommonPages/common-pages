name: Direct Fluorescent Antibody Techniques

 **Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests** use a fluorescently labeled mAb to bind and illuminate a target antigen. DFA tests are particularly useful for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial diseases. For example, fluorescence-labeled antibodies against  **Streptococcus pyogenes** ( **group A strep**) can be used to obtain a diagnosis of  **strep throat** from a throat swab. The diagnosis is ready in a matter of minutes, and the patient can be started on antibiotics before even leaving the clinic. DFA techniques may also be used to diagnose pneumonia caused by  **Mycoplasma pneumoniae** or  **Legionella pneumophila** from sputum samples ({'Figure_20_5_Legion Figure 20.5.Legion}). The fluorescent antibodies bind to the bacteria on a microscope slide, allowing ready detection of the bacteria using a  **fluorescence microscope**. Thus, the DFA technique is valuable for visualizing certain bacteria that are difficult to isolate or culture from patient samples.
