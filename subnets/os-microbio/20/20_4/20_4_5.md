name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Enzyme immunoassays (EIA)** are used to visualize and quantify antigens. They use an antibody conjugated to an enzyme to bind the antigen, and the enzyme converts a substrate into an observable end product. The substrate may be either a chromogen or a fluorogen.
  *  **Immunostaining** is an EIA technique for visualizing cells in a tissue ( **immunohistochemistry**) or examining intracellular structures ( **immunocytochemistry**).
  *  **Direct ELISA** is used to quantify an antigen in solution. The primary antibody captures the antigen, and the secondary antibody delivers an enzyme. Production of end product from the chromogenic substrate is directly proportional to the amount of captured antigen.
  *  **Indirect ELISA** is used to detect antibodies in patient serum by attaching antigen to the well of a microtiter plate, allowing the patient (primary) antibody to bind the antigen and an enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to detect the primary antibody.
  *  **Immunofiltration and immunochromatographic assays** are used in  **lateral flow tests**, which can be used to diagnose pregnancy and various diseases by detecting color-labeled antigen-antibody complexes in urine or other fluid samples
