name: Immunostaining

One powerful use of EIA is  **immunostaining**, in which antibody-enzyme conjugates enhance microscopy.  **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** is used for examining whole tissues. As seen in {'Figure_20_4_IHC Figure 20.4.IHC}, a section of tissue can be stained to visualize the various cell types. In this example, a mAb against CD8 was used to stain  **CD8** cells in a section of tonsil tissue. It is now possible to count the number of CD8 cells, determine their relative numbers versus the other cell types present, and determine the location of these cells within this tissue. Such data would be useful for studying diseases such as AIDS, in which the normal function of CD8 cells is crucial for slowing disease progression.

 **Immunocytochemistry (ICC)** is another valuable form of immunostaining. While similar to IHC, in ICC, extracellular matrix material is stripped away, and the cell membrane is etched with alcohol to make it permeable to antibodies. This allows antibodies to pass through the cell membrane and bind to specific targets inside the cell. Organelles, cytoskeletal components, and other intracellular structures can be visualized in this way. While some ICC techniques use EIA, the enzyme can be replaced with a fluorescent molecule, making it a fluorescent immunoassay.
