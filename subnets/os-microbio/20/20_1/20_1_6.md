name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Antibodies bind with high  **specificity** to antigens used to challenge the immune system, but they may also show  **cross-reactivity** by binding to other antigens that share chemical properties with the original antigen.
  * Injection of an antigen into an animal will result in a  **polyclonal antibody** response in which different antibodies are produced that react with the various epitopes on the antigen.
  *  **Polyclonal antisera** are useful for some types of laboratory assays, but other assays require more specificity. Diagnostic tests that use polyclonal antisera are typically only used for screening because of the possibility of  **false-positive** and  **false-negative** results.
  *  **Monoclonal antibodies** provide higher specificity than polyclonal antisera because they bind to a single epitope and usually have high  **affinity**.
  * Monoclonal antibodies are typically produced by culturing antibody-secreting  **hybridomas** derived from mice. mAbs are currently used to treat cancer, but their exorbitant cost has prevented them from being used more widely to treat infectious diseases. Still, their potential for laboratory and clinical use is driving the development of new, cost-effective solutions such as  **plantibodies**.
