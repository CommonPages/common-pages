name: Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Urogenital Tract - Introduction

The  **urinary system** filters blood, excretes wastes, and maintains an appropriate electrolyte and water balance. The  **reproductive system** is responsible for the production of gametes and participates in conception and, in females, development of offspring. Due to their proximity and overlap, these systems are often studied together and referred to as the  **urogenital system** (or genitourinary system).
