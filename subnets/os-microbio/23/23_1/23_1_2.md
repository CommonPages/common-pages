name: Anatomy of the Urinary Tract

The basic structures of the urinary tract are common in males and females. However, there are unique locations for these structures in females and males, and there is a significant amount of overlap between the urinary and genital structures in males. {'Figure_23_1_Urogenital Figure 23.1.Urogenital} illustrates the urinary anatomy common to females and males.

The  **kidneys** carry out the urinary systemâ€™s primary functions of filtering the blood and maintaining water and electrolyte balance. The kidneys are composed of millions of filtration units called nephrons. Each nephron is in intimate contact with blood through a specialized capillary bed called the  **glomerulus** (plural  *glomeruli*). Fluids, electrolytes, and molecules from the blood pass from the glomerulus into the nephron, creating the filtrate that becomes urine ({'Figure_23_1_Nephron Figure 23.1.Nephron}). Urine that collects in each kidney empties through a  **ureter** and drains to the  **urinary bladder**, which stores urine. Urine is released from the bladder to the  **urethra**, which transports it to be excreted from the body through the  **urinary meatus**, the opening of the urethra.
