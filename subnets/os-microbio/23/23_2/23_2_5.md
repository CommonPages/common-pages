name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Bacterial  **cystitis** is commonly caused by fecal bacteria such as  *E. coli.*
  * Pyelonephritis is a serious kidney infection that is often caused by bacteria that travel from infections elsewhere in the urinary tract and may cause systemic complications.
  *  **Leptospirosis** is a bacterial infection of the kidney that can be transmitted by exposure to infected animal urine, especially in contaminated water. It is more common in tropical than in temperate climates.
  *  **Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU)** is commonly caused by  *C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum,* and  *M. hominis.*
  * Diagnosis and treatment for bacterial urinary tract infections varies. Urinalysis (e.g., for leukocyte esterase levels, nitrite levels, microscopic evaluation, and culture of urine) is an important component in most cases. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically used.
