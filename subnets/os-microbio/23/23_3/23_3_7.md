name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Bacterial vaginosis** is caused by an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota, with a decrease in lactobacilli and an increase in vaginal pH.  *G. vaginalis* is the most common cause of bacterial vaginosis, which is associated with vaginal discharge, odor, burning, and itching.
  *  **Gonorrhea** is caused by  *N. gonorrhoeae*, which can cause infection of the reproductive and urinary tracts and is associated with symptoms of urethritis. If left untreated, it can progress to epididymitis, salpingitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease and enter the bloodstream to infect other sites in the body.
  *  **Chlamydia** is the most commonly reported STI and is caused by  *C. trachomatis*. Most infections are asymptomatic, and infections that are not treated can spread to involve the epididymis of men and cause salpingitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women.
  *  **Syphilis** is caused by  *T. pallidum* and has three stages, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary syphilis is associated with a painless hard chancre lesion on genitalia. Secondary syphilis is associated with skin and mucous membrane lesions. Tertiary syphilis is the most serious and life-threatening, and can involve serious nervous system damage.
  *  **Chancroid** is an infection of the reproductive tract caused by  *H. ducreyi* that results in the development of characteristic  **soft chancres**.
