name: B Cell Production and Maturation

Like T cells, B cells are formed from multipotent  **hematopoietic stem cells** (HSCs) in the bone marrow and follow a pathway through lymphoid stem cell and lymphoblast (see {'Figure_17_5_Hematopo Figure 17.5.Hematopo}). Unlike T cells, however, lymphoblasts destined to become B cells do not leave the  **bone marrow** and travel to the thymus for maturation. Rather, eventual B cells continue to mature in the bone marrow.

The first step of B cell maturation is an assessment of the functionality of their antigen-binding receptors. This occurs through  **positive selection** for B cells with normal functional receptors. A mechanism of  **negative selection** is then used to eliminate  **self-reacting B cells** and minimize the risk of  **autoimmunity**. Negative selection of self-reacting B cells can involve elimination by  **apoptosis**, editing or modification of the receptors so they are no longer self-reactive, or induction of  **anergy** in the B cell. Immature B cells that pass the selection in the bone marrow then travel to the  **spleen** for their final stages of maturation. There they become  **na√Øve mature B cells**, i.e., mature B cells that have not yet been activated.
