name: Superantigens and Unregulated Activation of T Cells

When T cell activation is controlled and regulated, the result is a protective response that is effective in combating infections. However, if T cell activation is unregulated and excessive, the result can be a life-threatening. Certain bacterial and viral pathogens produce toxins known as  **superantigens** (see <link:>) that can trigger such an unregulated response. Known bacterial superantigens include  **toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)**,  **staphylococcal enterotoxins**,  **streptococcal pyrogenic toxins**,  **streptococcal superantigen**, and the  **streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin**. Viruses known to produce superantigens include  **Epstein-Barr virus** (human herpesvirus 4),  **cytomegalovirus** (human herpesvirus 5), and others.

The mechanism of T cell activation by superantigens involves their simultaneous binding to  **MHC II** molecules of APCs and the variable region of the  **TCR** Î² chain. This binding occurs outside of the antigen-binding cleft of MHC II, so the superantigen will bridge together and activate MHC II and TCR without specific foreign epitope recognition ({'Figure_18_3_SuperAntig Figure 18.3.SuperAntig}). The result is an excessive, uncontrolled release of cytokines, often called a  **cytokine storm**, which stimulates an excessive inflammatory response. This can lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, shock, multi-organ failure, and potentially, death.
