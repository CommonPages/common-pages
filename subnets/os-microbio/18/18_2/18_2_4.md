name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)** is a collection of genes coding for glycoprotein molecules expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells.
  *  **MHC I** molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and are essential for presentation of normal “self” antigens. Cells that become infected by intracellular pathogens can present foreign antigens on MHC I as well, marking the infected cell for destruction.
  *  **MHC II** molecules are expressed only on the surface of  **antigen-presenting cells** (macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells). Antigen presentation with MHC II is essential for the activation of T cells.
  *  **Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)** primarily ingest pathogens by phagocytosis, destroy them in the phagolysosomes, process the protein antigens, and select the most antigenic/immunodominant epitopes with MHC II for presentation to T cells.
  *  **Cross-presentation** is a mechanism of antigen presentation and T-cell activation used by dendritic cells not directly infected by the pathogen; it involves phagocytosis of the pathogen but presentation on MHC I rather than MHC II.
