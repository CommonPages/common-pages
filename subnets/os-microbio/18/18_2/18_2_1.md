name: Major Histocompatibility Complexes and Antigen-Presenting Cells - Introduction

As discussed in <link:>,  **major histocompatibility complex (MHC)** molecules are expressed on the surface of healthy cells, identifying them as normal and “self” to  **natural killer (NK) cells**. MHC molecules also play an important role in the presentation of foreign antigens, which is a critical step in the activation of T cells and thus an important mechanism of the adaptive immune system.
