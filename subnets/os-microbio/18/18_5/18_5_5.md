name: Key Concepts and Summary

  * Adaptive immunity can be divided into four distinct classifications:  **natural active immunity, natural passive immunity, artificial passive immunity,** and  **artificial active immunity.**
  * Artificial active immunity is the foundation for  **vaccination** and vaccine development. Vaccination programs not only confer artificial immunity on individuals, but also foster  **herd immunity** in populations.
  *  **Variolation** against smallpox originated in the 10<sup>th</sup> century in China, but the procedure was risky because it could cause the disease it was intended to prevent. Modern vaccination was developed by Edward Jenner, who developed the practice of inoculating patients with infectious materials from cowpox lesions to prevent smallpox.
  *  **Live attenuated vaccines** and  **inactivated vaccines** contain whole pathogens that are weak, killed, or inactivated.  **Subunit vaccines, toxoid vaccines,** and  **conjugate vaccines** contain acellular components with antigens that stimulate an immune response.
