    For many diseases, prevention is the best form of treatment, and few strategies for disease prevention are as effective as vaccination. Vaccination is a form of artificial immunity. By artificially stimulating the adaptive immune defenses, a vaccine triggers  **memory cell production** similar to that which would occur during a  **primary response**. In so doing, the patient is able to mount a strong secondary response upon exposure to the pathogenâ€”but without having to first suffer through an initial infection. In this section, we will explore several different kinds of artificial immunity along with various types of vaccines and the mechanisms by which they induce artificial immunity.
