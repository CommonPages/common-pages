name: Key Concepts and Summary

  *  **Adaptive immunity** is an acquired defense against foreign pathogens that is characterized by  **specificity** and  **memory.** The first exposure to an antigen stimulates a  **primary response**, and subsequent exposures stimulate a faster and strong  **secondary response.**
  * Adaptive immunity is a dual system involving  **humoral immunity** (antibodies produced by B cells) and  **cellular immunity** (T cells directed against intracellular pathogens).
  *  **Antigens**, also called  **immunogens**, are molecules that activate adaptive immunity. A single antigen possesses smaller  **epitopes**, each capable of inducing a specific adaptive immune response.
  * An antigenâ€™s ability to stimulate an immune response depends on several factors, including its molecular class, molecular complexity, and size.
  *  **Antibodies** ( **immunoglobulins**) are Y-shaped glycoproteins with two Fab sites for binding antigens and an Fc portion involved in complement activation and opsonization.
  * The five classes of antibody are  **IgM**,  **IgG**,  **IgA**,  **IgE**, and  **IgD**, each differing in size, arrangement, location within the body, and function. The five primary functions of antibodies are neutralization, opsonization, agglutination, complement activation, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
