name: Abnormal Clinical Findings (Tumor Markers, Imaging, etc.)

These are abnormal tumor markers and/or clinical findings closely related to neoplasm. Just because these tumor markers are high, or the imaging is questionable, that doesnâ€™t mean there is a neoplasm. Usually patients with these types of codes will have further workup.
