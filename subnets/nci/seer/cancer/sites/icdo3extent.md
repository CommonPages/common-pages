## Definitions
### Key words/possible involvement:
Terms which indicate possible involvement by tumor. Common terms are provided, but the list is not all-inclusive.

### Other words/no involvement:
Other terms seen in reports which indicate an abnormality but do not indicate a neoplastic process. Common terms are provided, but the list is not all-inclusive.

### Key Information
Information to look for in the report of the study. Key information helps define the extent of disease.

## Diagnostic Studies
- Physical Exam
- Imaging
- Tumor Markers
- Endoscopies
- Pathology

## Physical Exam
Key Information
Location of any masses or enlarged organs (organomegaly; hepatomegaly; splenomegaly); palpable lymph nodes, especially supraclavicular; jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes due to blockage of bile ducts by metastases).

Go to the Physical Exam page of the Diagnostic Tests for more information.

## Imaging
Key Information
Size and location of primary tumor; relationship of mass to other tissues, such as impingement or extension to another tissue (ribs, chest wall, pleura); elevation of diaphragm on one side (phrenic nerve paralysis); hilar or mediastinal involvement; enlargement or decrease in size of lung(s); opacity, such as atelectasis, pleural effusion or pneumonitis; masses in mediastinum and/or hilum of lung; involvement of distant sites.

## Tumor Markers
### Key Information
Baseline and observationâ€”to assess tumor burden and monitor for recurrence.

### NSE (Neuron Specific Enolase)
Elevated level indicates presence of small cell carcinoma of lung and neuroblastoma.

### Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Antigen
Monitors tumor burden after treatment for squamous cell carcinoma; usually used for advanced disease; primary application is head and neck cancer, secondarily for lung cancer.

### DNA Studies
Differentiates between tumors at high and low risk for recurrence. DNA studies are a prognostic tool for non-small cell lung and other solid tumors.

### Ploidy Analysis
Aneuploid tumors correlate with more aggressive behavior and a greater risk of recurrence.

### S-Phase Analysis
Patients with high S-phase fraction have less favorable prognosis.

## Other Tumor Markers
### ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)
Elevated level found in paraneoplastic syndrome caused by small cell carcinoma. Non-diagnostic of lung cancer, but an indicator of metastases.

### CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)
Persistent elevated levels indicate residual or recurrent metastatic carcinoma; smoking may affect accuracy of CEA results.

### Calcitonin
Elevated levels of this thyroid hormone occasionally occur with small cell lung cancer; increasing levels may indicate progression of disease.

### TPA (Tissue Polypeptide Antigen)
Elevated level indicates presence of malignancy; not specific to lung cancer, also monitors bladder, prostate, and gynecologic tumors.

Go to the Tumor Markers page of the Diagnostic Tests module for more information.


## Endoscopies
Bronchoscopy
Mediastinoscopy
Thoracoscopy
Laryngoscopy
Esophagoscopy
Go to the Endoscopies page of the Diagnostic Tests module for more information.

## Pathology
Key Information
Cell type and grade, location within specimen, exact size of lesion, distance from carina, presence of other tumors in specimen, location, size and number of lymph nodes involved (ipsilateral or contralateral), invasion of blood vessels and/or lymphatic channels within specimen, extension to adjacent tissues (mainstem bronchus, pleura, pericardium, muscle, ribs), results of biopsies of possible metastatic sites.

Bone Marrow Biopsy
Cytology
Closed Chest Needle Biopsy
Sputum Cytology
Bronchial Washings
Thoracentesis
Go to the Pathology page of the Diagnostic Tests module for more information.
