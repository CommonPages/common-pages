Prior to the Second Edition of ICD-O, trachea and lung had the same ICD-O code. With the advent of ICD-O-2, trachea has a separate code (C33.9) from lung (C34.\_).

The ICD-O four-digit sub sites of C33.9 through C34.9 are considered part of a single primary site. Since lung is a paired organ, laterality must be coded.
