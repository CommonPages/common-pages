    / Cancer: A Historic Perspective
    let full >
      Since the earliest medical records were kept, cancer as a disease has been described in the history of medicine. The earliest known descriptions of cancer appear in seven papyri, discovered and deciphered late in the 19th century. They provided the first direct knowledge of Egyptian medical practice. Two of them, known as the "Edwin Smith" and "George Ebers" papyri, contain descriptions of cancer written around 1600 B.C., and are believed to date from sources as early as 2500 B.C. The Smith papyrus describes surgery, while the Ebers' papyrus outlines pharmacological, mechanical, and magical treatments.

      Based on the information recorded on papyri and hieroglyphic inscriptions, ancient Egyptians were able to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors. They were also able to use different treatments, including surgery, and other various modes of medicine.

      Following the decline of Egypt, the next chapters of medical and scientific history were written in Greece and Rome. The great doctors Hippocrates and Galen dominated medical thought for 1500 years. They lifted medicine out of the realms of magic, superstition, and religion. Hippocrates and Galen defined disease as a natural process, and based treatment on observation and experience. Cancers were identified, with warnings against treatment of the more severe forms. Hippocrates is credited with naming "cancer" as "karkinoma" (carcinoma) because a tumor looked like a "crab" ("karkinoma" is Greek for "crab") in that there is a central body to a tumor and the tumor extension appeared as the legs of the "crab".

      After the fall of Rome, Constantinople became the intellectual storehouse of civilization. From there, in Arabic translations, classic Greek and Roman texts made their way back through Europe. The ancient teachings of Galen continued to inspire physicians in Constantinople, Cairo, Alexandria, Athens, and Antioch in a time when magic spells and myths dominated the West. Cancer continued to be explained as the result of an excess of black bile, curable only in its earliest stages.

      In the modern world, science and surgery advanced as physicians returned to direct observation of the human body. However, the theory that cancer was caused by an excess of black bile continued to prevail in the 16th century. Cancer was considered incurable, although a wide variety of pastes containing arsenic were formulated to treat its manifestations. In the 17th century, the old theory of disease based on bodily humors was discarded when Gaspare Aselli discovered the vessels of the lymphatic system and suggested abnormalities of lymph as the primary cause of cancer.

      Rejecting the 17th-century theory about the cause of cancer was the French physician Claude Gendron. He concluded that cancer arises locally as a hard, growing mass, untreatable with drugs, and must be removed with all its "filaments."

      Two 18th-century French scientists, physician Jean Astruc and chemist Bernard Peyrilhe, conducted experiments to confirm or disprove hypotheses related to cancer. Their efforts, however absurd they seem in retrospect, established experimental oncology, the science of seeking better diagnosis, treatments and understanding of the causes of cancer. During this period, environmental cancers were reported, and hospitals specializing in cancer care were opened.

      In the late 19th century, the development of better microscopes not only helped document and define disease-causing organisms, but also made possible the examination of cells and cellular activity. Study of cancer tissues and tumors revealed that cancercells were markedly different in appearance than normal cells of surrounding tissue or the cells from which they originated. Researchers began to focus on questions such as the origin of cells and the relationship of disease to the behavior of a cell. It was the invention of the microscope that revealed the cancer cell itself.

      The early 20th century saw great strides made in understanding the structures, functions and chemistry of living organisms. Cancer research in cell culture, chemical carcinogens, diagnostic techniques and chemotherapy firmly established oncology as science. Researchers pursued different theories of the origin of cancer, subjecting their hypotheses to systematic experimentation. A viral cause of cancer in chickens was documented in 1911, and both chemical and physical carcinogens were conclusively identified. Chromosomal abnormalities were also investigated as possible causes of cancer.

      In 1913, a need to combat rising public fear and ignorance concerning cancer led to two significant events: the publication of the first known article on cancer's warning signs in a popular woman's magazine, and formation of a nationwide organization dedicated to public education on cancer. Cancer, as a disease, was brought into the light of day.

      In 1937, the U.S. Congress made the conquest of cancer a national goal with a unanimous vote to pass the National Cancer Institute Act. This Act created the National Cancer Institute, which was expected to break new theoretical ground by conducting its own research, promoting research in other institutions and coordinating cancer-related projects and activities. In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, launching a National Cancer Program administered by the National Cancer Institute. Key events in the United States' national cancer policy legislative history, from 1937 to 1999 are available here.

      Since its establishment, fundamental biomedical research supported by the National Cancer Institute has advanced the understanding of cancer. Using tools of molecular biology and molecular genetics, scientists are making great leaps in the discovery and mapping of links between chromosomes, the genes within, and cancer. In addition to traditional cancer therapies, potential solutions to the prevention and cure of cancer seem limited only by the imagination.

      Here is what we have learned from Cancer: A Historic Perspective:

      Ancient Egyptians first recorded cancer as a disease. From papyrus manuscripts and hieroglyphic inscriptions we learned that some 4500 years ago, attempts were already made by Egyptians to understand cancer and to treat the cancer patients, using surgery and magical treatments.
      In Greece and Rome, and throughout the Middle Ages, cancer was continuously regarded as a disease caused by an excess of black bile. While surgeries were carried out to treat cancer, doctors believed that the disease was curable only in its earliest stages and best left alone.
      In the 16th century, the theory that cancer was caused by an excess of black bile continued to prevail.
      During the 17th century, the old theory of disease based on bodily humors was discarded when Gaspare Aselli discovered the vessels of the lymphatic system and suggested abnormalities of lymph as the primary cause of cancer.
      Observations on environmental cancers were made in the 18th century. People started research on the connection between certain environments and cancer incidence patterns. With the first systematic experiments in cancer, oncology was born as a medical discipline.
      In the late 19th century, study of cancer tissues and tumors revealed that cancer cells were markedly different in appearance than normal cells of surrounding tissue.
      In the early 20th century, cancer research in cell culture, chemical carcinogens, diagnostic techniques and chemotherapy firmly established oncology as an experimental science.
      In 1937, the U.S. Congress passed the National Cancer Institute Act with a unanimous vote, creating the National Cancer Institute.
      In 1971, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, launching a National Cancer Program administered by the National Cancer Institute.

    / Review: What Is Cancer?
    let review >
      Here is what we have learned from What Is Cancer?:

        - The American Cancer Society defines cancer as "a group of diseases characterized by uncontrollable growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death."
        - Cancer does not refer to a single disease. Rather, it consists of more than 100 different diseases.
        - A few cancer-related terms are introduced: cancer, neoplasia, tumor, neoplasm, and growth. Neoplasia, a synonym of cancer, is often used by medical professionals. Neoplasm is a synonym for tumor, which literally means "new growth." Several other terms referring to abnormal cell growth which are not cancer include: hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia.
        - Cell biology of cancer defines the differences between normal cells and cancer cells. Normal, healthy cells carry out specific functions of the body and the cells' growth is controlled by a complicated biochemical mechanism of the body. Cancer cells grow in an uncontrollable manner and are unable to recognize their own natural boundaries due to faulty gene mutations in the cancer cells.
        - Although scientists have not yet pinpointed an exact cause for cancer, many factors have been identified that are likely to cause development of cancer in the body. These factors are called "cancer risk factors" and include smoking, diet, genetics, occupation, environment, and infectious agents.

    / What Is Cancer?
    let characteristics >
      There are many texts and references that attempt to define cancer. The simplest definition is from the American Cancer SocietyExternal Website Policy (ACS). According to the ACS, cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death.

      ## Characteristics of Cancer
      ### Abnormality
      Cells are the structural units of all living things. Each of us has trillions of cells, as does a growing tree. Cells make it possible for us to carry out all kinds of functions of life: the beating of the heart, breathing, digesting food, thinking, walking, and so on. However, all of these functions can only be carried out by normal healthy cells. Some cells stop functioning or behaving as they should, serving no useful purpose in the body at all, and become cancerous cells.

      ### Uncontrollability
      The most fundamental characteristic of cells is their ability to reproduce themselves. They do this simply by dividing: one cell becomes two, the two become four, and so on. The division of normal and healthy cells occurs in a regulated and systematic fashion. In most parts of the body, the cells continually divide and form new cells to supply the material for growth or to replace worn-out or injured cells. For example, when you cut your finger, certain cells divide rapidly until the tissue is healed and the skin is repaired. They will then go back to their normal rate of division. In contrast, cancer cells divide in a haphazard manner. The result is that they typically pile up into a non-structured mass or tumor.

      ### Invasiveness
      {image-right:'InvasiveCancer}
      Sometimes tumors do not stay harmlessly in one place. They destroy the part of the body in which they originate and then spread to other parts where they start new growth and cause more destruction. This characteristic distinguishes cancer from benign growths, which remain in the part of the body in which they start. Although benign tumors may grow quite large and press on neighboring structures, they do not spread to other parts of the body. Frequently, they are completely enclosed in a protective capsule of tissue and they typically do not pose danger to human life like malignant tumors (cancer) do.

      ## A Group of Diseases
      Although cancer is often referred to as a single condition, it actually consists of more than 100 different diseases. These diseases are characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer can arise in many sites and behave differently depending on its organ of origin. Breast cancer, for example, has different characteristics than those of lung cancer. It is important to understand that cancer originating in one body organ takes its characteristics with it even if it spreads to another part of the body. For example, metastatic breast cancer in the lungs continues to behave like breast cancer when viewed under a microscope, and it continues to look like a cancer that originated in the breast.

    / Cancer Terms
    let terms >
      # Cancer Terms
      ## Cancer, Neoplasia, Tumor, Neoplasm
      The word cancer comes from the Latin (originally Greek) derived term for crab, because of the way a cancer adheres to any part that it seizes upon in an obstinate manner like the crab. Hippocrates first described cancer as having a central body with the tendency to reach out and spread like "the arms of a crab." Besides the popular, generic term "cancer" used by most people, there is another more technical term: neoplasia. Neoplasia (neo = new, plasia = tissue or cells) or neoplasm literally means new tissue in Greek. This indicates that cancers are actually new growths of cells in the body.

      Another term for cancer is "malignant tumor." Tumor literally means "swelling" or "mass." In this case, it refers to a mass of non-structured new cells, which have no known purpose in the physiological function of the body.

      There are two general types of tumors: benign (non-cancerous) tumors and malignant (cancerous) tumors. A benign tumor is composed of cells that will not invade other unrelated tissues or organs of the body, although it may continue to grow in size abnormally. A malignant tumor is composed of cells that invade the [glossary term:] basement membrane and invade or spread to other parts of the body. This occurs either by direct extension to neighboring organs and/or tissues or by metastasizing to distant sites by means of the vascular system (the blood stream), the lymphatic system, or by seeding or implantation of cancer cells in body cavities.

      Terms such as "mass" and "lump" are used to describe any overgrowth of tissue. However, these terms may not necessarily mean that such growths contain cancer cells.

      ## Types of Abnormal Cell Growth
      In addition to neoplasia, there are several other terms referring to abnormal cell growth. These include the following:

      Hyperplasia refers to an abnormal increase in the number of cells, which are in a normal component of that tissue and are arranged in a normal fashion with subsequent enlargement of the affected part. One example is thyroid hyperplasia, an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by an abnormal rapid growth of the epithelial cells lining the follicles. Another example is: Guitar strumming leads to hyperplasia of the cells on the thumb (a callus is formed). The callus on the thumb is a hyperplastic growth.

      Hypertrophy refers to an abnormal increase in the size of each cell, for example, the increase in cell size of cardiac muscle.

      Metaplasia refers to the replacement of one mature cell type with another mature cell type: for example, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory columnar epithelium — as evidenced by the metaplastic cough of a smoker.

      Dysplasia refers to the replacement of one mature cell type with a less mature cell type: for example, dysplasia of the cervix epithelium.

      Hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia are reversible because they are results of a stimulus. Neoplasia is irreversible because it is autonomous.

      ## Tumor Terminology Generalizations
      Names of benign tumors usually end with "oma" regardless of their cell type. For example, a benign glandular tumor (epithelium tissue) is called adenoma and a benign bone tumor is called osteoma, while a malignant glandular tumor is called adenocarcinoma and a malignant bone tumor is called osteosarcoma.

      In addition to benign tumors, there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors. In situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane, whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane.

    / Cell Biology of Cancer

      # Cell Biology of Cancer
      The cell is the fundamental unit of life. It is the smallest structure of the body capable of performing all of the processes that define life. Each of the organs in the body, such as the lung, breast, colon, and brain, consists of specialized cells that carry out the organ's functions such as the transportation of oxygen, digestion of nutrients, excretion of waste materials, locomotion, reproduction, thinking, etc.

      To assure the proper performance of each organ, worn out or injured cells must be replaced, and particular types of cells must increase in response to environmental changes. For example, the bone marrow increases its production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells sevenfold or greater in response to bleeding or high altitude. Certain white blood cells are produced more rapidly during an infection. Similarly, the liver or endocrine organs frequently respond to injury by regenerating damaged cells.

      As stated in the previous section, reproduction of cells is a process of cell division. The division of normal cells is a highly regulated process. The cell growth, inheritance and containment is controlled by its DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

      DNA is a highly complex molecule manufactured in the cell nucleus and serves as the cell's "brain." DNA is the blueprint for everything the cell does. In a human cell, the DNA is arranged in 46 distinct sections called chromosomes. They are arranged in pairs, 23 chromosomes from each biological parent.

      Together, the 46 chromosomes contain more than 100,000 genes. A gene is a segment of DNA that determines the structure of a protein, which is needed for development and growth as well as carrying out vital chemical functions in the body. Like the chromosomes, genes are arranged in pairs — one gene from the mother and one from the father.

      Each gene occupies a specific location on a chromosome. Through a number of biochemical steps, each gene tells a cell to make a different protein. Some genes instruct the cell to manufacture structural proteins, which serve as building blocks. Other genes tell the cell to produce hormones, growth factors or cytokines, which exit the cell and communicate with other cells. Still other genes tell the cell to produce regulatory proteins that control the function of other proteins or tell other genes when to turn "on" or "off." When a gene is turned on, it manufactures another complex molecule called ribonucleic acid (RNA), which contains all the information the cell needs to make new proteins.

      Cells divide only when they receive the proper signals from growth factors that circulate in the bloodstream or from a cell they directly contact. For example, if a person loses blood, a growth factor called erythropoietin, which is produced in the kidneys, circulates in the bloodstream and tells the bone marrow to manufacture more blood cells.

      When a cell receives the message to divide, it goes through the cell cycle, which includes several phases for the division to be completed. Checkpoints along each step of the process make sure that everything goes the way it should.

      Many processes are involved in cell reproduction and all these processes have to take place correctly for a cell to divide properly. If anything goes wrong during this complicated process, a cell may become cancerous.

      A cancer cell is a cell that grows out of control. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells ignore signals to stop dividing, to specialize, or to die and be shed. Growing in an uncontrollable manner and unable to recognize its own natural boundary, the cancer cells may spread to areas of the body where they do not belong.

      In a cancer cell, several genes change (mutate) and the cell becomes defective. There are two general types of gene mutations. One type, dominant mutation, is caused by an abnormality in one gene in a pair. An example is a mutated gene that produces a defective protein that causes the growth-factor receptor on a cell's surface to be constantly "on" when, in fact, no growth factor is present. The result is that the cell receives a constant message to divide. This dominant "gain of function gene" is often called an oncogene (onco = cancer).

      The second general type of mutation, recessive mutation, is characterized by both genes in the pair being damaged. For example, a normal gene called p53 produces a protein that turns "off" the cell cycle and thus helps to control cell growth. The primary function of the p53 gene is to repair or destroy defective cells, thereby controlling potential cancerous cells. This type of gene is called an anti-oncogene or tumor suppressor gene. If only one p53 gene in the pair is mutated, the other gene will still be able to control the cell cycle. However, if both genes are mutated, the "off" switch is lost, and the cell division is no longer under control.

      Abnormal cell division can occur either when active oncogenes are expressed or when tumor suppressor genes are lost. In fact, for a cell to become malignant, numerous mutations are necessary. In some cases, both types of mutations — dominant and recessive — may occur.

      A gene mutation may allow an already abnormal cell to invade the normal tissue where the cancer started or to travel in the bloodstream (metastasize) to remote parts of the body, where it continues to divide.

      A normal cell can become damaged in different ways. A cell can become abnormal when part of a gene is lost (deleted), when part of a chromosome is rearranged and ends up in the wrong place (translocation), or when an extremely small defect occurs in the DNA, which results in an abnormal DNA "blueprint" and production of a defective protein occurs.

      Abnormal cell division can also be caused by viruses. In this case, genes may be normal, but the protein may not function normally because the cell contains a cancer-producing virus.

      How a specific cancer cell behaves depends on which processes are not functioning properly. Some cancer cells simply divide and produce more cancer cells, and the tumor mass stays where it began. Other cancer cells are able to invade normal tissue, enter the bloodstream, and metastasize to a remote site in the body.

      In summary, cancer cells have defects in normal cellular functions that allow them to divide, invade the surrounding tissue, and spread by way of vascular and/or lymphatic systems. These defects are the result of gene mutations sometimes caused by infectious viruses.

    / Cell Cycle
    let cellcycle >
      Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce (mitosis). The cell cycle is a series of changes the cell goes through from the time it is first formed until it divides into two daughter cells. It starts at mitosis (M-phase) and ends with mitosis. In between are the G-1, S, and G-2 phases. The duration of S, M and G-2 are relatively constant in different tissues.

      Between the M-phase and the S-phase is a gap (G-l) where production of RNA, proteins, and enzymes needed for DNA synthesis occurs. The duration of G-1 varies and determines the length of the cell cycle.

      The S-phase is when DNA synthesis occurs.

      Between the S-phase and M-phase is a second gap (G-2). Cells are thought to prepare for mitosis in G-2 when specialized proteins and RNA are produced. G-0 is a dormant phase.

      The four phases of mitosis are:

      1. Prophase
        a. Centrosomes separate and migrate to opposite poles.
        b. Centrioles separate.
        c. Chromatin is transformed into chromosomes composed of pairs of filaments called chromatids (each is a complete genetic copy of its chromosome).
        d. The nuclear membrane disappears.
      2. Metaphase
        a. Paired chromosomes become lined up between the centrioles.
      3. Anaphase
        a. Chromatids are pulled toward the centrioles. One chromatid from each pair goes to each daughter cell.
      4. Telophase (divided into parts I and II)
        a. Telophase I
          i. Chromosomes become more polarized and transformed into thread-like structures.
          ii. A nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes forming a new nucleus with a nucleolus.
          iii. The centrioles duplicate.
        b. Telophase II
          i. Actual dividing of the cell occurs (cytokinesis).
          ii. Cytoplasm splits and two daughter cells are formed.

    / Cancer Risk Factors
    let riskfactors >
      # Cancer Risk Factors
      The search for cause(s) of cancer has been going on for centuries. Early researchers said that cancer was a natural result of aging. As cells degenerated, it was believed that some simply became malignant. Others said cancer was hereditary, and investigations into genetics began. Then some began to consider chemical links while still others questioned whether viruses or bacteria were at fault. Finally, the "irritation" theory became popular,and researchers began trying to identify irritants — such as tobacco and coal tar — that would cause cancer in laboratory animals. Ultimately, though, cancer experts were forced to confront the fact that although all these factors might be involved, none of them invariably cause cancer. Not every animal or person exposed to an irritant or a particular chemical in the laboratory developed cancer, nor did all elderly people or everyone with a family history of cancer get it. As a result, scientists had to abandon the theory that cancer had a single cause.

      However, despite the fact that there is yet no absolute agreement among the cancer research community in terms of what actually causes cancer, scientists are certain that many factors can be linked to cancer. These factors, including many other possible causes of cancer suggested by cancer researchers, are believed to be "cancer risk factors." These risk factors include eating habits, lifestyle, living or working environments, genetics, and many others. Following are some major cancer risk factors identified by researchers with the support of scientific statistics:

        - Smoking
        - Diet
        - Genetics
        - Occupation and Environment
        - Infectious Agents
        - Smoking

      Cigarette smoking alone is directly related to at least one-third of all cancer deaths annually in the United States. Cigarette smoking is the most significant cause of lung cancer and the leading cause of lung cancer death in both men and women. Smoking is also responsible for most cancers of the larynx, oral cavity, and esophagus. In addition, it is highly associated with the development of, and deaths from, bladder, kidney, pancreatic, and cervical cancers. Tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemical agents, including 60 substances that are known to cause cancer ([glossary term:] carcinogens).

      The health risks with cigarette smoking are not limited to smokers. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke significantly increases a nonsmoker's risk of developing lung cancer. Environmental tobacco smoke is the smoke that nonsmokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking.

      ## Diet
      The lifestyle factor that has received the most attention in recent years is diet. Evidence suggests that about one-third of the cancer deaths each year that occur in the United States are related to dietary factors. These include types of food, preparation methods, portion size, variety, and overall caloric balance.

      A high-fat diet has been associated with an increased risk for cancer of the prostate, endometrium, and colon and rectum. It is believed that a high-fat diet is a cancer promoter, with numerous theories to explain the effects of excess fat. For instance, excess fat seems to be involved in the production of [glossary term:] free radicals, which play a role in many types of cancer. A high-fat diet also increases the flow of bile acids into the intestine, which can promote colon cancer.

      Study results suggest that certain food additives, as well as preparation methods, can either cause or promote cancer. Even some so-called natural methods of preserving foods are not considered safe. For example, pickled, cured, and smoked products appear to promote stomach cancer, possibly due to nitrites used in curing as well as to other compounds produced during smoking and pickling. The decrease in gastric cancer incidence is largely due to modern refrigeration and a reduction in pickled, cured, and smoked food products.

      ## Genetics
      By definition, cancer is really a disease of genes. Genes are very small molecules in our cells, which determine almost everything in our body. Genes that control the genetics and heredity of each cell are strung like beads on a necklace along the cell's DNA in the cell nucleus. In a benign or malignant tumor, several of the genes regulating these processes are abnormal (mutated). Abnormal genes may be inherited or damaged by carcinogens, viruses, errors in cell division, and as yet unknown factors.

      A number of the most common cancers, including breast, colon, ovarian, and uterine cancer, recur generation after generation in some families. In addition, certain genetic factors may predispose those affected to specific cancers. A few rare cancers, such as the eye cancer, retinoblastoma, and a type of colon cancer, have been linked to specific genes that can be tracked within a family.

      Although it is helpful to know the role that our genetic heritage may play as a possible cause of cancer, scientists believe that environmental influences and our behaviors may outweigh the risks inherent in our family tree.

      ## Occupation and Environment
      Scientists have long been aware of the linkage between one's health conditions and one's occupation and environment.

      People who have direct contact to carcinogenic agents in the workplace are at the highest risk for developing cancer. For example, a recent study suggests that people with brain cancer are more likely to have worked in certain occupations than similarly aged people without brain cancer. Many cancer-causing chemicals have been identified and many of them are banned from manufacture in the United States.

      More recently, investigators have identified a link between the environment and skin cancer. The environmental factor is something we depend on for our life: sunlight. Scientists have found that ultraviolet light causes mutations of genes, producing a carcinogenic effect. Now, we not only know that tumors may appear years after the damaging effects of sunlight, but also the risks from exposure to ultraviolet light are greater for light-skinned people. Statistics show that in the U.S. alone about a million new cases of skin cancer ([glossary term:] basal and squamous cell carcinomas) occur annually, rivaling the incidence of all other types of cancer combined.

      The common body surfaces that are exposed to carcinogens are the skin, nasal passages, and lung. The primary internal body surface that has contact with carcinogens is the urinary bladder.

      ## Infectious Agents
      Because viruses can invade and alter cells' genetic material, viral infections are implicated in some cancers. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, a tumor found mainly among children in Africa. The hepatitis B virus is responsible for much of the liver cancer around the world. The highest rates of hepatitis B infection in the world is in China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand with equally high rates of liver cancer in these countries. The human papilloma virus that causes genital warts has been shown to play an important causative role in cervical cancer. The human T-cell leukemia virus, a close relative of the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is associated with a cancer known as Kaposisarcoma and some types of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

      Cancer risk factors are not limited to those listed above. There are still other risk factors such as ethanol use, use of certain medications, hormones, and reproductive and sexual behavior. With further scientific research, more cancer risk factors will be identified in the future.

      In summary, cancer is caused by both external (chemical, radiation, and viruses) and internal (hormones, immune conditions, and inherited mutations) factors. Causal factors may act together, or in sequence, to initiate or promote carcinogenesis.

      Cancers are named according to the organ in which they originate. Even if a cancer metastasizes to another part of the body, it keeps its original name. Cancer names such as breast cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer are examples. However, cancer names may also be based on the type of tissue affected. This section will introduce you to some basics regarding the derivation of tissues in the context of embryology, which is the study of the development of an organism.

    / Derivation of Cells
    let derivecell >
      Human beings begin life as a single, newly fertilized cell. Like every cell that contains a nucleus, the fertilized cell holds all the instructions for its growth and development. The characteristics common to all living cells include the ability to reproduce, exchange gases, move, react to external stimuli, and create or utilize energy to perform their tasks.

      Shortly after the ovum or egg is fertilized, it divides to form two cells. These two cells then divide to form a total of four, which again divide to form eight and continues on. This group of cells continues dividing; after nine days it attaches to the wall of the uterus and becomes an [glossary term:] embryo.

      About two weeks after conception, the cells of the embryo continue to divide, changing their shape and structure. This process is known as differentiation. The cells arrange into distinct layers called germ layers: an outer ectoderm and inner endoderm (entoderm). A third embryonic layer, the mesoderm, develops between the ectoderm and the endoderm. All the organs of the body develop or differentiate in an orderly fashion from these three primary germ layers.

    / Derivation of Tissues
    let derivetissue >
      Cells that are similar in structure tend to group themselves together and form tissues. A tissue, then, is composed of a group of cells that are similar in structure and perform one or more common functions. Some tissues contain intercellular material which is very important in the performance of a particular function belonging to that tissue.

      The body tissues and organs develop from the three primary germ layers that form during the growth process of the human embryo.

      The tissues derived from the ectoderm are: some epithelial tissue (epidermis or outer layer of the skin, the lining for all hollow organs which have cavities open to a surface covered by epidermis), modified epidermal tissue (fingernails and toenails, hair, glands of the skin), all nerve tissue, salivary glands, and mucous glands of the nose and mouth.

      In fact, epithelial tissue can be derived from either the ectoderm or endoderm. The epithelial tissue derived from the endoderm includes the epithelial lining of the digestive tract, except at the open ends, and the epithelial lining of all hollow structures formed as outpockets in the digestive tract. This includes:

      - The parenchyma of the liver including communicating or connecting ducts
      - The lining of the pharynx and respiratory tract (except the nose). This includes the lungs and the passageways leading from the pharynx to the lungs
      - The epithelium of the bladder and urethra
      - Glands that form secretions in the digestive tract

      Epithelial tissue derived from ectoderm is generally squamous epithelium; epithelial tissue derived from endoderm is essentially glandular epithelium.

      There are a variety of body tissues derived from the third or middle primary germ layer known as the mesoderm. These body tissues include:

      - Muscles
      - Fibrous tissue
      - Bone and cartilage
      - Fat or adipose tissue
      - Blood and lymph vessels
      - Blood cells

      In the early embryo the first cavity that develops is the coelomic cavity; this is derived from mesoderm. Parts of the urinary and genital systems are derived as outpouchings of the coelomic cavity. Later this coelomic cavity divides into the pleural cavity and the pericardial cavity. The linings of these cavities are composed of a single layer of cells called mesothelium. A few epithelial cells are of mesodermal origin, e.g. endometrium of the uterus, vaginal epithelium, and mucosa of the bladder.

      Endothelium derived from mesoderm lines the blood and lymphatic vessels and the walls of the heart. In the capillaries where the endothelium is covered only by a basement membrane, diffusion takes place. It is surrounded elsewhere by supportive layers of connective tissue and smooth muscle. This is necessary because the endothelium is so thin that diffusion would occur otherwise. Many authorities classify this endothelium as connective tissue.

    / Cancer Classification
    let classifications >
      Cancers are classified in two ways: by the type of tissue in which the cancer originates (histological type) and by primary site, or the location in the body where the cancer first developed. This section introduces you to the first method: cancer classification based on histological type. The international standard for the classification and nomenclature of histologies is the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3).

      From a histological standpoint there are hundreds of different cancers, which are grouped into six major categories:

      - Carcinoma
      - Sarcoma
      - Myeloma
      - Leukemia
      - Lymphoma
      - Mixed Types

      ## Carcinoma
      Carcinoma refers to a malignant neoplasm of epithelial origin or cancer of the internal or external lining of the body. Carcinomas, malignancies of epithelial tissue, account for 80 to 90 percent of all cancer cases.

      Epithelial tissue is found throughout the body. It is present in the skin, as well as the covering and lining of organs and internal passageways, such as the gastrointestinal tract.

      Carcinomas are divided into two major subtypes: adenocarcinoma, which develops in an organ or gland, and squamous cell carcinoma, which originates in the squamous epithelium.

      Adenocarcinomas generally occur in mucus membranes and are first seen as a thickened plaque-like white mucosa. They often spread easily through the soft tissue where they occur. Squamous cell carcinomas occur in many areas of the body.

      Most carcinomas affect organs or glands capable of secretion, such as the breasts, which produce milk, or the lungs, which secrete mucus, or colon or prostate or bladder.

      ## Sarcoma
      Sarcoma refers to cancer that originates in supportive and connective tissues such as bones, tendons, cartilage, muscle, and fat. Generally occurring in young adults, the most common sarcoma often develops as a painful mass on the bone. Sarcoma tumors usually resemble the tissue in which they grow.

      Examples of sarcomas are:

      - Osteosarcoma or osteogenic sarcoma (bone)
      - Chondrosarcoma (cartilage)
      - Leiomyosarcoma (smooth muscle)
      - Rhabdomyosarcoma (skeletal muscle)
      - Mesothelial sarcoma or mesothelioma (membranous lining of body cavities)
      - Fibrosarcoma (fibrous tissue)
      - Angiosarcoma or hemangioendothelioma (blood vessels)
      - Liposarcoma (adipose tissue)
      - Glioma or astrocytoma (neurogenic connective tissue found in the brain)
      - Myxosarcoma (primitive embryonic connective tissue)
      - Mesenchymous or mixed mesodermal tumor (mixed connective tissue types)

      ## Myeloma
      Myeloma is cancer that originates in the plasma cells of bone marrow. The plasma cells produce some of the proteins found in blood.

      ## Leukemia
      Leukemias ("liquid cancers" or "blood cancers") are cancers of the bone marrow (the site of blood cell production). The word leukemia means "white blood" in Greek. The disease is often associated with the overproduction of immature white blood cells. These immature white blood cells do not perform as well as they should, therefore the patient is often prone to infection. Leukemia also affects red blood cells and can cause poor blood clotting and fatigue due to anemia. Examples of leukemia include:

      - Myelogenous or granulocytic leukemia (malignancy of the myeloid and granulocytic white blood cell series)
      - Lymphatic, lymphocytic, or lymphoblastic leukemia (malignancy of the lymphoid and lymphocytic blood cell series)
      - Polycythemia vera or erythremia (malignancy of various blood cell products, but with red cells predominating)

      ## Lymphoma
      Lymphomas develop in the glands or nodes of the lymphatic system, a network of vessels, nodes, and organs (specifically the spleen, tonsils, and thymus) that purify bodily fluids and produce infection-fighting white blood cells, or lymphocytes. Unlike the leukemias which are sometimes called "liquid cancers," lymphomas are "solid cancers." Lymphomas may also occur in specific organs such as the stomach, breast or brain. These lymphomas are referred to as extranodal lymphomas. The lymphomas are subclassified into two categories: [glossary term:] Hodgkin lymphoma and [glossary term:] Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma diagnostically distinguishes Hodgkin lymphoma from Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      ## Mixed Types
      The type components may be within one category or from different categories. Some examples are:

      - adenosquamous carcinoma
      - mixed mesodermal tumor
      - carcinosarcoma
      - teratocarcinoma

      In the next section, you will be provided with a comprehensive list of tissue types and the tumors that arise from them.

    # see source for extensive tables

    / Tumor List
    let tumorlist >
      Different body tissue types give rise to different tumors, both benign and malignant. The following tables show the different kinds of tumors each of the following tissue types are vulnerable to:

      - Connective Tissue
      - Endothelium and Mesothelium
      - Blood and Lymphoid Cells
      - Muscle
      - Epithelial Tissues
      - Neural
      - APUD System (APUD - Amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation)
      - Other Neural Crest-Derived Cells
      - Tumors
      - Gonadal Tumors

    / Cancer Types by Site
    let sites >
      Medical professionals frequently refer to cancers based on their histological type. However, the general public is more familiar with cancer names based on their primary sites. The most common sites in which cancer develops include:

      - Skin
      - Lungs
      - Female Breasts
      - Prostate
      - Colon and Rectum
      - Cervix and Uterus

      Compared with those based on histological type, cancers named after the primary site may not be as accurate. Take lung cancer for example; the name does not specify the type of tissue involved. It simply indicates where the cancer is located. In fact, depending on how the cells look under a microscope, there are two major types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer can be further divided into various types named for the type of cells in which the cancer develops, typically: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.

      However, it's important to know that cancer can be classified either by the cell type or its primary site. Saying that a woman has uterine carcinoma or uterine cancer is the same thing as saying that she has cancer (or carcinoma) of the uterus.

      Following are some examples of common types of cancers named for their primary site.

      ## Skin
      There are three primary types of skin cancer: basal cell, squamous cell, and melanoma. These cancers are derived from the epidermal layers with the same names. Melanomas are derived from the melanocytes, or pigment cells, in the deepest level of the epidermis.

      Basal cell and squamous cell cancers usually occur on parts of the body exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, and extremities. These cancers are highly curable, especially if detected and treated early. Melanomas, which form dark moles that spread over the surface of the skin, are more lethal because they metastasize very quickly.

      ## Lung
      Lung cancer is very difficult to detect at an early stage because the symptoms often do not appear until the disease has advanced. The symptoms include persistent cough, sputum streaked with blood, chest pain, and repeated attacks of pneumonia or bronchitis.

      ## Female Breast
      It has been estimated that in the U.S., about 1 in 8 women will eventually develop breast cancer in her lifetime. Most breast cancers are ductal carcinomas. Women most likely to develop the disease are those over the age of 50; those who have already had cancer in one breast; those whose mother or sister had breast cancer; those who never had children; and those who had their first child after the age of 30. Other risk factors include obesity, a high-fat diet, early menarche (age menstruation begins) and late menopause (age menstruation ceases).

      Monthly breast self-examination is recommended as a way to detect breast cancer early. Most of the lumps found in the breasts are not cancerous, but women should see their physicians to find out for sure. The American Cancer Society also recommends periodic mammograms (or breast X-rays) for all women over the age of 40 as well as physical examinations of the breast by a physician for all women over the age of 20, even if they have no symptoms of breast cancer.

      ## Prostate
      Cancer of the prostate is found mainly in older men. As men age, the prostate may enlarge and block the urethra or bladder. This may cause difficulty in urination or interfere with sexual functions. This condition is called benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Although BPH is not cancerous, surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of BPH, or of other problems in the prostate, may be similar to symptoms for prostate cancer.

      Individuals should consult a physician if any of the following symptoms appear: weak or interrupted flow of urine; urinating often (especially at night); difficulty urinating; pain or burning during urination; blood in the urine; or nagging pain in the back, hips, or pelvis. Often there are no symptoms of early cancer of the prostate.

      ## Colon and Rectum
      Of the cancers that affect the large intestine, about 70 percent occur in the colon and about 30 percent in the rectum. These cancers are the third most common cancers overall. Symptoms include blood in the stool, which can be tested for by a simple fecal occult blood test, or a change in bowel habits, such as severe constipation or diarrhea.

      ## Uterus (Corpus Uteri)
      The uterus is the sac in a woman's pelvis which allows a baby to develop from a fertilized egg and protects it until birth.

      Cancer of the uterus is the most common gynecologic malignancy. This cancer occurs infrequently in women under 40 years of age. It occurs most frequently after the age of 60. The presenting symptom is usually abnormal uterine bleeding. An endometrial biopsy or D&C is often performed to confirm the diagnosis.

      Currently, there has been little insight into the exact causes for uterine cancer. However, 10-25 percent of malignancies occur in women who received pelvic radiation five to 25 years earlier for benign bleeding. As in other cancers of its type, risk factors for uterine cancer include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and improper estrogen levels.

      In addition to cancer types named after the primary site discussed above, there are many other examples such as brain cancer, testicular cancer, bladder cancer, and so on.

    / Review: Categories of Cancer
    let review >
      Here is what we have learned from Categories of Cancer:

      - Cancers can be classified based either on histological type or their primary site (the location where the cancer originated).
      - Derivation of cells and tissues starts with cell differentiation, which refers to the process of cells becoming arranged into three distinct germ layers: an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a mesoderm in between.
      - All of the organs of the body develop or differentiate from these three primary germ layers.
      - Tissue is composed of a group of cells that are similar in structure and perform one or more common functions.
      - Five major categories of cancer, based on their histological characteristics, are: carcinoma; sarcoma; myeloma; leukemia; and lymphoma. In addition, there are also some mixed types.
      - The most common sites in which cancer develops include the skin, lungs, female breasts, prostate, colon and rectum, and uterus.

    / Introduction
    let intro >
      The diagnosis of cancer entails an attempt to accurately identify the anatomical site of origin of the malignancy and the type of cells involved. Cancer can arise in any organ or tissue in the body except fingernails, hair, and teeth.

      The site refers to the location of the cancer within the body. The body part in which cancer first develops is known as the primary site. A cancer's primary site may determine how the tumor will behave; whether and where it may spread (metastasize) and what symptoms it is most likely to cause. The most common sites in which cancer develops include the skin, lungs, female breasts, prostate, colon and rectum, and corpus uteri.

      Secondary site refers to the body part where metastasized cancer cells grow and form secondary tumors. A cancer is always described in terms of the primary site, even if it has spread to another part of the body. For instance, advanced breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes under the arm and to the bone and lungs is always considered breast cancer (and the spread to the lymph nodes, bones, and lungs describe the stage of the cancer).

      As is the case with other medical conditions, there are many signs and symptoms that may indicate the presence of cancer. These may be observed directly, through imaging technologies, or confirmed by lab tests. However, these signs and symptoms of cancer may resemble those of other conditions. For example, weight loss and abdominal pain can be caused by stomach cancer or an ulcer. Pink or reddish urine can be caused by kidney cancer or a kidney infection. A positive fecal occult blood test can indicate a variety of intestinal problems. A biopsy (removal of tissue for microscopic evaluation) is preferred to establish, or rule out, a diagnosis of cancer.

      Tissue samples can be easily retrieved from a tumor near the body's surface. If the mass is inaccessible, an imaging exam that enables a tumor to be located precisely and visualized may be ordered before the biopsy is performed.

      The histological type is determined by microscopic examination of suspected tissue that has been excised by biopsy or surgical resection. If the histological type is different from what is usually found in the tissue being examined, it can mean the cancer has spread to that area from some primary site. Metastasis can occur by direct extension, via the blood stream or the lymphatic system, or by seeding or implantation of cancer cells.

      A biopsy, together with advanced imaging technologies, may not only confirm the presence of cancer, but may also pinpoint the primary site and secondary site(s).

      It is also important to identify the cell type(s). Various histological types have different growth rates and dissimilar prognoses. More than one histological type of cell may be found in the same site. For example, a tumor whose primary site is skin can be a basal cell carcinoma, a squamous cell carcinoma, or a melanoma.

      Once cancer has been confirmed, the pathologist tries to determine how closely the cancer cells resemble healthy, mature cells. Such cells are said to be differentiated. Cancer cells that do not look like their healthy counterparts are called undifferentiated, or, because they often look like very immature cells, primitive. The pathologist assigns a pathological grade to a tumor according to how aggressive the tissue looks under the microscope. Tumor grades can be expressed in words or by a number. One set of terms consists of well differentiated (grade 1), moderately differentiated (grade 2), poorly differentiated (grade 3), or undifferentiated (grade 4). When tumors are graded by number (1 through 4), a grade-1 tumor has a better natural history than a grade-4 tumor does.

      Cancers are further classified according to stage. Staging describes how far a cancer has progressed based on the size of the primary tumor and whether and/or where it has spread. Go to the Summary Staging and Summary Stage 2000 training module for more details on cancer staging.

      In summary, a biopsy is the preferred method to confirm the diagnosis of cancer. Biopsies can provide information about histological type, classification, grade, potential aggressiveness and other information that may help determine the best treatment. More information regarding cancer treatment is provided in the Cancer Treatment training module.

    let intro >
      Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death. The following facts will help us understand the importance of the "War on Cancer."

      More than 1.2 million Americans develop cancer each year. A new cancer is diagnosed every 30 seconds in the United States. Since 1990, nearly 15 million new cancer cases have been diagnosed. These estimates do not include carcinoma in situ (non-invasive cancer) of any site except urinary bladder and do not include the basal and squamous cell skin cancers.

      Lung and prostate cancer are the top cancer killers for men in the United States. Lung and breast cancer are the top cancer killers for women in the United States. One in two men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during his lifetime. One in three women in the US will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during her lifetime.

      Cancer is the second leading cause of death after heart disease in the United States. It is the primary cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 74. About 8,000 American children will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Cancer is the chief cause of death in children between the ages of 1 and 14.

      If current trends continue, cancer is expected to be the leading cause of death in the United States by the year 2010. One in five persons in the US will die from cancer. Every three minutes, two people in the US die from cancer.

      Based on estimates of the National Institutes of Health, overall costs for cancer in the year 2000 was $180.2 billion: $60 billion for direct medical costs (total of all health expenditures); $15 billion for indirect morbidity costs (cost of lost productivity due to illness); and $105.2 billion for indirect mortality costs (cost of lost productivity due to premature death). Cancer-related costs account for about 10 percent of the total amount spent on disease treatment in the United States. Cancer is a major national burden.

      In 1970, the American people knew what they wanted -- a cure for the second-leading cause of death. President Nixon heard the voice of the people and the concerns of the medical profession. In his January 1971 State of the Union address, President Nixon made a special request for an additional $100 million to be added to the NCI budget for cancer research. In October 1971 he converted the Army's Fort Detrick, Maryland, biological warfare facility to a cancer research center. The resulting Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center eventually became an internationally recognized laboratory for cancer and AIDS research. However, President Nixon took a much bigger step when he signed the National Cancer Act into law on December 23, 1971, declaring, "I hope in the years ahead we will look back on this action today as the most significant action taken during my Administration."

      After more than three decades, the "War on Cancer," declared by President Nixon in 1971 with the enactment of the National Cancer Act, is still going on in this country. The Question is: "Are we winning the war?"

      Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to the question. The good news is that since Nixon's initiative, there have been incredible advances in cancer detection, prevention, and treatment. Since the mid 1990s, the cancer death rate has been decreasing steadily. As one cancer experts puts it: "It's just amazing those who are making it and are living, whereas 10 years ago these same people would not have lived." A diagnosis of cancer once was the virtual equivalent of a death sentence. Today, nearly half of all cancer patients can expect to live for five or more years after the diagnosis of cancer.

      However, scientists are still not able to pinpoint a "cause" for cancer. Instead, cancer researchers now believe that cancer can be triggered by many factors, such as our genetics, diet and occupation. We know that our chances of developing cancer can be significantly reduced if we choose to live a healthy lifestyle, not smoke and avoid certain foods.

      Finally, while a "cure" for cancer has not yet been found, scientists are more confident than ever that further breakthroughs in cancer detection and therapy are not far away, allowing us to effectively control the disease.

      / Introduction to Staging
      let intro >
        The concept of describing disease by stage or extent was introduced in 1929 by the League of Nation's World Health Organization. Staging is a common language developed by medical professionals to communicate information about a disease to others. The disease can be any acute or chronic disease such as cancer, diabetes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cardiovascular disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. The first primary site so described was cancer of the cervix.

        Staging for cancer has evolved over many years. Many groups have developed different staging systems. Some staging systems cover all sites; others are limited to particular ages of patients, histology, sites, study groups, or medical specialties. This learning module briefly discusses common staging schemes and classifications. The three most common staging systems used in hospital and central registries are discussed in detail.

        Staging is a shorthand method for describing disease. A coded format, such as a numerical system with increasing values meaning more involvement or severity, allows electronic analysis of cases with similar characteristics.

        A short definition for staging is "the grouping of cases into broad categories based on extent of disease." Extent of disease is a detailed description of how far the tumor has spread from organ or site of origin (the primary site). Extent of disease is an anatomic categorization using descriptors to group individual cases in relation to the human body.

        As stated in the National Cancer Registrars Association Workbook for Staging Cancer,

        > Classification is the process of grouping cases based on specific criteria. Classification is an orderly arrangement showing relationships among groups. Classification does not necessarily imply a prognosis.

        > The relationship between staging, extent of disease and classification is: extent of disease is a type of classification (based on human anatomy) and pertains to an individual case. Staging is coded shorthand or a notation describing disease in more general terms. By staging, characteristics about a case (precise extent of disease information) can be grouped into categories. Thus staging translates extent of disease classification about individual cancers into groups that can be studied or evaluated for prognostic significance.

        Elements to be considered in any staging system are the primary tumor site, tumor size, multiplicity (number of tumors), depth of invasion and extension to regional or distant tissues, involvement of regional lymph nodes, and distant metastases.

      / Purpose of Staging
      let purpose >
        There are several reasons for staging cancer cases. One reason is that the need for staging places a responsibility on the medical practitioner to adequately assess the extent of cancer in order to treat the disease in the most appropriate manner. Another reason is that knowing the extent of disease assists the physician to determine the most appropriate treatment to cure the disease, decrease the tumor burden, or relieve symptoms.

        Staging is also used to indicate [glossary term:] prognosis for an individual patient. Data from historical sources can provide an estimate of the expected survival rate for a particular cancer with a corresponding extent of disease. Of course, histology and grade of tumor, patient demographics such as age, sex, and race, and the efficacy of therapy all play a part in determining the patient's prognosis and quality of survival.

        Staging provides a means of comparing local treatment results with national data based on common criteria for the extent of disease. Staging expedites the exchange of data and assists in the continuing research on cancer. Health information records are the primary source of documentation for staging information.

      / The Disease Process of Cancer
      let process >
        According to the most widely accepted theory of cancer development, cancer originates in a single cell somewhere in the body. The cell divides and grows in the organ of origin, causing a localized tumor. Cancer cells then spread to adjacent tissues or regional lymph node drainage areas, and then advance to distant organs or structures, creating metastatic tumors. Cancer can spread directly from the organ of origin through the bloodstream into distant organs without involving adjacent organs and regional lymph nodes.

        Many cancers go through a matured course, advancing in tumor size or involvement to regional nodal involvement and eventually to distant metastasis. Small tumors can metastasize, with the first sign of the cancer being the metastasis.

        Here is what we have learned from Introduction to Staging:

        - Staging is a common language developed by medical professionals to communicate information about a disease to others.
        - A short definition for staging is the grouping of cases into broad categories based on extent of disease.
        - Elements to be considered in any staging system are the primary tumor site, tumor size, multiplicity (number of tumors), depth of invasion and extension to regional or distant tissues, involvement of regional lymph nodes, and distant metastases.

          - Understanding the extent of disease assists the physician determining the most appropriate treatment to cure the disease, decrease the tumor burden, or relieve symptoms.
          - Staging is also used to indicate prognosis.
          - Staging provides a means of comparing local institutional experience with national data.
        - According to the theory of cancer growth or the natural history of cancer, cancer originates in a single cell. The cell continues to divide and grow in the organ of origin, spreads to adjacent tissues or regional lymph node drainage areas, and then spreads to distant organs or structures.

      / Physical Exam
      let physical >
        For most cancers, the report of the physical examination should include the location of tumor, including site and sub site, direct extension of the tumor to other organs or structures, and palpability and mobility of accessible lymph nodes. The probability of distant site involvement, such as organomegaly, pleural effusion, [glossary term:] ascites, or neurological findings should be stated. In a breast cancer case, for example, the physical examination should describe the exact location of the tumor mass, clinical size of the tumor, and the condition of the skin surrounding the tumor, including changes in skin color and texture and attachment or fixation of the mass. The exam should include the entire axial and regional nodal area including the supraclavicular nodes.

        Tumors of the head and neck area are evaluated with a general exam of the face and neck. The eyes, skin, ears, and nasal cavity should be examined in addition to mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, oral cavity, orpharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Digital and bimanual palpation of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and neck should be included in the physical exam.

        Some organ sites are not easily examined clinically. A patient suspected of having a gastrointestinal tumor should have external palpation of the liver and abdomen. Females should have both a digital rectal exam and a pelvic exam. Males should have a digital rectal exam. Suspected lung cancer patients should have an assessment of cervical and supraclavicular nodal areas.

        In all cases, other than lymphomas, nodes must be described by a clinician as "involved" in order to be considered to contain cancer. For example, if it is stated that the nodes are enlarged, they are not considered to contain cancer until there is cytological or pathologic confirmation. If there is matting or fixation, the medical practitioner may state that the nodes are involved with cancer.

      / Radiologic Procedures
      space radiologic
        >>>
          X-rays, scans, and endoscopic procedures are useful for staging purposes. Radiological reports should define the location of the cancer, the size of the tumor, involvement of adjacent structures, or existence of distant disease. They can help determine the resectability of the tumor. All radiologic reports should be reviewed to determine the extent of disease.

          According to the Commission on Cancer (COC) of the American College of Surgeons, the following terms are to be interpreted as evidence of tumor involvement: adherent, apparent, compatible with, consistent with, encroaching upon, fixation/fixed, induration, into, onto, out onto, probable, suspect, and suspicious. The following terms are to be interpreted as no tumor involvement: approaching, equivocal, possible, questionable, suggests, and very close to.

        / X-rays
        let xrays >
          The most common x-ray is the chest film, which is used for a variety of purposes. The posteranterior and lateral chest x-rays are simple methods of detecting lung cancers or lesions metastatic to the lung from other primary cancer sites. The x-ray can show the tumor size, location, obstruction, pleural effusion, or invasion of adjacent structures such as the chest wall or [glossary term:] mediastinum.

          Mammography is an x-ray technique used to diagnose abnormalities in the breast. Usually, two views are taken of each breast, and the radiographs are examined for lesions or micro calcifications. The mammogram is useful in localizing suspicious nonpalpable lesions. The area of concern is visualized while the breast is in the mammography unit. The radiologist injects dye or inserts a special hookwire needle into the suspicious area. The surgeon is then able to excise the abnormal area.

          The most common x-ray used for the diagnosis of colon cancer is the barium enema. The large colon is filled with a barium solution and multiple x-ray films are taken. Polyps, as well as constricted and obstructed areas, can be seen. The upper GI series is useful in diagnosing lesions of the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.

          One common radiological exam used in the study of the urinary tract is the KUB, a frontal film of the abdomen used to examine the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. There are several other urinary tract x-ray exams that use a contrast medium (a radiopaque substance to delineate and define the contour of the structures). The intravenous [glossary term:] pyelogram (IVP) follows the injection of the contrast media into a vein and displays the path of the media through the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. A retrograde urogram is carried out by inserting a cystoscope into the ureteral meatus, inserting a catheter through the cystoscope, and adding a contrast solution to study the renal pelvis and ureters. The location and size of the tumors of the urinary tract can often be defined through these x-rays studies.

          An angiogram is an x-ray study of the vascular system that is used to diagnose some cancers. A cerebral angiogram helps define the blood supply to brain lesions. [glossary term:] Lymphangiograms are useful in the study of vessels of the lymphatic system. They were widely used as a staging workshop for lymphomas before the widespread availability of CT and MRI scanning.

        / Scans
        let scans >
          Computerized axial tomography (CT) scanning is used for the examination of many parts of the body. The scan's images show cross-sectional 'slices" of the body that are each a millimeter thick. A composite image is created by the computer and photocopied. The CT scan gives an accurate picture of the extent of the disease and helps identify tumors at an early stage. CT scans are performed both with and without contrast media. CT scans can be taken of the head, chest, abdomen, pelvis, or the whole body. When a case is tagged, the entire report should be reviewed for correct interpretation of the areas that are involved or not involved with tumor. Enlarged lymph nodes may also be seen on the CT scans.

          Diagnostic nuclear medicine examinations or scans are used to identify abnormalities in the brain, salivary glands, thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, liver, spleen, and bone. The patient is given a radioisotope that emits gamma rays and permits the radiologist to see abnormal structures or functions. Bone scans can show metastatic lytic (destructive) lesions or blastic (overgrowth of bone) lesions of bone. For example, breast and prostate cancers are known to metastasize to the bone. Therefore, a bone scan may confirm or rule out the distant spread of the disease. Liver and spleen scans show the presence and size of a tumor. Brain scans can indicate the location of a tumor, size, and associated vascular structures.

      / Tumor Markers
      let markers >
        Cytologic tumor markers are tumor-specific substances in the blood serum or other tissues that can assist in determining the presence or absence of cancer. They can help determine the initial tumor burden in both the primary site and distant sites. Tumor markers can be helpful in monitoring for recurrence. Care should be taken to seek tumor marker information to assist in determining stage.

        The most common tumor markers used for prognosis in breast cancer are the estrogen receptor assay (ERA) and the progesterone receptor assay (PRA). Both are steroid hormones receptors. ERA and PRA are used to estimate the potential response to endocrine, or hormone, therapy. They help in the determination of prognosis and the management of breast cancer patients. Pieces of breast cancer tissue are analyzed in the laboratory to determine the ERA and PRA. The presence of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors denotes whether the cancer is growing in the presence of either or both naturally occurring hormones.

        Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA-15-3), a tumor associated [glossary term:] glycoprotein, is found in the serum. It can be useful in monitoring the presence of metastatic breast cancer and the patient's response to chemotherapy.

        Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a proteolytic enzyme, is used as a screening mechanism for prostate cancer. It can monitor the presence of metastatic disease in patients who have undergone a radical prostatectomy. PSA is not effective for mass screenings because elevated PSAs can also be found in aging patients and in association with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostatitis.

        One oncofetal antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), has been used for many years to monitor colon, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Rising serum levels of CEA may indicate disease recurrence many months prior to clinical manifestations.

        Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is a glycoprotein associated with ovarian carcinoma cells. Elevated levels appear in about 75 per cent of ovarian cancer patients and may be associated with tumor burden and recurrence. CA-125 is used to monitor patients for residual or recurrent disease.

        Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is an oncofetal antigen that is useful in monitoring patients with nonseminomatous testicular cancer and certain types of ovarian cancer. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone that can be detected to assess the prognosis and to monitor treatment response in patients with germ cell tumors, breast cancer, choriocarcinoma, and testicular carcinoma.

        [glossary term:] Flow cytometry has recently become an important clinical test to determine cellular DNA ploidy (the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell) and S-phase (the percentage of cells in active DNA synthesis). In flow cytometry, cells are stained with a special dye and then analyzed in a flow cytometer by using a laser beam to measure the fluorescence of cells. The results are charted in a histogram showing the distribution of DNA in the cells. Results of flow cytometry are helpful to determine prognosis, monitor treatment response, and document tumor recurrence. Tumors demonstrating an abnormal number of chromosomes, such as tetraploidy, polyploidy, or aneuploidy, are more likely to be aggressive than tumors that are diploid (that have the normal two sets of chromosomes). Tumors with a low S-phase have a better prognosis.

      / Pathologic Exams
      let pathologic >
        The most common diagnosis and accurate methods of diagnosing cancer include microscopic examination of either tissue or cells. Cells examined are usually obtained from fluid around the suspected site of cancer. Tissues examined are usually removed from the primary or metastatic site of a cancer.

        There are many kinds of biopsies to remove tissue for a cancer diagnosis. An aspiration biopsy is obtained by using a needle to suction fluid, cells, or tissue into a syringe. A bone marrow biopsy is the removal of bone marrow from one of the body's larger hollow bones such as the femur or pelvic bone.

        Excisional biopsies attempt to remove the entire tumor. Incisional biopsies remove only a portion of the tissue. Often, the biopsy specimens are quickly frozen, thinly sliced, and examined to determine the presence of absence of cancer cells (frozen sections). Permanent sections are then made, and the diagnosis from the permanent sections should take precedence over frozen section reports.

        Surgical resections involve removing more tissue from the body, including margins of normal tissue and/or regional lymph nodes. The pathologist can often determine staging by examining the primary tumor, surrounding tissues, and regional nodes when there is a "total" resection of the tumor. The information from a total resection takes precedence over biopsy reports and operative notes.

        Quite often, there are several tissue samples, biopsies, or surgical resections for one cancer. When staging a cancer, it is important to review all pathological reports for the clinical diagnosis, gross description of the specimen and postoperative diagnosis.

        The gross description of the specimen should include the total size of the tumor. Both the gross and the microscopic descriptions should state whether the surgical margins are involved by tumor. The pathology report should contain information about the primary site and the spread of the disease in surrounding tissues. It is important to note all areas, organs, or structures involved with tumor.

        The pathology report contains the histologic type of cancer and the grade of the tumor (how closely the cancer cells resemble normal tissue). Grade is normally expressed as Grade I through III or as well differentiated, moderately differentiate, and poorly differentiated, respectively. Tumors can also be described as anaplastic or undifferentiated (Grade IV).

        The final diagnosis of the histological type takes precedence over preliminary reports and frozen sections. The microscopic description takes precedence over the gross description. Occasionally, pathological specimens are sent to other centers for consultation, and the final pathology report may not be signed until all consultations have been returned.

        The most important information in a pathology report includes source of the specimen, primary site, tumor size, histologic type of cancer, grade of tumor, and the extent of the disease within the organ of origin and beyond. The type, size, location and number of lymph nodes removed, and number of nodes containing tumor should be noted. This information is often required for accurate staging.

        Pieces of chips of tumor should not be added together to determine tumor size. If the patient has received preoperative radiation therapy, the size of the tumor should be recorded as found in radiology reports prior to radiation therapy. Multifocal and multicentric are synonymous terms. The size of the largest of the multifocal tumors should be used for staging.

        Autopsy reports are a type of pathology report that contains detailed information about organs and structures of the body. An autopsy is considered to be an ultimate pathology report. In summary, pathology reports, or reports of tissue, contain information about biopsies, frozen sections, tissue aspiration or biopsy of bone marrow, surgical specimens and autopsies.

        Cytology reports describe the microscopic examination of cells in body fluids such a sputum, bronchial washings and brushings, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, spinal fluid, aspirations from bone marrow, and cervical smears. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, used for detection of abnormal cervical cells, is probably the most widely known cytology specimen. Cells can also be obtained by fine-needle aspiration to diagnose cancers of the liver, pancreas, breast, and lung. The most common ways of obtaining cells include brushing the lining of an organ, puncturing the cavity and removing fluid, scraping the lining, or using a swab to obtain secretions.

        [glossary term:] Thoracentesis is a puncturing of the thoracic, or chest cavity for the removal of fluid. Paracentesis is the puncture of the abdominal cavity for removal of fluid.

        There may be multiple cytology reports. It is important to note the source of the specimen, the histologic description, and pertinent findings, along with interpretations.

      / Surgical Reports
      let surgical >
        All surgical procedures should be noted in a written operative report, either as a separate entry or as part of progress report. Pertinent observations from operative procedures should be noted, including the location of the tumor and any direct extension, nodal involvement, or metastatic spread. Information from the operative or procedure report supplements the information noted in the pathology report. The operative report should state whether the procedure is considered curative or palliative. If a pallative procedure is done, any residual tumor remaining may be biopsied.

        Non-cancer directed surgeries such a cystotomy, gastrotomy, laparotomy, and thoracotomy may contribute information on involvement of organs, tissues, or lymph nodes that were not resected. Bypass surgery may be performed to create a passage around a tumor, often for palliation of symptoms. Bypass surgeries such as esophagogastrostomy, gastrostomy, and urethrostomy may provide information on the extent of the tumor involvement.

        To summarize, cancer-directed surgery reports should describe the removal and size of the tumor. Observations of regional lymph nodes, adjacent structures, and organs should be included. The pathology report will confirm the presence or absence of tumor in resected specimens.

      / Progress Notes and Discharge Summaries
      let notes >
        Progress notes summarize diagnostic findings and patient status on a daily basis. The progress notes should be read to supplement and clarify information from laboratory tests, x-rays, scans, endoscopies, procedures, and histologic reports. The final progress note or the discharge summary should summarize all diagnostic, surgical, and pathological findings. The stage of cancer should be stated.

      / Introduction
      let intro >
        The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute collects cancer data from designated populated-based cancer registries in various areas of the country. There are two staging classifications developed by SEER: extent of disease and summary stage. Extent of disease (EOD) coding is required for all SEER programs funded through the National Cancer Institute.

        The {'coc Commission on Cancer} of the American College of Surgeons requires that the {'ajcc American Joint Committee on Cancer} staging system be completed on all applicable sites and histologies. The COC and {'npcr NPCR} require summary staging on the sites or histologies not included in AJCC staging.

        ## General Guidelines for Staging all Schemes
        - Stage grouping can only be applied to cancers that are alike in site, histology, or both.
        - Accurate and complete assessment of the cancer is necessary before staging.
        - Rule out distant disease first. When metastatic disease is documented, there may be no need to look for information about the primary tumor and regional lymph node status.
        - A few cases are unstageable. The "unstageable" category should be assigned only after all efforts to identify the extent of the disease have been exhausted or the site or histology does not meet criteria for staging.
        - It is mandatory to stage uniformly using the same staging classification in order to compare data or results.
        - If staging information is unclear, it is important to seek further information in order to ensure the quality of data.

        / What is Summary Staging?
        let intro >
          Summary staging is based on the theory of cancer growth previously described earlier in the section Disease Process of Cancer. Summary staging is also called General Staging, California Staging, SEER Staging. It is the most basic staging system and is applicable to all anatomic sites (solid tumors, not leukemias). Summary Staging uses all information available in the medical record, clinical, and pathological. It is frequently used by tumor registries, but not always understood by physicians.

          There are limitations for the staging system: categories are so broad that there is a wide variety of cases included; detailed analysis of a case with specific characteristics is sometimes not possible.

          Listed below are the five main categories of Summary Staging:

          - In situ
          - Localized
          - Regionalized
          - Distant
          - Unknown

          ## Guidelines For Summary Staging
          Rule out distant disease first. If metastases can be documented, there is no need to spend a great deal of time identifying local or regional spread.
          Carcinomas and melanomas are the only types of cancer that can be classified as in situ. Sarcomas are never described as in situ.
          If there is any evidence of invasion, nodal involvement or metastatic spread, the case is not in situ even if the pathology report so states. This is a common error in staging cervical cancer where the path report states that the cancer is "in situ with microinvasion"—such a case would be staged as localized.
          In order for a lesion to be classified as localized, it must not extend beyond the outer limits of the organ and there must be no evidence of metastases anywhere else.
          For carcinomas, if there are lymph nodes involved with the tumor, the stage is at least regionalized.
          If a specific chain of lymph nodes is not named and there is no indication in the chart of its location, assume that the nodes are regional.
          If nodes, organs, or adjacent tissues are not specifically mentioned in the description of the various categories, attempt to cross-reference the term you have with those outlined. If there is no match, assume the site in question represents distant disease.
          If there is not enough information in the record to categorize a case, it must be recorded as unstageable.

        / In Situ
        let insitu >
          ## Definition:
          The presence of malignant cells within the cell group from which they arose; no penetration of basement membrane of the tissue; no stromal invasion.

          In situ means "in place". It applies to epithelial tissue only (no such thing as "sarcoma in situ"). The tumor must be microscopically diagnosed in order to visualize the basement membrane. If the tumor is shown to be microinvasive, case is considered localized.

          ## Synonyms:
          non- or pre-invasive, non-infiltrating, intra-epithelial, Stage 0, intraductal, intracystic, no stromal invasion, no penetration below the basement membrane.

        / Localized
        let localized >
          ## Definition:
          A malignancy limited to the organ of origin; no spread beyond organ of origin; infiltration past basement membrane of epithelium into stroma of organ.

          Tumor can be widely invasive or even show metastases within the organ itself and still be considered "confined to organ of origin") or localized. Usually a straightforward stage determination for organs which have definite boundaries (prostate, testis, stomach, etc.) or sites where there is a clear line between the organ of origin and the surrounding region. (Exception: skin)

          For internal organs, it is generally impossible to determine whether tumor is localized without exploratory surgery. However, the increasing sophistication of many imaging techniques is predicted to eventually make exploratory surgery obsolete.

          Read both pathology reports and operative reports for comments on gross evidence of spread, microscopic extension and metastases. Also read diagnostic imaging reports for mention of distant disease. If path report, operative report and other investigations show no evidence of spread, tumor may be assumed to be localized.

          When staging cases are diagnosed clinically only, it is better to record as "stage not recorded" than "localized" when there is no other evidence of spread. Recognize the names of different structures within the organ (such as lamina propria, myometrium, muscularis) so that reference to invasion of such structures will not be interpreted as regional spread.

        / Regionalized
        let regionalized >
          ## Definition:
          Tumor extension beyond limits of organ of origin. Formal (scientific) definition: "That area extending from the periphery of an involved organ that lends itself to removal en bloc with a portion of—or an entire—organ with outer limits to include at least the first level nodal basin."

          Delineation of the outer limit between regional and distant spread is not always clear (can be defined differently by different physicians). En bloc resection not always feasible or may have been shown not to be necessary. (Example: decline in the use of radical mastectomy to treat breast cancer)

          Regionalized tumors are most difficult to categorize properly.

          ## Subcategories:

          - Regional by direct extension;
          - Regional to lymph nodes;
          - Regional both by direct extension and lymph nodes;and
          - Regional, not otherwise specified.

          ## Methods of Spread:

          A. Invasion through entire wall of organ into surrounding organs and/or adjacent tissues ("direct extension" or "contiguous spread").
          B. Tumor invasion of walls of lymphatics where cells can travel through lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes where they are "filtered" out and begin to grow in the nodes.
          C. Combination of direct extension and lymph node involvement.

          Cancer becomes regionalized when there is the potential for spread by more than one lymphatic or vascular supply route. Examples:

          -  Tumor in hepatic flexure of colon with extension along lumen to ascending colon—stage as localized because both areas drain to the same lymph nodes.
          - Sigmoid tumor extending into rectum—stage as regional because tumor now has potential for tumor cell drainage to both the iliac and mesenteric nodes.

          ## Guidelines for Staging Regionalized Disease:

          Principle of bracketing or exclusion:

          - Rule out "confined to organ"—establish that tumor is more than localized.
          - Rule out distant spread by reading operative report for comments about seeding, implants, live nodules, etc., and read diagnostic reports for references to distant disease.
          - If local and distant categories have been ruled out, case is regionalized.

          Terminology to watch carefully:

          - "Local" as in "carcinoma of the stomach with involvement of the local lymph nodes." Local nodes are the first group of nodes to drain the primary. Unless evidence of distant spread is present, such a case should be staged as regional lymph nodes, not localized.
          - "Metastases" as in "carcinoma of lung with peribronchial lymph node metastases." Metastases in this sense means involvement by the tumor. Such a case would still be regionalized. Learn the names of regional nodes for each primary site.

        / Distant
        let distant >
          ## Definition:
          1. A tumor which has spread to areas of the body distant or remote from the primary tumor.
          2. Distant metastases are comprised of tumor cells which have broken away from the primary tumor and have traveled to other parts of the body.
          3. Also called remote, disseminated, diffuse, metastatic.

          ## Methods of Spread:
          A. Extension from primary organ beyond adjacent tissue into next organ. Example: lung to pleura or lung to bone (rib).
          B. Travel in lymph channels beyond the first drainage area. Tumor cells can be filtered, trapped and grown in any lymph nodes in the body.
          C. Hematogenous or blood-borne metastases. Invasion of blood vessels within the primary tumor (veins are more susceptible to invasion than thicker-walled arteries) allows escape of tumor cells or tumor emboli which are transported through the blood stream to another part of the body where it lodges in a capillary or arteriole. At that point the tumor penetrates the vessel wall and grows back into the surrounding tissue.
          D. Spread through fluids in a body cavity. Example: malignant cells released into the thoracic or peritoneal cavity float in the fluid and can land on and begin to grow on any tissue reached by the fluid. Also called: implantation or seeding metastases. Forms large quantities of fluid which can be removed but rapidly re-accumulate. Note: The presence of fluid or ascites does not automatically indicate dissemination there must be cytologic evidence of malignant cells.

          ## Common Sites of Spread:
          Common sites of spread are liver, lung, brain, bones. These organs receive blood flow from all parts of the body. However, if the primary site is adjacent, review staging scheme for that site to make sure the disease is not a regional extension. (Example: Liver involvement from primary in gallbladder may be regional by direct extension, since the gallbladder is adjacent to the liver.)

          ## Guidelines for Staging Distant Disease:
          - If distant metastases are recorded on x-ray or needle biopsy, the stage is already determined and the patient does not need to be put through a lot of other tests.
          - Hematopoietic diseases (leukemia and myeloma) are considered disseminated at time of diagnosis.
          - In recording extent of disease, not whether there is a lymphatic or vascular invasion and/or spread, which organs are involved, whether there is a single focus or multiple foci of tumor.
          - Terms such as "blood vessel invasion" or "perineural lymphatic invasion" should not be the sole basis for staging a tumor as distant.
          - If tumor at primary has invaded lymph or blood vessels, there is the potential for malignant cells to be transported throughout the body. Step 1 (invasion) has occurred, but steps 2 (transport) and 3 (growth) may not.
          - Vascular invasion within the primary is not a determining factor in changing the stage unless there is definite evidence of tumor at distant sites.

          1. There will be cases for which sufficient evidence is not available to adequately assign stage (Examples: Patient expires before workup is completed, patient refuses procedure, and patient is limited to workup due to age or simultaneous contraindicating condition).
          2. Assign "unstageable" or "not recorded" reluctantly. Contact the physician to see if there is more information about the case which is not in the record (diagnostic studies performed prior to admission, and so forth).
          3. If sufficient information does not exist, do not guess. There is no choice but to mark the case as unstageable.

          The concept of a classification scheme that would encompass all aspects of cancer distribution in terms of primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M) was first introduced by the International Union Against Cancer, or Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC), in 1958 for worldwide use. The American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and End Results Reporting (AJC) was established in 1959. The AJC changed its name to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) in 1980. Staging schemes were developed to be consistent with the practice of medicine in America and used the basic premise of the TNM system: cancers of similar histology or site of origin share similar patterns of growth and extension. This group published a series of site-specific staging schemes form 1962 until 1974. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) published the first edition of the Manual for Staging of Cancer in 1977. Every few years, a new edition is published with updates and new schemes for additional cancer sites.

          The AJCC staging scheme is based on the evaluation of the T, N, and M components and the assignment of a stage grouping. The T element designates the size and invasiveness of the primary tumor. The numerical value increases with tumor size and extent of invasiveness. For example, a small lesion confined to the organ of origin would be coded as T1; larger tumor size or deeper extension into adjacent structures, tissues, capsules, or ligaments as T2; larger tumor size or extension beyond the organ of origin but confined to the region, T3; and a massive lesion or one that directly invades another organ or viscera, major nerves, arteries, or bone, T4.

          The N component designates the presence or absence of tumor in the regional nodes. In some sites there is an increasing numerical valued based on size, fixation, or capsular invasion. In other sites, numerical value is based on multiple node involvement or number of location and the regional lymph nodes.

          The M component identifies the presence or absence of distant metastases, including lymph nodes that are not regional.

          The stage group is assigned using the table listed in each chapter. Stage 0 reflects minimal involvement, usually carcinoma in-situ, whereas Stage IV indicates either greatest tumor involvement or distant metastasis.

          The general rules for the AJCC staging system are defined in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer. Further explanation can be found in the UICC TNM Supplement 1993 and the Workbook for Staging of Cancer, a self-instructional book published by the National Cancer Registrars Association. Before staging a cancer, the appropriate site-specific staging system must be determined. Certain sites include only specific tumor histologic types. Some sites require microscopic confirmation to verify the histology in order to stage the cancer.

          The staging basis is determined by the point of evaluation. Clinical staging basis is assigned after the staging workup is completed but before any definitive treatment has begun. Evaluation is based on information from the physical exam, imaging, endoscopy evaluations, and biopsy (biopsy information can only be used for T value if size is not a criteria for the T value). The clinical staging basis is defined for each site in the AJCC Manual for Staging Cancer. Rules applicable to one site do not necessarily apply to another.

          The pathologic staging basis is assigned after the resection of the primary tumor and analysis of the surgical specimen. Most sites also require the removal and examination of regional lymph nodes. Each site chapter must be reviewed for the applicable rules.

          Two other staging bases are less commonly used. An autopsy staging basis is completed after the death and postmortem examination of a patient. Recurrent or retreatment staging is applied after a disease-free interval and when further treatment is planned. Biopsy confirmation is required.

      / Review: Staging Systems
      let review >
          Here is what we have learned from Staging Systems:

          There are two staging classifications developed by SEER: extent of disease and summary stage. Extent of disease (EOD) coding is required for all SEER programs funded through the National Cancer Institute.
          Summary staging is the most basic staging system and it is based on the theory of cancer growth, which uses all information available in the medical record, clinical, and pathological.
          The EOD coding scheme consists of a ten-digit code. It incorporates three digits for the size and/or involvement of the primary tumor, two for the extension of the tumor, and one more as a general code for lymph node involvement. Four more digits are used after these six: two for the number of pathologically positive regional lymph nodes and two more for the number of regional lymph nodes that are pathologically examined.
          The AJCC staging scheme is based on the evaluation of the T, N, and M components and the assignment of a stage grouping.
          FIGO is a gynecologic staging scheme based on clinical staging and careful clinical examination before any definitive therapy has begun.
          Duke's staging (generic term) is a pathological staging based on resection of the tumor and measures the depth of invasion through the mucosa and bowel wall, and it is used for colon and rectum.
          Two classification schemes are often used for melanoma: Breslow's microstaging and Clark's Level of Invasion.

    / Time Frames Considerations in Staging
    space time
      >>>
        The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Extent of Disease coding is limited to all information available within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression or through completion of surgery(ies) in first course of treatment, whichever is longer.

        For SEER Summary Stage 2000, the stage should include all information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer.

        The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) clinical staging is determined after the staging workup is completed and before any treatment has started. AJCC pathologic staging is completed after the resection of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, before additional treated is initiated. There is no predetermined time limit for assigning AJCC clinical or pathological stage.

    / Common Concerns for Staging
    space concerns
      >>>
        Some common concerns about staging are the following:

        - The stage of a cancer is sometimes confused with the grade of a tumor by new registrars. Terms such as well differentiated and undifferentiated are tumor grades.
        - The rules for each staging scheme must be reviewed for each site and histology. The AJCC staging systems and summary staging systems list the sites and histologies to which specific staging schemes apply.
        - The term microinvasion implies invasion through the basement membrane (an anatomic landmark), indicating that the stage is invasive instead of in-situ.
        - Some cases of cancer are difficult to stage appropriately. Problem situations include the following:
          - Diagnostic tests done on an outpatient basis with results not documented in the hospital health information record
          - Tests and biopsies done in a physician's office and sent to freestanding laboratories for assessment
          - Conflicting information about the exact location, size, and involvement of the tumor


        There are many resources available for staging cancers. The registry should have adequate access to appropriate references. Staging manuals for the most commonly used systems (summary staging, AJCC staging, and SEER extent of disease) provide comprehensive guidelines. These should be routinely reviewed at the time of abstracting to verify the staging classification.

        The Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons requires that staging be done by the managing physician and recorded in the patient's health information record. This requirement does not negate the need for the registrar to understand staging. Verification is necessary at the registry level to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data. It is imperative that staging be correct, when registry data are reported and analyzed.

        The patient's treatment is based on the extent of the disease. The prognosis of the disease can be estimated by the stage and other factors such as age, aggressiveness of tumor, and the presence or absence of other medical conditions. In certain stages of disease, quality of life issues may influence treatment decisions. The stage of disease is used in research studies and in the analysis of cancers.

    / Introduction
    let intro >
      Cancer treatment involves medical procedures to destroy, modify, control, or remove primary, regional, or metastatic cancer tissue. The goals of cancer treatment include eradicating known tumors entirely, preventing the recurrence or spread of the primary cancer, and relieving symptoms if all reasonable curative approaches have been exhausted.

      Decisions concerning how to treat a particular cancer are based on many factors. The primary goal is to choose an approach that will remove the tumor, rid the body of wandering cancer cells, and prevent a recurrence.

      For cancer registrars, it is necessary to distinguish cancer-directed treatment from non-cancer directed treatment, which are recorded differently in cancer data fields.

      Any treatment that is given to modify, control, remove or destroy primary or metastatic cancer tissue is cancer directed treatment. The type of treatment is meant to remove a tumor or minimize the size of tumor or delay the spread of disease.

      Non-cancer directed treatment refers to any treatment designed to prepare the patient for cancer-directed treatment, prolong a patient's life, alleviate pain, or make the patient comfortable. Non-cancer directed treatments are not meant to destroy the tumor, control the tumor, or delay the spread of disease. These treatments include diagnostic tests and supportive care.

      To ensure complete and accurate treatment data, terms such as "first course of treatment" and "treatment for recurrence or progression" should be defined.

      First course of treatment includes all methods of treatment recorded in the treatment plan and administered to the patient before disease progression or recurrence. In cancer treatment data registration, the date of the first course treatment is the month, day, and year of the first cancer-directed treatment that is administered.

      Treatment of recurrence or progression (also called "subsequent treatment") includes all cancer-directed treatments administered after the first course of treatment is completed, stopped, or changed. For the date of "Subsequent Treatment(s) For Recurrence or Progression," the date(s) of treatment(s) administered for progression or recurrence of disease is(are) recorded. In short, subsequent treatment starts after the first course of treatment has been completed, stopped, or changed.

      This learning module provides brief discussions of the common cancer treatment approaches and how the treatment information should be used and coded by a cancer registrar. Cancer registrars will need the SEER Program Code Manual, Third Edition (NIH Publication No. 98-2313) and the CoC's ROADS Manual for the definitions and standard codes to be used in the treatment data fields

        # Introduction to Surgery
        Based on descriptions of discovered Egyptian papyri, surgeries were performed by the ancient Egyptians. The tools they used for surgery included knives, drills, saws, hooks, forceps, and pinchers. Some of these tools, somewhat modified, are still used for surgical purposes today. In contrast with the role played by surgery in the past, surgery is more important now than ever. Surgical technology and techniques are so advanced that surgery is able to accomplish what ancient surgeons never dreamed of. Surgery is used for a great variety of diseases, including cancer treatment. In fact, it is the oldest form of treatment for cancer and until the mid 20th century, surgery was considered the only treatment modality that could cure patients with cancer.

        Cancer surgery attempts to completely remove localized tumors or reduce the size of large tumors so that follow-up treatment by radiation or chemotherapy will be more effective.

        Other than its curative purpose, cancer surgery may be done as a diagnostic ([glossary term:] staging) process or a preventive measure. Surgeries are also performed to relieve pain or repair deformities and abnormalities caused by surgical treatment for cancer.

        Sometimes, surgeries for different purposes may take place simultaneously. For example, curative surgery may be performed right after a diagnostic surgery or a curative surgery may be followed by a reconstructive surgery.

        Generally surgery involves cutting into the body (incision) to explore or remove tissue while the patient is under anesthesia.

        Surgical techniques used for surgery include cryosurgery, electrocauterization surgery, laser surgery, gamma knife, and en bloc resection. These techniques will be discussed in detail later.

      / Review: Surgery
      let review >
        Here is what we have learned from Surgery:

        Any treatment that is given to modify, control, remove or destroy primary or metastatic cancer tissue is considered to be cancer directed treatment. Non-cancer directed treatment refers to any treatment or procudure designed to diagnose or stage the disease, prepare the patient for cancer-directed treatment, prolong a patient's life, alleviate pain, or make the patient comfortable.

        First course of treatment includes all methods of treatment recorded in the treatment plan and administered to the patient before disease progression or recurrence.

        Surgery is the oldest form of treatment for cancer.

        Ancient Egyptians first conducted medical operations with very primitive surgical tools such as knives, drills, saws, hooks, forceps, and pinchers, some of which, modified somewhat, are still used for surgical purpose today.

        New, improved, and more effective surgical tools include laser and radiation (gamma knife).

        Diagnostic surgery involves physically removing a sample of a suspected tumor and examining this material under a microscope so that a definite diagnosis can be made. This procedure is called biopsy.

        Types of biopsies include excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy, endoscopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, bone marrow biopsy, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and core biopsy. Refer to "All About Biopsies (PDF)" for more details.

        Curative surgeries take a much more radical surgical approach, partially or totally removing the organ of origin. In addition to excisional surgeries where more traditional surgical tools such as scalpels are used, modern surgical tools include laser (laser surgery), high-frequency electrical currents (electrosurgery), and radiation (gamma knife), even liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery).

        In preventive surgery, the surgeon removes tissue that does not yet contain cancer cells, but has the probability of becoming cancerous in the future. Oophrectomy (removal of both ovaries) is one of the examples of preventive surgery against ovarian cancer.

        Palliative surgery is performed to make the patient's life as comfortable as possible or to prolong the patient's life when the disease is not responsive to any type of curative treatment.

        Finally, reconstructive surgery may be performed to repair the damage caused by the cancer or the curative surgery as well as to improve functions of certain anatomic parts of the body.

          # Types of Surgery
          This section provides an overview of four types of surgery and details the purpose, benefits and risks.

        / Diagnostic Surgery
        let diagnostic >
          There are many ways to detect or confirm a suspicion of the presence of a cancer. Microscopic examination of [glossary term:] biopsy samples is the ideal way that a positive diagnosis of cancer can be made. This procedure involves physically removing all or part (tissue, cells, or fluid) of a suspected tumor and examining this material under a microscope. The purpose of a biopsy is to identify the histologic type of cancer and possibly stage of disease.

          Any organ in the body can be biopsied utilizing a variety of techniques. Some may require major surgery, while others may not even require local anesthesia. Types of biopsies include [glossary term:] incisional biopsy, [glossary term:] excisional biopsy, [glossary term:] endoscopic biopsy, [glossary term:] colposcopic biopsy, bone marrow biopsy, [glossary term:] fine needle aspiration biopsy, [glossary term:] stereotactic biopsy, and [glossary term:] core biopsy, to name a few. Biopsies typically leave gross tumor in the body.

          A pathologist performs the microscopic examination of the biopsied material. After careful evaluation, a benign or malignant diagnosis can usually be established. A written report prepared by the pathologist is sent to the doctor who treats the cancer patient. This doctor will then make decisions regarding treatment based on the information found in this report.

          Take breast cancer for example: If a breast abnormality is detected with [glossary term:] mammography or physical exam, the patient will typically be referred for additional breast imaging with diagnostic mammography, [glossary term:] ultrasound, or other imaging tests. While all of these methods of diagnosis can help detect a breast abnormality, biopsy followed by pathological (microscopic) analysis is really the only definitive way to determine if cancer is present.

          The method of biopsy chosen will depend on,

          - How suspicious the abnormality appears
          - The size, shape, and location of the abnormality
          - The number of abnormalities present
          - The patient's medical history
          - The patient's preference
          - The training of the physician who is performing the biopsy
          - The breast imaging center or surgical center where the biopsy is performed.

          Side effects and risks of biopsy do exist, depending on the type of biopsy performed and certain biopsy techniques. [glossary term:] Cytology procedures, needle biopsies, and core biopsies, sometimes may not even come up with a positive cancer diagnosis due to inadequate quantities of cells or tissue removed from the patient. In rare cases, an incorrect diagnosis could be made in the situation where the needle misses the tumor and removes only healthy or non-cancerous tissue. As with the case of preventive surgery, patients are strongly encouraged to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different biopsy methods with their physician(s) prior to undergoing the procedure(s).

          A biopsy that removes only a fragment or portion of the tumor, primary or metastatic, is recorded in the abstract as non-cancer-directed treatment.

        / Surgery as a Preventive Measure
        let preventative >
          In a preventive surgery, the surgeon removes tissue that does not yet contain cancer cells, but has the probability of becoming cancerous in the future. This may also be referred to as prophylactic surgery. For example, with the consent of the patient, the surgeon sometimes removes the ovaries of a woman to avoid the risk of ovarian cancer if the person has a very strong family history of ovarian cancer. Based on studies, a woman whose mother or sister had ovarian cancer has a higher than average risk of developing ovarian cancer. The procedure is called prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries).

          Preventive mastectomy is another example of a surgery with a preventive purpose. In the past, the surgeon may have removed the breast tissue but spared the nipple (subcutaneous mastectomy). Total mastectomy (removal of the entire breast and nipple) is considered in an effort to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer. In addition to women who have already had one breast removed due to cancer, preventive mastectomy may also be an option for women with a strong family history of breast cancer, especially if several close relatives developed the disease before age 50. Women in families with hereditary breast cancer who test positive for a known cancer-causing [glossary term:] gene alteration (for example, BRCA1 and BRCA2) may also consider prophylactic mastectomy surgery, as may women who have had lobular carcinoma in situ, a condition that increases their risk of developing breast cancer in the same breast and/or in the opposite breast.

          Those patients who have a congenital or genetic trait that creates a high risk of developing cancer may benefit from preventive surgery. For example, studies have shown that half of the patients with [glossary term:] familial polyposis of the colon, without a preventive colectomy, would develop cancer of the colon by age 40, and all would develop the disease by age 70.

          Pros and cons exist for preventive surgeries. Some patients may not choose preventive mastectomy or oopherectomy due to their concerns about with sexual and reproductive function and self-image, even if the procedure may add years to their life expectancy. Due to unique risk factors for cancer of each individual patient, a preventive surgery does not guarantee the patient will never develop cancer. Therefore, the decision of a preventive surgery should only be considered after a careful discussion between the surgeon and the patient.

        / Curative Surgery
        let curative >
          Surgery plays a vital role in the cancer treatment plan, especially in patients with solid tumors. Surgery is often used to attempt to cure patients whose tumors are localized at the time of the diagnosis. After definite cancer diagnosis, curative surgical operations are conducted to remove or destroy cancerous tissue. Unlike diagnostic surgeries which may remove a small amount of tissue to confirm the existence and the stage of the disease, curative surgeries take a much more radical surgical approach, typically resulting in partial or total removal of the organ of origin.

          In a curative procedure, a certain amount of normal tissue as well as cancerous tissue may be removed to obtain adequate [glossary term:] margins. The purpose is to minimize the risk of any cancer cells being left behind, which may result in a recurrence of the cancer. For the same purpose, the surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes that are adjacent to the tumor.

          Resection of isolated metastases (removal of solitary metastases) may be performed in some cases, especially if there has been a disease-free interval of more than one year after the surgery. Second-look operations are sometimes performed following adjuvant therapies, but they have little effect on the final outcome in the great majority of cancer patients.

          Scalpels or other instruments are used in excisional surgeries to eradicate the malignant tumor. Many types of excisional surgeries exist, each named for the particular area of the body in which they are performed. For example, laryngectomy involves removal of a large tumor of the larynx which may include removing part of the tongue or oropharynx. Similarly, parathyroidectomy refers to a surgery to remove parathyroid glands or tumors.

          In addition to the more traditional surgical instruments such as scalpels, new technologies are employed in cancer curative surgeries depending on such factors as the patient's age and general health condition, location of tumor, and so on.

          Laser surgery uses a powerful beam of light, which can be directed to specific parts of the body, without making a large incision, to destroy cancer cells. Laser also can be used in cancer treatment as well as preventive surgeries. For example, in the digestive system, laser is often used to remove colon polyps, which may later become cancerous. Laser has been used to treat abnormal tissue, carcinoma in situ, and early cancer of the cervix, vagina, and vulva, to name a few. Many woman with breast cancer choose laser as the surgical tool because it is less painful and requires a shorter stay in the hospital.

          Laser, as a tumor removal tool, has several advantages over scalpels. It is more precise and takes less operating time. Healing time is often shortened because laser heat seals blood vessels so there is less bleeding, swelling, and scarring involved in the surgical procedure. The downside of laser surgery is its cost and proper training of the cancer surgeons. The equipment can be bulky and technologically complicated compared with the more traditional surgical tools such as scalpels.

          Working on a similar biological principle, electrosurgery uses high-frequency electrical currents to cut and destroy cancer cells. In electrosurgery, the high density of the radio-frequency current applied by the active electrosurgical electrode causes a cutting action, which can act like a fine micro-needle, a lancet, a knife, a snare, or even an energized scalpel or scissors.

          Another innovative surgical technique to remove cancer is cryosurgery. Liquid nitrogen, or a probe that is very cold, is used to freeze and kill cancer cells. Traditionally, it has been used to treat external tumors, but now the technique is being employed as a treatment for tumors that occur internally.

          Similar to laser, cryosurgery, incurs minimal blood loss, little discomfort, and shorter recovery time and shorter hospital stays. While researchers are still studying the effectiveness of cryosurgery as a treatment for other types of cancer, the technique has been used successfully in treating prostate cancer. Just as with the laser techniques, cryosurgery has proven to be effective in preventive surgeries. For example, pre-cancerous skin growths known as actinic keratosis and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia can be treated succesfully with cryosurgery.

          According to cancer specialists, the stage of the cancer plays an important role in opting for cryosurgery as a cancer surgical tool. Cryosurgery is most effective for younger patients whose disease is contained entirely within the prostate.

          One frequently asked question is: "Can the surgeon cure the cancer after the surgery?" Unfortunately, there is not a definite answer to this question. In many cases, cancer cells can break away from the primary tumor site and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body by the time of the diagnosis. These patients may not only receive surgery, but may also receive adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy to destroy the metastases.

          The decision of a curative surgery is often made based on such factors as the patient's age and general health condition, location of tumor, stage of tumor, presence or absence of enlarged nodes, and the patient's desire for preservation.

          Each of the surgical procedures described above is recorded in the abstract as cancer-directed treatment.

        / Palliative and Reconstructive Surgeries
        let palliative >
          In addition to diagnostic, curative, and preventive surgeries, surgical procedures are also performed to improve the patient's quality of life. They can restore the function or appearance of organs or tissues that were either removed or changed by cancer treatment.

          ## Palliative Surgery
          Cancer causes pain to most cancer patients as does the treatment. It is estimated that 80% of cancer patients have two or more episodes of pain. More patients experience pain with advanced disease. The quality of life of those patients in great pain, resulting from either the disease or the treatment, is greatly compromised. Under such circumstances, palliative surgery may be performed. For example, the procedure may involve the removal of a painful primary or metastatic tumor mass such as a solitary spinal metastasis.

          The purpose of [glossary term:] palliative surgery is mainly to reduce pain for the patient. The surgery may not necessarily aim to eradicate cancer tissue in the patient. In fact, palliative surgery is often deemed as worthwhile and feasible by cancer specialists when the disease is not responsive to any type of curative treatment. A successful palliative surgery may not only make the patient's life more comfortable, but it may also prolong the cancer patient's life in some cases. Palliative surgery which removes cancer tissue is recorded as cancer-directed surgery. Palliative surgery such as a nerve block procedure to interrupt pain signals in the nervous system, or a stent placement to alleviate obstruction, etc., which does not remove cancer tissue is not recorded as cancer-directed surgery. Palliative procedures are recorded as non-cancer directed surgery.

          ## Reconstructive Surgery
          Reconstructive surgeries are performed on patients with physical deformities and abnormalities caused by traumatic injuries, birth defects, developmental abnormalities, or disease.

          The goals of reconstructive surgery differ from those of cosmetic surgery; while cosmetic surgery is performed to reshape normal structures of the body to improve the patient's appearance and self-esteem, reconstructive surgery is performed on abnormal or damaged structures of the body. In many cases, the reason for the surgery is to repair the damage caused by the curative surgery, as well as to improve functions of certain anatomic parts of the body. In cancer treatment, if curative surgical procedures cause any disfigurement, dysfunction, or deformity, reconstructive surgery may be necessary. Breast reconstruction following surgical treatment for breast cancer is perhaps the most common example of reconstructive surgery.

          For many simple or modified radical mastectomy patients, breast reconstruction may be possible during the same surgical procedure. In this type of reconstructive surgery, additional surgery is avoided and patients do not wake up to the "shock" of losing a breast. While a mastectomy is performed by the cancer surgeon, reconstructive surgery is usually performed by the plastic surgeon. Breast reconstruction may interfere with adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In these cases, reconstructive surgery may be delayed.

          Sometimes, a one-stage reconstruction may not be enough; multiple stages may be necessary for optimal results when delayed tissue transfer is required. As with all other types of surgeries in cancer treatment, careful discussions between cancer patients and their doctors and plastic surgeons are encouraged so that the decisions regarding cancer surgery and reconstructive surgery can be made in the best interest of the patient.

          Reconstructive surgery is recorded in the "Reconstructive/Restoration" data field.

      / Approaches of Surgery
      let approaches >
        ## Open Surgery
        An "open" surgery is one in which the patient is cut open. A typical open surgery involves the use of a scalpel (see scalpel) to make an incision into the skin and cut through the various layers of the dermis and sub-dermal layers and tissues to get to the desired tissue or organ. Some open surgeries use a laser to make the incision (see laser).

        ## Endoscopic Surgery
        Endoscopy is a surgical technique that involves the use of an endoscope, a special viewing instrument that allows a surgeon to see images of the body's internal structures through very small incisions.

        Endoscopic surgery has been used for decades in a number of different procedures, including gallbladder removal, tubal ligation, and knee surgery.

        ### The endoscope
        An endoscope consists of two basic parts: A tubular probe fitted with a tiny camera and bright light, which is inserted through a small incision; and a viewing screen, which magnifies the transmitted images of the body's internal structures. During surgery, the surgeon watches the screen while moving the tube of the endoscope through the surgical area.

        It's important to understand that the endoscope functions as a viewing device only. To perform the surgery, a separate surgical instrument--such as a scalpel, scissors, or forceps--must be inserted through a different point of entry and manipulated within the tissue.

        ### Advantages of endoscopy
        All surgery carries risks and every incision leaves a scar. However, with endoscopic surgery, scars are likely to be much smaller and some of the after effects of surgery may be minimized.

        In a typical endoscopic procedure, only a few small incisions, each less than one inch long, are needed to insert the endoscope probe and other instruments. For some procedures, such as breast augmentation, only two incisions may be necessary. For others, such as a forehead lift, three or more short incisions may be needed. The tiny "eye" of the endoscope's camera allows a surgeon to view the surgical site almost as clearly as if the skin were opened from a long incision.

        Because the incisions are shorter with endoscopy, the risk of sensory loss from nerve damage is decreased. Also, bleeding, bruising and swelling may be significantly reduced. With the endoscopic approach, recovery may be quicker than that of an open surgery.

        Endoscopic surgery may also allow you to avoid an overnight hospital stay. Many endoscopic procedures can be performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia with sedation. Patients should discuss this possibility with their doctor.

      / Surgical Techniques
      let techniques >
        ## Scalpel
        The scalpel is the traditional cancer surgery tool. Other tools such as needles, forceps, or scissors are involved in cancer diagnostic surgeries. However, these traditional cancer surgery tools are being replaced by new and more effective cancer surgical tools such as laser and radiation. These new surgical tools often result in less operative time, cause less pain to cancer patients, and reduce complications, such as scarring that sometimes occur with surgeries performed with traditional surgical tools.

        A recent innovative cancer surgery tool, "Smart Scalpel," still in development, can even detect cancer cells. "Smart Scalpel," a dime-sized biological laser, can quickly identify a cell population that has abnormal protein content (as cancer cells usually do). This device should assist surgeons in cutting away malignant tissue while minimizing the amount of healthy tissue removed.

        ## Cryosurgery
        Cryosurgery (also called cryotherapy) is the use of extreme cold to destroy cancer cells. Traditionally, it has been used to treat external tumors, such as those on the skin, but recently some physicians have begun using it as a treatment for tumors that occur inside the body. Cryosurgery for internal tumors is increasing in popularity as a result of developments in technology over the past several years.

        For external tumors, liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees Celsius, -320.8 degrees Fahrenheit) is applied directly to the cancer cells or tissue with a cotton swab or spraying device. For internal tumors, liquid nitrogen is circulated through an instrument called a cryoprobe, which is placed in contact with the tumor. To guide the cryoprobe and to monitor the freezing of the cells, the physician uses ultrasound (computerized moving pictures of the body generated by high-frequency sound waves). By using ultrasound, physicians hope to spare nearby healthy tissue.

        Cryosurgery often involves a cycle of treatments in which the tumor is frozen, allowed to thaw, and then refrozen.

        Advantages of Cryosurgery:
        - Minimally invasive--no blood loss, no surgical incision, and can be done as an outpatient.
        - Favorable success rates and less complications--less complications than open surgery.
        - Short recuperation period.
        - Procedure can be repeated if the first cryosurgery has failed.
        - Radiation therapy or radical surgery is still an option if the cryosurgery fails.
        - Cost is less than traditional treatment.

        ## Electrocauterization Surgery
        Cauterization is the process of destroying tissue by using chemical corrosion, electricity, or heat. Electrocautery is done using a small probe, which has an electric current running through it, to cauterize (burn or destroy) the tissue.

        Electrocautery is a safe procedure and is routinely used in surgery to burn unwanted or harmful tissue. It is also effectively used to reduce or stop hemorrhaging by "burning" the bleeding blood vessels (seals them off). Various types, shapes, and sizes of tips (probes) are available for specific treatments.

        A specific type of electrocautery is fulguration, sometimes called electrodesiccation. Electrodesiccation is the destruction of tissue with a diathermy instrument. Electrodesiccation is particularly useful inside the bladder. Bladder electrodesiccation is performed via the urethra and viewed through a cystoscope.

        ## Laser Surgery
        L-A-S-E-R stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Through a complicated electronic process, a beam of light is produced which has special properties. This light is all one wavelength; that is, it is all one color of the spectrum. The light is focused so that all of its rays are traveling in the same direction. In a similar fashion, you might use the lens of a magnifying glass to focus rays of sunlight to a point.

        Lasers are used for many reasons. In many instances, lasers can improve the precision of the surgeon with finely focused beams of light. Some lasers can reduce bleeding by coagulating blood vessels as they cut tissue. Others can be aimed down narrow passages or sent down fiber-optic channels in endoscopes to reach areas that are otherwise inaccessible.

        A new trend in laser surgery is to use the special properties of different wavelengths of laser light to selectively treat different problems. For instance, a yellow laser light absorbed by the red blood cells of a birthmark called a "portwine stain" can result in the selective destruction of the birthmark without affecting the skin cells around it. The result is that scarring of the remaining normal skin is lessened or avoided. In another instance of selective laser treatment, drugs that are retained by tumors are infused into the body and activated by lasers to destroy only the tumor, preserving normal structures.

        In many instances, the cost of medical care can be reduced by lasers. Through their use, many procedures that previously required hospital admission can be done on an outpatient basis.

        ## Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
        PDT is a revolutionary medical technology that uses lasers to activate light-sensitive pharmaceuticals to treat cancer (and other diseases) in a minimally-invasive manner.

        PDT is considered to be cancer-directed surgery, and there are specific codes in the surgery data fields for PDT of various primary sites.

        PDT works as follows:

        1. The patient is injected intravenously with a light-sensitive drug (most often, "photofrin").
        2. The drug is retained by malignant tissue, remaining inactive until exposed to a specific wavelength of laser light.
        3. Laser energy is directed to the site through a flexible fiberoptic device that allows the laser to be targeted precisely at the site.
        4. When activated by the lasers' light energy, the drug creates a toxic form of oxygen that destroys the cancerous cells with minimal damage to surrounding healthy cells.

        ## En Bloc Resection
        An en bloc resection is a surgical procedure in which a lesion and surrounding tissues are removed. "En bloc" or "in continuity with" means that all of the tissues were removed during the same procedure, but not necessarily in a single specimen.

    / Radiation Therapy
    space radiation
      >>>
        X-rays, a form of invisible, high-energy radiation, was discovered by German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen. X-rays have been used to both diagnose and treat diseases. X-rays can penetrate through many objects, forming images covered by other objects. This is the principle on which x-ray imaging of the body for medical diagnostic purpose is based. It was later discovered that x-rays can kill cancerous cells and shrink tumors because of the high energy emission. This method of treatment is called radiation therapy.

        Radiation therapy uses x-rays, [glossary term:] gamma rays and other sources of radiation to destroy cancer cells. Radiation kills cells by breaking up [glossary term:] molecules and causing reactions that damage living cells. Sometimes the cells are destroyed immediately; sometimes certain components of cells, such as their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), are damaged, thereby affecting the ability of the cell to divide.

        The radiation treatment is usually given using sophisticated equipment which produces a beam of high energy x-rays. The patient lies on a bed under the machine and the beam is directed at the site of the cancer. Due to the advancement of technologies, newly developed machines are able to produce radiation beams of much greater energy while maintaining pinpoint accuracy. Therefore, severe skin damage during treatment, which was common in the early days of radiation therapy treatment, is very rare with modern techniques.

        Since emitted radiation energy does not distinguish between cancer cells and normal tissue, radiation fields are very carefully planned, during the process of radiation treatment, to protect uninvolved tissue and vital organs of the patient. Certain predictable side effects may occur after radiation treatment, with fatigue being the most common one. However, most side effects are temporary and easily treated.

        Two main types of radiation treatment exist: external beam radiation, known as teletherapy, and internal therapy, or brachytheraphy. External beam radiation directs radiation from a remote source aimed at the body while with internal therapy a radioactive source is placed inside the body close to cancer cells or the tumor mass.

        The goal of radiation therapy can be curative or palliative. Radiation therapy is frequently used as adjuvant therapy to other treatments, most often with surgery and chemotherapy.

      / Curative Radiation Therapy
      let curative >
        ## Curative Radiation Therapy
        Radiation therapy plays a very important role in cancer treatment, using radiation to kill cancer cells and while causing minimal damage to normal cells and tissue. More than half of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy.

        The decision to treat a tumor with radiation is based on the location of the primary tumor and whether the tumor cells are radiosensitive. Although radiation therapy and surgery have similar cure rates for some types of cancer, radiation therapy is preferred to surgery if the patient has a preexisting condition that makes surgery impossible or if surgery would require removing part or all of an organ. For example, radiation therapy may be chosen to treat cancer of the larynx in order to preserve the voice.

        Radiosensitive tumors respond by promptly showing regression after moderate doses of radiation. Two examples of highly radiosensitive cancers are leukemia (cancer of the blood cells) and lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system).

        Radiation therapy is most effective when a tumor is contained, easily accessible, and located away from major organs of the body. Testicular cancer, for example, is one of the best candidates for radiation therapy. During the process of radiation therapy for testicular cancer, the rest of the body can be easily protected from the radiation. Radiation can be directed from all angles to increase the effectiveness of the treatment.

        Radiocurability means that the normal tissue-tumor relationship is such that curative doses of radiation can be used without excessively damaging the normal tissue. Radiocurative tumors include carcinoma of the cervix, larynx, breast, and prostate. Radiation may be the only therapy necessary for radiocurative tumors.

        Generally, radiation is directed to the tumor and the immediate surrounding area. This destroys the main tumor and any nearby tumor spread. Higher total doses of radiation are needed to destroy the main tumor; lower doses are given to destroy the spread of the tumor. Because radiation affects both normal and cancerous cells, radiation fields are very carefully planned (by radiation therapists and physicists) to exclude uninvolved vital organs and tissues. Patients are treated with multiple small doses of radiation with time in between treatments so their healthy cells can repair much of the radiation damage.

        The doctor in charge of the patient's radiation therapy is called a radiation oncologist, who develops and prescribes each cancer patient's radiation treatment plan and makes sure that every treatment is accurately given. The radiation oncologist works closely with other physicians and all members of the radiation oncology team, who are trained in the safe use of radiation, to make sure the cancer patient gets the best possible treatment.

        ## Palliative Radiation Therapy
        In addition to its curative purposes, radiation therapy may also be given to relieve pain in cancer patients. For example, radiation therapy can often relieve the pain caused by secondary bone cancer despite the uncertainty about how it works. For palliative purposes, lower doses are given than for curative treatment, usually over a shorter period of time.

        ## Adjuvant Treatment
        In order to achieve the most effective cancer curative results, radiation treatment is frequently used as adjuvant therapy to other treatments. Radiation treatment may be administered before or after surgical treatment. Sometimes, surgery may effectively remove the gross tumor, but there may be a limit to the amount of adjacent tissue that can be removed without impairing function. Post-surgery radiation treatment can be administered to destroy microscopic residual cancer cells left after surgery. Sometimes, pre-surgery radiation treatment is administered to shrink the tumor so that it can be surgically removed more easily or make the operation less radical, thereby preserving more normal tissue. Based on studies, better cancer treatment outcomes result after the combination of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy after surgery.

        To ensure the success of radiation treatment, the radiation oncologist tailors each patient's treatment to make sure it is safe and effective. A careful treatment plan is often made, and then practiced using a simulator before any actual treatment begins.

      / Types of Radiation Therapy
      let types >
        There are two main types of radiation therapy: external beam radiation (teletherapy) and internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy).

        ## External Beam Radiation Therapy (Teletherapy)
        External beam radiation therapy is radiation delivered from a distant source, from outside the body and directed at the patient's cancer site. Systems which produce different types of radiation for external beam therapy include orthovoltage x-ray machines, Cobalt-60 machines, linear accelerators, [glossary term:] proton beam machines, and [glossary term:] neutron beam machines. A radiation oncologist makes decisions regarding the type of system that is best suited to treat a specific cancer patient. External beam therapy is the radiation therapy treatment option used for most cancer patients. It is used to treat many types of tumors including cancers of the head and neck area, breast, lung, colon, and prostate.

        Depending upon tumor location, different levels of radiation are used for external beam therapy. Low-energy radiation does not penetrate very deeply into the body and is used mainly to treat surface tumors such as skin cancer. High-energy radiation is used to treat other deeper cancers.

        Stereotactic radiation therapy involves focusing the radiation beam on a small area and delivering very high doses. The therapy targets a tumor from many different directions so the beams of radiation converge on the tumor. This way, the ideal amount of radiation needed to destroy tumor cells is delivered directly to the tumor growth, while the amount of exposure to the area surrounding the tumor is minimized. Stereotactic radiation therapy is very effective in treating small tumors such as those in the head and brain.

        External beam therapy is painless. Most patients do not need to stay in the hospital while they are having external beam therapy. Patients do not see or feel the actual treatment. Many patients can go home following each treatment, and most patients can even continue with their normal daily activities. Sources of external beam radiation may include, but are not limited to: X-ray, cobalt, linear accelerator, neutron beam, betatron, spray radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery such as gamma knife, and proton beam.

        ### Gamma Knife
        Developed in 1968 by Swedish professors Lars Leksell and Borge Larsson, the gamma knife (sometimes called the "Leksell-Larsson Gamma Knife") is a highly advanced instrument used to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVM), facial pain, benign and malignant brain tumors, and other functional brain disorders. What makes the gamma knife so unique is that it successfully treats these conditions with no incision. Instead, it uses a concentrated radiation dose from Cobalt-60 sources. A total of 201 beams of radiation intersect to form a powerful tool focused on a targeted area of abnormal tissue within the brain. Amazingly, the gamma knife is so precise that it damages and destroys the unhealthy tissue while sparing adjacent normal, healthy tissue.

        ## Internal Radiation Therapy (Brachytherapy)
        Brachytherapy involves placing radiation sources as close as possible to the tumor site. Sometimes, they may be inserted directly into the tumor. The radioactive sources or isotopes are in the form of wires, seeds (or molds), or rods. This technique is particularly effective in treating cancers of the cervix, uterus, vagina, rectum, eye, and certain head and neck cancers. It is also occasionally used to treat cancers of the breast, brain, skin, anus, esophagus, lung, bladder, and prostate.

        In some instances, brachytherapy may be used in conjunction with external beam therapy. When both forms are employed, the external beam radiation is intended to destroy cancerous cells in a large area surrounding the tumor, while the brachytherapy delivers a boost, or higher dose of radiation, to help destroy the main concentrated mass of tumor cells.

        There are several types of brachytherapy characterized by different methods of placing radiation inside the body: interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraluminal radiation therapy, and radioactively tagged molecules given intravenously.

        Interstitial brachytherapy involves implanting radioactive needles or wires in the tumor area. The radioactive sources may be put in and taken out on the same day; removed from the body after several days; or may stay in the patient permanently.
        With intracavitary brachytherapy, a radiation oncologist places radioactive sources, using a metal or plastic device (applicator), in body cavities such as the vagina, uterus, or larynx to irradiate the walls of the cavity or nearby tissues. Usually the radioactive source is afterloaded into the applicator. When the specified dose of radiation has been delivered to the tumor, the physician removes the applicator containing the radioactive isotope.

        Intraluminal radiation therapy delivers radiation to hollow organs. For example, a surgeon or a radiation oncologist inserts a specially designed tube or applicator into the lumen, or opening, of the esophagus to treat cancer.

        Finally, radioactive particles can be attached to small molecules and given intravenously. For example, I-131 is used intravenously to treat bony metastases.

      / Possible Side Effects
      let sideeffects >
        Despite the great efforts that are made to protect normal tissue during the administration of radiation treatment, some contact is unavoidable and side effects often occur. Some side effects are general while others affect only the area being treated. Knowing these side effects, cancer patients will find themselves better prepared and may find it easier to cope with them.

        Most cancer patients receiving radiation therapy report feeling "tired" during the radiation treatment. The experience of fatigue may not be severe enough to interrupt their daily activities, but it usually increases gradually during the course of radiation treatment. It may take weeks or even months to vanish after completion of the radiation treatment. Patients are advised to rest as much as possible during radiation treatment.

        Another common side effect during radiation treatment is [glossary term:] nausea, and possibly vomiting. This kind of reaction to radiation therapy is more likely when large areas are being treated or when the treatment covers the upper part of the abdomen. Any nausea caused by the treatment can usually be relieved by taking a mild anti-nausea tablet. Many cancer patients lose their appetite while suffering from nausea. As with all treatment for cancer, patients are encouraged to keep up a healthy diet and drink plenty of fluids.

        Occasionally, mild depression can develop in some cancer patients as a result of radiation therapy. Under such circumstances, support groups or professional advice can be of great help.

        In addition to the general side effects mentioned above, some symptoms are responses of the organ or structure receiving radiation treatment. For example, hair loss can be caused by radiation therapy given to the head. Reactions such as swallowing difficulty and shortness of breath can be caused by the radiation treatment applied to the chest area.

        Side effects that occur with any one type of radiation treatment may be different from person to person. Cancer patients who have identical courses of treatment may have different side effects and the severity of their side effects may also vary. Some people may go through their entire course of treatment with almost no side effects. Due to the improvement of modern day radiation therapy machines, side effects brought on by radiation treatment have become much less severe.

        The radiation oncologist is the best person to advise the patient if side effects occur. Patients should talk with their doctor about any symptoms they are experiencing. The doctor can give the patient information, or prescribe medicines, that can help relieve some of the side effects caused by the radiation therapy.

        Although there is increasing concern about the dangers of radiation and the possible side effects of the treatment, with continued improvement of the technology and the experience of doctors in properly using the machines, the risks of radiation treatment are becoming much smaller and are greatly outweighed by the benefits.

      / Review: Radiation Therapy
      let review >
        Two major types of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy delivers radiation from a source at a distance from the body and is directed at the cancer site. Internal radiation therapy places radiation sources as close as possible to the tumor site. There are several sub-categories of internal radiation therapies based on the way radiation is placed inside the body: interstitial, intracavitary, intraluminal, and intravenously.

        Radiation therapy is often used when surgery is impossible or part or all of an organ would be removed if curative surgery were performed. Radiation therapy is most effective on radiosensitive cells.

        As an adjuvant therapy, radiation therapy is used to destroy microscopic cancer cells before and after other therapies. Lower doses of radiation are given to cancer patients for palliative purposes, most often given to bony metastases.

        Common side effects of radiation therapy are fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and depression.

    / Chemotherapy
    space chemo
      >>>
        Chemotherapy as a cancer treatment can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians, who used compounds of barley, pigs' ears, and other ingredients to treat cancers of the stomach and the uterus.

        During World War II, it was found that soldiers who were exposed to sulfur mustard suffered from lower white blood cell counts. This discovery led to the use of nitrogen mustard, a similar but less toxic chemical agent, to cure patients with high white blood cells counts (lymphoid leukemia) and lymphomas. Later, more chemical substances were studied and tested, becoming chemotherapeutical drugs for cancer treatment.

        Chemotherapy is a distinctively different approach than surgery and radiation therapy to treat cancer. Rather than physically removing a tumor or a part of it, chemotherapy uses chemical agents (anti-cancer or cytotoxic drugs) to interact with cancer cells to eradicate or control the growth of cancer.

        Cells divide by going through a cell cycle, following an ordered set of events that include the synthesis of [glossary term:] DNA (S-phase), [glossary term:] mitosis (M-phase), culminating in cell growth and division into two daughter cells. Normal cells grow and die in a precisely controlled way while cancer occurs when the process becomes abnormal, with cells dividing and forming more cells without control and order.

        In chemotherapy, drugs that interfere primarily with DNA synthesis and mitosis (the S and M phases of the cell cycle) are used to destroy cancer cells. Different agents work through many different mechanisms: some damage a cell's genetic material (DNA); some prevent the cell from dividing.
        Since chemotherapeutic drugs cannot distinguish between normal cells and cancer cells, both types of cells are affected by chemotherapy. Toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents to normal cells is the cause of unpleasant side effects. However, the value of chemotherapy lies in the fact that the killing effect of chemotherapeutic agents has a definite selectivity for cancer cells over normal host cells. Normal tissues are able to repair themselves and continue to grow, so the injury caused by chemotherapy is rarely permanent.

      / Chemotherapy
      let chemo >
        Chemotherapy is a systemic method of cancer treatment, in contrast with local therapies such as surgery and radiation therapy. The drugs used in chemotherapy are able to reach most parts of the body. Therefore, chemotherapy is likely to be recommended for cancer that has already spread to other areas of the body, for tumors that occur at more than one site, or for tumors that cannot be removed surgically. It is also used when a patient has recurrent disease after initial treatment with surgery or radiation therapy.

        Chemotherapy is less mutilating than surgery and helps conserve organ or limb function since anti-cancer drugs are used to act on cancer cells without direct removal of a body part.

        For some cancers, chemotherapy alone can destroy all the cancer cells and cure the cancer (primary treatment). As an adjuvant treatment, chemotherapy is given prior to, or after other methods, to increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment. Most often, adjuvant chemotherapy is given after other therapies have destroyed the clinically detectable cancer cells. The purpose of adjuvant chemotherapy is to reduce the risk of recurrence or to prolong survival. If cure is not possible, chemotherapy may be given to minimize the discomfort caused by cancer or slow the progression of the disease to prolong the patient's life (palliative treatment).

        As a primary treatment, chemotherapy is used for some cancers such as [glossary term:] Hodgkin's disease, [glossary term:] leukemia, [glossary term:] Burkitt's lymphoma, localized diffuse large cell lymphoma, [glossary term:] Wilms' tumor, small cell lung cancer, and testicular cancer.

        Chemotherapy may be given prior to surgical resection or radiation therapy to shrink the tumor and make it easier to resect. This type of chemotherapy is called neo-adjuvant, induction, or preoperative chemotherapy.

        As a palliative therapy, chemotherapy can be used to help make the cancer patient's life as comfortable as possible. In the case of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, which is generally considered incurable, chemotherapy is administered to relieve symptoms and serious complications such as anemia.

        Every cancer is unique, as is every cancer patient; therefore, the oncologist takes great care to tailor the chemotherapy plan to the particular case. The treatment protocol specifies what type of drug(s) should be given, what dosage should be given, how to administer the drug(s), how often the drug(s) should be given, and how long the treatment should last. During chemotherapy, the oncologist, who may change or modify the treatment plan to achieve better results, closely monitors the progress of the cancer patient and the tumor response.

      / Types of Chemotherapy Drugs
      let types >
        Just like scalpels, lasers, and electric currents are used in surgery, the weapons used to fight cancer in chemotherapy are a host of anti-cancer drugs. How differently these drugs kill cancer cells, or prevent them from dividing, depends on their classification. Drugs in the same class kill cancer cells by the same mechanism: they all attack the same target within the cell.

        Depending on the type of cancer and the kind of drug used, chemotherapy drugs may be administered differently. They can be administered orally (oral chemotherapy), or injected into a muscle (intramuscular injection), injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection), or into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy). In special cases, chemotherapy drugs may be injected into the fluid around the spine (intrathecal chemotherapy). Two or more methods of administration may be used at the same time under certain circumstances. No matter what method is used, chemotherapy drugs are absorbed into the blood and carried around the body.

        Of all the methods of chemotherapy drug administration mentioned above, intravenous injection is most commonly used. It is the most efficient way to get the medication into the bloodstream. Oral chemotherapy is more convenient and does not require any specialized equipment.

        In chemotherapy, cancer patients may be given one or several drugs from the available anti-cancer drugs. Since different chemical agents damage cancer cells in different ways and at different phases in the cell cycle, a combination of drugs is often employed to increase the cancerous cell-killing effectiveness. This is called combination chemotherapy.

        Listed below are several major categories (classes) of chemotherapy agents based on their chemical structures and the way they act on cancer cells:

        ## Alkylating agents
        Alkylating agents were among the first anti-cancer drugs and are the most commonly used agents in chemotherapy today. Alkylating agents act directly on DNA, causing cross-linking of DNA strands, abnormal base pairing, or DNA strand breaks, thus preventing the cell from dividing. Alkylating agents are generally considered to be cell cycle phase nonspecific, meaning that they kill the cell in various and multiple phases of the cell cycle. Although alkylating agents may be used for most types of cancer, they are generally of greatest value in treating slow-growing cancers. Alkylating agents are not as effective on rapidly growing cells. Examples of alkylating agents include chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and busulfan.

        ## Antimetabolites
        Antimetabolites replace natural substances as building blocks in DNA molecules, thereby altering the function of enzymes required for cell metabolism and protein synthesis. In other words, they mimic nutrients that the cell needs to grow, tricking the cell into consuming them, so it eventually starves to death.

        Antimetabolites are cell cycle specific. Antimetabolites are most effective during the S-phase of cell division because they primarily act upon cells undergoing synthesis of new DNA for formation of new cells. The toxicities associated with these drugs are seen in cells that are growing and dividing quickly. Examples of antimetabolites include purine antagonists, pyrimidine antagonists, and folate antagonists.

        ## Plant alkaloids
        Plant alkaloids are antitumor agents derived from plants. These drugs act specifically by blocking the ability of a cancer cell to divide and become two cells. Although they act throughout the cell cycle, some are more effective during the S- and M- phases, making these drugs cell cycle specific. Examples of plant alkaloids used in chemotherapy are actinomycin D, doxorubicin, and mitomycin.

        ## Antitumor antibiotic
        Antitumor antibiotics are cell cycle nonspecific. They act by binding with DNA and preventing RNA (ribonucleic acid) synthesis, a key step in the creation of proteins, which are necessary for cell survival. They are not the same as antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. Rather, these drugs cause the strands of genetic material that make up DNA to uncoil, thereby preventing the cell from reproducing. Doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and bleomycin are some examples of antitumor antibiotics.

        One of the most important decisions for the oncologist is prescribing the right amount of anti-cancer drugs. Although large doses will kill more cells, greater amounts of drugs will produce more severe side effects. However, lowering the dosage to minimize side effects will also reduce the chances of success. The usual practice is to use the maximum safe dose for effectiveness, even at the cost of temporary side effects. The following section will discuss some common side effects caused by anti-cancer drugs and ways to cope with them.

      / Possible Side Effects
      let sideeffects >
        The known side effects of chemotherapy are caused by the cell killing effect of anti-cancer drugs. Chemotherapy drugs act on normal cells as well as cancer cells. Cancer cells typically grow and divide more rapidly than normal cells. The fast-growing normal cells most likely to be affected by chemotherapy are blood cells forming in the bone marrow, and cells in the digestive tract, reproductive system, and hair follicles. Common side effects of chemotherapy include fatigue, nausea, [glossary term:] diarrhea, mouth sores, hair loss, and [glossary term:] anemia.

        Bone marrow produces several types of blood cells essential to health. Because these cells are constantly dividing, they are vulnerable to the effects of chemotherapy. Blood cell precursors produce three important blood components: red blood cells (which carry oxygen throughout the body); white blood cells (which fight infection); and platelets (which help blood clot and stop bleeding). A drop in the levels of any of these blood cell counts results in specific side effects.

        Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy. It may be the result of anemia (a decrease in oxygen-carrying red blood cells), which causes a feeling of lethargy, dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath. Fatigue may also be a result of a lot of energy being used by the body to recover from the effects of the drugs, disposing of dead cells and building new cells. Other factors, such as pain, poor appetite, lack of rest, and emotional stress may also contribute to a patient's fatigue.

        Some common signs of infection, such as fever, sore throat, and wounds that do not heal or become inflamed, may be experienced by cancer patients because the body's capability to fight infection is greatly compromised due to the lowered number of white blood cells.

        [glossary term:] Platelets are important for wound healing and blood clotting. With a low platelet count caused by chemotherapy, the cancer patient is at risk of bruising and bleeding easily. Such side effects as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stool, and unusually heavy menstrual flow, may be experienced by the patient receiving chemotherapy.

        Nausea and vomiting occur when certain drugs stimulate an area of the brain called the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Overeating, motion sickness, or anxiety can also activate this zone. The effects of some drugs on the fast growing cells in the lining of the stomach may also cause nausea and vomiting.

        Diarrhea may be caused from direct damage of the lining of the intestines by some anti-cancer drugs. Anti-nausea drugs may also cause diarrhea.

        Hair loss can be extremely devastating to the patient. When some anti-cancer drugs kill cancer cells, they also kill fast-growing normal cells such as those in hair follicles, causing alopecia (hair loss).

        As with other cancer therapies, changes in mood and emotions occur to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Feelings of loss of control, missing normal daily activities, and fear of the unknown, coupled with the side effects brought about by chemotherapy, can take a toll on the patient's mental well-being. Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy may feel angry, depressed, anxious, afraid, confused, forgetful, and agitated.

        Factors such as the type of drug, the amount of drug, and the condition of the cancer patient receiving chemotherapy may determine the kind and the degree of side effects that a cancer patient experiences. Each patient reacts to chemotherapy in a unique way. Some people have very few side effects, while others may experience more. For example, while some patients may experience very unpleasant nausea and vomiting, other patients may not have any treatment-related nausea and vomiting. Similarly, some patients may feel mild lethargy resulting from chemotherapy, but some patients may feel completely worn out.

        To cope with all of the possible side effects brought about by chemotherapy, the cancer patient needs to be well-informed: knowing what to expect helps the patient to be prepared to handle any side-effects that may show up. The doctor has advice on how the patient may alter their lifestyle or eating habits to make some side effects more tolerable. Medication may also be prescribed to overcome certain side effects. Since normal cells usually recover when the chemotherapy is over, most side effects should gradually go away once the chemotherapy has ended.

      / Review: Chemotherapy
      let review >
        From a historical view, we learned that the Egyptians were the first to use chemotherapy, and that serious investigation of chemotherapy started with the observation of some unusual reactions of soldiers exposed to some chemicals used in World War II.

        We learned that all cells, healthy and malignant, go through distinct phases in their life cycle. This is called the cell cycle. Chemotherapy drugs are designed to disrupt a cell's function at one or all of these phases. It is also important to know that normal cells, as well as cancer cells, are affected by chemotherapy, and the cause of unpleasant side effects is toxicity of the drugs to normal cells.

        Chemotherapy can be used for curative and palliative purposes and it is often given after other therapies (such as surgery or radiation) have destroyed the clinically detectable cancer cells (adjuvant chemotherapy).

        In the discussion of chemotherapy drugs, we learned that there are different ways that chemotherapeutic agents are administered: oral chemotherapy; intravenous chemotherapy; and intrathecal chemotherapy.

        In addition, the major categories of chemotherapy agents were described: alkylating agents; antimetabolites; plant alkaloids; and anti-tumor antibiotics.

        Finally, some side effects caused by chemotherapy include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, hair loss, and changes in mood and emotions.

    / Hormonal Therapy
    space hormone
      >>>
        Hormones are natural substances produced by the body that control reproduction, growth, and [glossary term:] metabolism.

        Certain body tissues, such as breast and prostate, require hormones to develop. When cancer originates in these tissues, it responds to hormones. This means that the cancer responds to hormonal manipulation, which includes the administration of hormones, the withdrawal of hormones, or interference with hormone function. For example, by using chemicals that block the action of these hormones, it is possible to slow down, or even stop, the growth of cancer cells.

        Rarely given as a single agent to attempt to cure cancer, hormones are often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other modalities of treatment have removed the gross primary tumor and chemotherapy or radiation therapy have treated systemic and regional micrometastases.

        An example is a breast cancer patient who had the primary tumor and positive axillary nodes removed surgically, received systemic chemotherapy and regional radiation, and was placed on tamoxifen, a synthetic antiestrogen, to prevent or delay recurrence.

        Hormones can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly. Surgery may also be used to prevent the body from producing hormones. For example, a patient with prostate cancer may have an orchiectomy to prevent the production of testosterone.

        Some types of cancer may originate from organs that require hormones to develop, but they may not be treated with hormonal therapy. A sample of the tumor can be sent to a special lab to determine if hormonal therapy is likely to be effective.

      / Combination Treatments

        ## Hormones
        A hormone is an internally secreted compound, such as insulin or thyroxine, formed in [glossary term:] endocrine glands. Hormones affect the functions of specifically receptive organs or tissues when transported to them by the body fluids. Pharmaceutically, a hormone is a synthetic substance used in medicine to act like a compound when introduced into the body.

        Hormones help regulate body mechanisms such as growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

        Hormones can be used to alter the growth of cancer. Cancer therapy, which achieves its anti-tumor effect through changes in hormonal balance, is also called endocrine therapy. Some tissues, such as prostate or breast, depend on hormones to develop. When a malignancy arises in these tissues, it is usually hormone responsive. Other primaries and histologic types may be hormone responsive, such as melanoma and hypernephroma. Hormonal therapy may effect a long-term control of the cancer growth.

        Prednisone is a common hormone that is administered to cancer patients, especially in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy regimens.

        ## Anti-hormones
        An anti-hormone is an agent that works against a hormone or a hormone's response in the body. Many anti-hormone agents have been developed to interfere with the interaction between the hormone molecule and its receptor site, which stimulates cell growth and proliferation.

        Tamoxifen (also called Nolvadex) is the first anti-estrogen to achieve widespread clinical use. It has become standard first-line anti-hormonal therapy for metastatic breast cancer and for adjuvant therapy of early stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen acts by attaching to the cell surface estrogen receptor without initiating the intracellular processes which leads to proliferation. Its presence at the receptor site blocks the attachment estrogen and thus interferes with their actions on breast cells and breast cancer cells.

        Anti-androgens such as Flutamide are used as anti-hormone treatment in the medical management of advanced prostate cancer. Flutamide attaches to androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells and blocks the actions of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in stimulating cell growth.

      / Endocrine Surgery
      let surgery >
        Endocrine surgery is a surgical procedure that is performed to achieve a hormonal or anti-hormonal effect in the body.

        Surgical procedures to remove hormone-producing tissues are among the first attempts at endocrine therapy of cancer (e.g., oopherectomy or adrenalectomy for breast cancer, orchiectomy for prostate cancer). Radiotherapy, aimed at hormone-producing organs (e.g., ovaries), has been used to suppress hormone production in patients who were not considered to be surgical candidates.

        The use of drugs to suppress hormone production has replaced surgical approaches to endocrine therapy of breast cancer. However, orchiectomy remains a common approach for the hormonal management of prostate cancer because of the simplicity of the procedure, its immediate effect, and the lack of side effects associated with the drugs used to achieve the same hormonal suppression.

      / Introduction to Biological Therapy
      let intro >
        A relatively new approach for cancer treatment is biological therapy. This cancer treatment is also known as biotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological response modifier therapy.

        Biological therapy began with the discovery of immunization more than 200 years ago. Edward Jenner discovered the benefits of injecting humans with fluid taken from sores on cattle infected with cowpox, a disease also known as vaccinia. This fluid contains the organisms that produce the disease. His inoculation worked because the cells of the immune system developed [glossary term:] antibodies against the cowpox organism.

        About a century later, William Coley, a New York surgeon, started using biological therapy to treat cancer patients. He noticed that people with some kinds of cancer appeared to enter remission after developing certain bacterial infections. He concluded that the body's response to the infection must be exerting some effect on the cancer. He injected cancer patients with live [glossary term:] bacteria, then later with filtered toxins. This induced an infectious response that sometimes led to a remission of their cancer. This method of treatment became known as Coley's toxins and was used for decades.

        Paul Ehrlich, a German Nobel Prize winner in 1908, theorized that the surfaces of cells carried receptor molecules, or side chains as he called them. He pointed out that antibodies attached to these "side chains" triggered the release of antitoxins. He also believed that antibodies might be developed that could target invaders.

        In the mid-1980s, encouraging results were seen in the use of interferon to treat a rare blood disorder called hairy-cell leukemia. The FDA has approved interferon for this disease, as well as chronic myelogenous leukemia, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and genital warts.

        More recently, Steven Rosenberg, a researcher at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, proved that the human immune system could be directed to discriminate between healthy cells and cancerous ones. Handled properly, immunotherapy could indeed stimulate the body's defenses. In 1992 genetically engineered IL-2 received the FDA's approval for treating advanced kidney cancer. In 1994 clinical trials were started to determine whether another interleukin, interleukin ("IL-12"), might have some benefit against metastatic cancer and AIDS.

        To understand biological therapy, it helps to know some basics about the [glossary term:] immune system, a complex network of organs and cells.

        There are two basic types of defense protecting the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria, [glossary term:] viruses, or cancer cells. The first line of defense is a physical barrier involving the skin, mucous membranes, the lining of the respiratory tract. This line of defense produces a nonspecific response because it works regardless of the invader.

        The second line of defense, unlike the physical barrier, recognizes these invaders and then develops the specific weapons to fight them. It is even able to remember what the invader looked like so that the next time its response will be even swifter. This line of defense that produces a specific response is made by immune system cells. The immune system cells circulate throughout the body and defend the body against attacks by foreign invaders.

        This immune network is one of the body's main defenses against disease. It works against diseases, including cancer, in a variety of ways. For example, the immune system may recognize the difference between healthy cells and cancer cells in the body and work to eliminate those that become cancerous.

        Immune system cells include lymphocytes (white blood cells) and other immune cells. Lymphocytes are the most important cells of the immune system and can be categorized into [glossary term:] T-cells, [glossary term:] B-cells, and [glossary term:] NK (Natural Killer) cells.

        T-cells directly attack infected, foreign, or cancerous cells. T-cells also regulate the immune response by signaling other immune system defenders. B-cells secrete antibodies, the proteins that recognize and attach to foreign substances known as antigens. Natural Killer cells produce powerful chemical substances that bind to and kill any foreign invader. They attack without first having to recognize a specific antigen. Monocytes are white blood cells that circulate in the bloodstream. When they settle in tissue, the macrophages engulf the invaders and actually digest them.

        Understanding how immune system cells exchange messages and finding ways to make these messages clearer and stronger are the goals of research in immunology. Each of these components, and each step in the immune response, represents a potential avenue for the development of a cancer therapy.

        Biological therapy research focuses on isolating specific cells of the immune system and their chemical products, then manipulating them in the laboratory to target their activity and control their effects.

        In summary, biological therapies use the body's immune system, either directly or indirectly, to fight cancer or to reduce the side effects that may be caused by some cancer treatments.

      / Types of Biological Therapy
      let types >
        There are two basic categories of biological therapy: immunotherapy and cytotoxic therapy. Immunotherapy uses a variety of methods and drugs to manipulate the immune system. This creates a hostile environment for the existence or growth of cancer in the body. Cytotoxic therapy involves changing the cancer cells' biology so that they become weak and die.

        Immunotherapy
        Immunotherapy can be either active or passive. Active immunotherapy involves setting an immune response in the cancer patient to fight cancer cells. In passive immunotherapy, immune molecules are given to patients who do not produce them on their own. Both approaches can be specific or nonspecific.

        Specific Active Immunotherapy
        One way the immune system can recognize differences among cells is by molecules called antigens that appears on the cell surface. In active immunotherapy, cancer cells are analyzed in the lab and their antigens are identified. Then, a treatment is designed to stimulate a specific immune response against them. This is called specific active immunotherapy. Despite its theoretical worthiness, results of this approach have been disappointing and it has been generally abandoned by clinicians.

        Nonspecific Active immunotherapy
        The nonspecific active approach uses agents that set in motion a general immune response, activating a wide range of immune cells. The approach aims at strengthening the overall activity of the immune system instead of selectively arousing those elements most able to fight cancer. This approach has achieved some success.

        The agents used in this method include interferons and interleukins (IL-2 and IL-12, for example), as well as bacillus (or bacilli) Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the organism that causes tuberculosis. The immune response to tuberculosis can cause certain cancers to regress. Researchers have achieved some success by injecting nonspecific agents directly into body cavities where tumors are located. In two studies, for example, the use of BCG led to the complete remission of recurrent bladder tumors in about 70 percent of the patients.

        Passive Immunotherapy
        Passive immunotherapy, sometimes called adoptive immunotherapy, gives the cancer patient antibodies and other agents so that the patient adopts an immune response that has been developed in a test tube.

        The passive approach can be specific or nonspecific. Specific treatments include monoclonal antibodies (MABs), the so-called magic bullets, which can be designed to target certain cancer cells.

        One nonspecific technique involves removing some of the person's T-cells, culturing the cells in the lab, and then injecting expanded populations of the treated cells into cancer patients.

        An alternative approach is to activate lymphocytes taken from a person's tumor to create yet another agent, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and returning these "stranger" cells to the patient where they can fight the cancer cells.

        Cytotoxic Therapy (Tumor Cell Modulation)
        The second main category of biological therapy is sometimes called cytotoxic (cell-killing) therapy. This approach uses proteins called cytotoxins that are produced by the body's cells to attack the cancer either by destroying the cancer cells or by making it difficult for them to grow and reproduce. Another term for this approach is tumor cell modulation.

        Tumor cell modulation changes the cancer cell's biology so that they become weak and die. Some of the agents used in this approach are called cytotoxins. Perhaps the best-known cytotoxin in this category is tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a toxin secreted by activated macrophages to selectively kill tumor cells, principally by interfering with their blood supply.

        Certain agents make the antigens on cancer cells more recognizable to antibodies or make them stickier so that antibodies bind to them more easily. Other compounds interfere with the cell's ability to metastasize.

      / Biological Therapy Agents
      let agents >
        Biological therapy involves the use of biologically derived agents to modify the relationship between tumor and host, altering the host's biologic response to tumor cells, with a resultant therapeutic effect. Most biological therapies are designed to activate the patient's immune system and induce it to attack cancer cells. Common biological agents that have been approved for use in treating specific types of cancer are described below. Some of these are still under investigation.

        ## Interferons
        Interferons are proteins secreted by immune cells that interfere with a virus's ability to reproduce and proliferate. The human body produces interferons as part of the immune response. The name comes from the fact that they literally interfere with virus replication.

        Through recombinant DNA technology, various interferons have been genetically engineered for use in the medical treatment of disease. These agents increase the cell-killing activity of the immune system, making tumor cells more vulnerable to immune attack by increasing antigens and blocking the formation of new blood vessels by tumors. They also slow tumor cell replication by inhibiting DNA and protein synthesis.

        There are three known classes of interferons: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-interferons. Only alpha-interferon has been approved as a cancer treatment. For example, inteferon alfa-2b (Intron A) is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma and has proven to be effective for treating malignant melanoma.

        ## Monoclonal antibodies (MABs)
        Monoclonal antibodies are lab-engineered products. They are components of the immune system which are able to recognize and bind to a specific antigen. These lab-made antibodies are designed to react directly against certain tumor-associated proteins. They may be used by themselves or equipped with other molecules, such as toxins, chemotherapy drugs, or radioactive isotopes.

        Although MABs hold great potential for cancer treatment, complete success has been elusive.

        The only monoclonal antibodies available for routine use are for lymphomas, some types of breast cancer, and occasionally for bladder cancer. The early results of treatment with these therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been quite promising. Sometimes they have been given on their own, but more commonly in combination with conventional chemotherapy.

        ## Interleukins
        Interleukin (abbreviated IL) is a group of bioactive proteins produced by leukocytes, monocytes, and other cells that regulate the immune response. They act like messengers between the white blood cells of the immune system. Interleukin-2 increases the activity of lymphocytes, especially killer T-cells. Recombinant IL-2 is used for cancer therapy and continues to be studied as a biological therapy agent for other diseases.

        Growth factors are colony stimulating factors or hematopoietic growth factors. These substances promote the growth and maturation of normal cells. There are two types used in cancer treatment: one type stimulates bone marrow to make normal cells; the other acts as an anticancer agent. Colony stimulating factors are being used increasingly in the treatment of bone marrow transplant patients. They are also used for patients who develop anemia or low white blood cell counts because of cancer or cancer therapy.

        ## Tumor vaccines
        Vaccines against viral disease are effective in preventing human infections. They are administered to prevent infections for which effective treatments are not available, especially when active infection is associated with high mortality.

        Tumor vaccines are a type of immunotherapy that attempt to stimulate the patient's own immune system to respond to tumor antigens. Melanoma vaccines have been administered to patients for several decades in hopes of boosting immunity to the patient's melanoma, usually as an adjuvant to surgery. Tumor vaccines are still experimental.

        With further research and more secrets about the immune system revealed, the prospect of biological therapies looks promising and hopefully the role of biological therapies in the successful treatment of cancer will grow in future years.

      / Bone Marrow Transplants
      let bmt >
        A bone marrow transplant (BMT) is the removal of bone marrow from one person and the return of its blood-forming cells later to the same person or the transfer of the blood-forming cells to someone else. It is a relatively new medical procedure used to treat diseases such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, immune deficiency disorders, and some solid tumors. Bone marrow is the soft, sponge-like tissue found within the cavities of bones that contain fat and blood-forming tissue. It contains immature cells called stem cells that produce the body's blood cells. These blood cells include: white blood cells (leukocytes), which fight infection; red blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen to, and remove waste products from, organs and tissues; and platelets, which enable the blood to clot.

        Healthy bone marrow tissue constantly renews the blood supply and is essential to life. Unfortunately, the amount of drugs or radiation needed to kill cancer cells also destroys bone marrow. Bone marrow transplantation is often used as a rescue procedure, replacing stem cells that have been destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In some cancers, particularly those involving the blood cells, bone marrow transplantation is used to attack the malignancy directly. Acute leukemia, for example, was the first cancer to be successfully treated with bone marrow transplantation.

        The transplant procedure begins with the patient or donor providing stem cells. These blood-forming cells are stored while the patient's cancer cells are destroyed by chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to speed the recovery of bone marrow.

        Most bone marrow transplantation procedures are successful. The recipients are discharged promptly from the hospital after they have recovered. The long-term response rate varies greatly depending on the type and stage of cancer.

        There are three types of transplants according to the source of the bone marrow. An autologous transplant is the removal of bone marrow from the person with cancer before treatment and is returned to him/her after treatment with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both. In syngeneic transplants, patients receive stem cells from their identical twin. An allogeneic transplant is donated by someone other than the patient or an identical twin. Siblings are always a closer match than parents and more likely to be compatible than other family members. The best matches also come from someone of the same ancestry.

        As with some other cancer therapies, bone marrow transplants may also cause side effects, which should be recognized and effectively managed.

        Almost everyone who undergoes bone marrow transplant experiences lethargy, nausea, and vomiting because of the high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation that precede the transplant. Infection is an early serious danger for the patient, so the patient is closely monitored for fever and other signs of infection. Some patients may develop veno-occlusive disease, a very serious disease of the liver. Another major risk of bone marrow transplant is that the recipient's immune system may reject the transplanted "foreign" marrow.

        Despite the risk involved with bone marrow transplant, the procedure is still recommended by doctors and opted for by cancer patients as an effective weapon against cancer. Most cancer patients receiving them benefit greatly from successful bone marrow transplants. Unfortunately, many insurance plans do not cover bone marrow transplantation, and the high cost of this treatment is often the reason why BMT is not often performed.

      / Side Effects of Biological Therapy
      let sideeffects >
        Biological therapies may also cause side effects as the other cancer therapies discussed in the previous learning units. What side effects and how severe these side effects are depend on each individual patient and their treatment plan. The following are some common side effects caused by biological therapy drugs.

        When a biological therapy drug is given intravenously, the injection site can become red and sore. Serious phlebitis (vein inflammation) occasionally results. For most patients taking interferon, flu-like symptoms may develop: fever, chills, gastrointestinal upset, and body aches. The chills usually begin between two and six hours after drug administration and are marked by teeth chattering, shivers, and a pale complexion. The shivers cause the body temperature to rise, along with the pulse rate and the blood pressure.

        Fatigue is a very common side effect of biological therapy. For some patients, the feeling of tiredness may go away after the treatment has stopped; for some patients, however, the fatigue can become chronic.

        Some people may show allergic reactions to some drugs, including cough, wheezing, and skin rash. In extreme cases, fatal allergic reaction may occur.

        Due to the side effects of some drugs, many patients may experience confusion, disorientation, and depression. They may have trouble concentrating, performing simple calculations, or remembering things. These difficulties may interfere with their normal daily activities and ability to work. These side effects can be so severe that drug administration may be interrupted or the drug dose may have to be reduced.

        Successful management of the side effects caused by biological therapies can be achieved by experienced oncologist with the cooperation of a well-informed patient. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are important components of coping with the side effects.

      / Review: Biological Therapy
      let review >
        Edward Jenner, William Coley, Paul Ehrlich, and Steven Rosenberg are important names in the brief history of biological therapy research.

        Our immune system is a very important line of defense against "foreign invaders" such as bacteria, viruses, or cancer cells. What makes it unique is that it can recognize "foreign invaders," and then develop the specific weapons to fight them. Biological therapy uses materials made by our own body or made in a laboratory to boost, direct, or restore our body's natural defenses against diseases such as cancer.

        Two basic biological therapies exist: immunotherapy and cytotoxic therapy. Immunotherapy uses a variety of methods and drugs to manipulate the immune system to create a hostile environment for the cancer in the body, while cytotoxic therapy involves changing the cancer cells' biology so that they become weak and die.

        In biological therapy, biologically derived agents are either used to modify the relationship between tumor and host. This is altering the host's biologic response to tumor cells with a resultant therapeutic effect or by activating the patient's immune system and inducing to attack cancer cells. Common biological agents include interferons, monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, growth factors, and tumor vaccines. Side effects do occur with biological therapy, but the type of effects and severity of effects depend on each individual patient and the drug(s) they are administered.

        Bone marrow transplantation is often used to replace stem cells destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, or to directly attack the malignancy. Depending on the donor of the bone marrow, bone marrow transplant can be categorized as autologuous, syngeneic, or allogeneic.

    / Combination Treatments
    space comb
      >>>
        Combination treatments, sometimes called multimodal treatments, refer to the use of two or more kinds of therapies. Different kinds of therapies may be used in sequence, at the same time, or in various timing formats.

        Combining two or more types of treatments - such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy - may be more effective than a single therapy alone. Under certain conditions, combination therapy not only can achieve a greater likelihood of cure than a single approach, but can do so with less damage to vital organs and tissues.

        In the past, cancer treatment relied heavily on surgery, one of the oldest cancer treatment methods. For example, amputation of the affected limb used to be the only treatment for patients with osteosarcoma, a cancer of the bone found most often in young people. Now, radiation therapy directed at the tumor and chemotherapy delivered through the bloodstream may destroy the cancer without loss of the limb containing the tumor.

        Due to recent advances in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer, many patients receive lumpectomy (excision of the lump) followed by radiation therapy rather than mastectomy (removal of the entire breast). This has allowed many women to retain their desired natural contour without compromising the possibility of a cure.

        Treatments are combined for several reasons:

        One treatment may be more effective at a certain stage of cancer than another.
        One treatment may enhance the effectiveness of another synergy.
        One treatment alone may not affect the tumor.
        Depending on the stage of the disease, the oncologist will choose a primary therapy, the one that might have the most effective impact on the cancer. Then one or more other therapies may be selected to increase the possibility of cure.

        To enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy, some chemotherapy drugs are used to make certain kinds of cancer cells more susceptible to the radiation dose. Radiation therapy is generally most effective at the edges (margins) of a tumor but not as effective in the center of a tumor. Surgery can remove the tumor, but it may be unable to eliminate all cancer cells surrounding it without cutting out too much normal tissue. Therefore, the two treatments can be combined to work together, filling in the gaps of each other.

        It is uncommon for cancer to be treated by only one method. With new technologies and new drugs discovered almost daily, combination treatments have shown a promising outlook for cancer treatment.

      / Introduction
      let intro >
        In recent years, interest in alternative cancer treatment methods has grown tremendously. These approaches differ from the conventional medical treatments and are currently under study. They are also called unconventional, nontraditional, complementary, unproven, holistic, or questionable methods. Views about alternative cancer therapies vary greatly: believers have great faith in them, claiming they can do miracles while non-believers simply dismiss them as medical quackery.

        The major appeal of alternative treatments to cancer patients lies in the fact that, unless their disease is discovered at an early stage, most conventional treatments cannot promise cure while alternative therapies do, as claimed by the salespeople of these treatments. Some alternative treatments claim not only to cure cancer, but also to promise few or no objectionable side effects, which can be enormously tempting for cancer patients. Besides, alternative practitioners often appear more sympathetic, listening and talking to their patients more than the typical overscheduled physicians in busy managed-care or oncology settings.

        In general, these unconventional therapies not only cannot cure, butl also they have not been held to the same standards of proof of safety and effectiveness as have the conventional drugs and treatments prescribed by physicians. Some unconventional treatments may even interfere with the effectiveness of a scientifically valid conventional medical therapy. Some unconventional therapies may also cause injury or infection or other kinds of problems. What often causes so much dismay among traditional practitioners is that unproven therapies sometimes steer people away from scientifically valid treatments that would have been effective if they had not delayed it.

        However, despite the fact that some dubious treatments are still being sold to the public, taking advantage of the desperation of cancer patients and their families, some cancer doctors and well-respected scientists believe that some of the alternative treatments are worthy of serious study. In fact, some positive reports of unconventional treatments come from the medical community itself, and some methods are being used in some of the most prestigious cancer centers in this country. Some unconventional therapies are beginning to take their place alongside conventional treatments. These methods are usually used to improve the quality of life during treatment.

        In conjunction with conventional therapies, prayer, massage, meditation, and yoga are some of the methods used to alleviate anxiety and stress. Laetrile, holistic surgery, and ayurvedic therapies are the most common unconventional therapies that are used today. These are often called complementary methods. Nutritional therapy focuses on an eating plan to help improve the patient's well being, tolerance of treatment, and quality of life. Support groups can be a valuable part of cancer treatment because they can have a positive effect on the patient's overall attitude. Some evidence also suggests that social support may affect the immune system positively. Researchers are finding that some techniques, such as acupuncture, appear to relieve some symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and pain.

        Before seeking alternative treatments, cancer patients are strongly advised to discuss these with their oncologists and ask the same questions about alternative therapy as they do about conventional therapy so that they can make educated decisions regarding their cancer treatment.

      / Blinded Clinical Trial
      let trials >
        A blinded (or masked) clinical trial is a field study of a drug in which the recipient does not know if he is receiving the actual drug versus a placebo. A double-blind clinical trial is one in which both the recipient and the administrator does not know if the recipient is receiving the actual drug.

        The blinded trial approach has been shown to provide a more complete understanding of a drug's effectiveness, benefits, and the range of possible adverse reactions without the bias of the "placebo effect". It has been confirmed that a person's beliefs and hopes about a treatment, combined with their suggestibility, may have a significant biochemical effect.

        ## Placebo effect
        The placebo effect is the measure or observed effect on a person or group that has been given a placebo treatment.

        A placebo is an inert substance, or "fake" surgery or therapy, used as a control in an experiment or given to a patient for its possible or probable beneficial effect. Why an inert substance, a so-called "sugar pill," or a fake surgery or therapy would be effective, is not yet completely known.

        Many believe the placebo effect is psychological, due to either a real effect caused by belief or to a subjective delusion. For example: "If I believe the pill will help, it will help." Often, the patient's physical condition does not change, but it feels like it has. For example, Irving Kirsch, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut, believes that the effectiveness of Prozac and similar drugs may be attributed almost entirely to the placebo effect.

        Alternative therapies, also called unconventional, nontraditional, complementary, unproven, or holistic, are approaches that differ from the conventional medical treatments.

        The major appeal of alternative treatments to cancer patients is the promise of cure claimed by the salespeople. In fact, these treatments have not been held to the same standards of proof of safety and effectiveness as have the conventional drugs and treatments prescribed by physicians.

        Views about alternative cancer therapies vary greatly. There are firm believers, as well as staunch disbelievers, of these unconventional therapies. While many of these approaches fall far short of the results promised by their practitioners, some scientists still believe that some of the alternative treatments are worthy of serious study. Some of them are even being used alongside conventional treatments.
