      /Cloth facemask, homemade facemasks
    subject Clothmask
      head = The first category is the most common one: facemasks made with simple cloth. These typically have single to multiple layers of clothing which are cover the breathing area of the user. These simple masks are not regulated for their efficacy. A well designed and fitted cloth mask can also provide substantial protection against infection.

  >>> Guidance on the use of masks for the general public

    Studies of influenza, influenza-like illness, and human coronaviruses (not including COVID-19) provide evidence that the use of a medical mask can prevent the spread of infectious droplets from a symptomatic infected person (source control) to someone else and potential contamination of the environment by these droplets.  (54,55)

    There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in households, in particular those who share a house with a sick person, or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a measure preventing transmission. (41,56-61)

    A recent meta-analysis of these observational studies, with the intrinsic biases of observational data, showed that either disposable surgical masks or reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks were associated with protection of healthy individuals within households and among contacts of cases.(42)

    This could be considered to be indirect evidence for the use of masks (medical or other) by healthy individuals in the wider community; however, these studies suggest that such individuals would need to be in close proximity to an infected person in a household or at a mass gathering where physical distancing cannot be achieved, to become infected with the virus.
    Guidance

  >>> WHO recommends that persons with any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should (1, 2):

    Wear a medical mask, self-isolate, and seek medical advice as soon as they start to feel unwell with potential symptoms of COVID-19, even if symptoms are mild.

  >>>
    Older people and immunosuppressed patients may present with atypical symptoms such as fatigue, reduced alertness, reduced mobility, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, delirium, and absence of fever.(26, 66, 67) It is important to note that early symptoms for some people infected with COVID-19 may be very mild and unspecific;

  >>>
    follow instructions on how to put on, take off, and dispose of medical masks and perform hand hygiene;(68)

  >>>
    follow all additional measures, in particular respiratory hygiene, frequent hand hygiene and maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre (3.3 feet) from other persons.(42)

  >>> For all people
    In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended that all persons, regardless of whether they are using masks or not, should: avoid groups of people and crowded spaces (follow local advice); maintain physical distance of at least 1 metre (3.3 feet) from other persons, especially from those with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing, sneezing); perform hand hygiene frequently, using an alcohol-based handrub if hands are not visibly dirty or soap and water; use respiratory hygiene i.e. cover their nose and mouth with a bent elbow or paper tissue when coughing or sneezing, dispose of the tissue immediately after use, and perform hand hygiene; refrain from touching their mouth, nose, and eyes.

    We can ask the following questions at a population level.
    (i) How effective and how frequently would facemasks need to be used by the public to ‘flatten the disease progress curve’?
    (ii) How effective are facemasks at reducing the free-living SARS-CoV-2 inoculum and transmission rates?
    (iii) How does the timing of the implementation of lock-down periods and facemask adoption by the public influence the models' outcomes?

      #(!!clm).

  >>> Theoretical studies
    These typically look at the mathematical modeling of the spread of the virus with certain   assumptions. Typically they look at use of facemasks as one of the parameter to study the spread of virus in a typical population. Not all studies are Covid19 specific, studies with other respiratory diseases like H1N1, SARS, MERS or influenza can also provide vital information on how we appraoch the pandemic. The mathematical studies simulate the spread of the virus under various conditions and conclude/predict conditions for preventing the spread.

    The different types of facemasks described above vary in their efficacy to protect the user from getting infected (!!clm). The respirators, when properly used provide the best protection (!!clm). While, cloth facemasks or surgical masks might not provide any protection, or very little protection to the users from getting infected (!!clm). And most studies indicate that wearing facemasks is only one of the steps in combating the spread of the virus (!!clm).

  >>> Facemasks in combination with other Measures
    The use of the facemasks has to be along with other measures like social distancing and handwashing (!!clm) makes them more effective. A study has found that facemasks and hand hygiene were correlated with a 35–51% reduction in influenza-like illness (!!clm).

Certified FFRs must also ensure unhindered breathing with maximum resistances during inhalation and exhalation. Another important difference is the way filtration is tested; medical mask filtration tests are performed on a cross- section of the masks whereas FFRs are tested for filtration across the entire surface. Therefore, the layers of the filtration material and the FFR shape, ensuring outer edges of the FFR seal around wearer’s face, result in a guaranteed claimed filtration when worn compared to the open shape, or leaking structure, of medical masks. Other FFR performance requirements include being within specified parameters for maximum CO2 build up, total inward leakage and tensile strength of straps.
