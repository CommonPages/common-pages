    The virus may be detectable in the upper respiratory tract (URT) 1- 3 days before the onset of symptoms. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the URT is highest around the time of symptom onset, after which it gradually declines.

    # Antigen


     ## Background
     # detect the presence of viral proteins in a biological sample, such as saliva or tissue swabbed from the nasal cavity. Antigen tests are typically cheap, return results in minutes, and, like the genetic tests, reveal an active infection. They already exist for strep throat, influenza, tuberculosis, HIV, and other infectious diseases.

     # Rapid diagnostic tests that detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins (antigens) in respiratory tract specimens are being developed and commercialized. Most of these are lateral flow immunoassays (LFI), which are typically completed within 30 minutes. In contrast to NAATs, there is no amplification of the target that is detected, making antigen tests less sensitive. Additionally, false- positive (indicating that a person is infected when they are not) results may occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, such other human coronaviruses.

    # The sensitivity of different RDTs compared to rRT-PCR in specimens from URT (nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs) appears to be highly variable [144, 163-165], but specificity is consistently reported to be high.

    # >>> WHO Background
    # Sensitivity is the percentage of cases positive by a NAAT reference standard that are detected as positive by the Ag-RDT under evaluation.
    # Specificity is the percentage of cases negative by a NAAT reference standard that are detected as negative by the Ag-RDT under evaluation. The prevalence of disease in the community being tested strongly affects the predictive value of a positive or negative result . Thus, the clinical value of a positive or negative test result will depend on what action is taken on the basis of the test result when interpreted in the context of local prevalence.
    # negative and positive Predictive value (take background contentt for wikipedia)
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value
    # The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) are the proportions of positive and negative results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true positive and true negative results, respectively. The PPV and NPV describe the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic.

 ### DiagnosticClaims

  # SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a wide range of other body fluids and compartments, but it is most frequently detected in respiratory material and, therefore, respiratory samples remain the sample type of choice for diagnostics.

   # For confirmation of a recent infection, acute and convalescent sera must be tested using a validated (semi)quantitative or quantitative assay.

  #  The first sample should be collected during the acute phase of illness, and the second sample at least 14 days after the initial sera was collected. Maximum antibody levels are expected to occur in the third/fourth week after symptom onset.

  #  Seroconversion or a rise in antibody titres in paired sera will help to confirm whether the infection is recent and/or acute. If the initial sample tests positive, this result could be due to a past infection that is not related to the current illness.
  # Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection, except in instances in which viral testing is delayed. An antibody test may not show if you have a current COVID-19 infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies.

  ### Serology

  ### This is just notes for my ref.
  # paper- Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study.

   #  If my antibody test is positive, am I immune?
   #  # Clouding the interpretation of a positive antibody test is that we do not yet know if antibodies against RBD make people immune. We also don’t know how much of this antibody against RBD is needed to ensure protection.
   #
   # not all of the antibody tests for COVID-19 measure antibodies against RBD. Some tests measure antibodies against parts of the virus that are not needed for cell entry. These antibodies that are not against the RBD will recognize the virus but will not block it from infecting human cells and triggering viral infection. So only antibodies that block the spike protein from connecting to the ACE2 receptor are guaranteed to provide immunity. And only antibody tests that measure the amount of these antibodies can predict immunity.

   # if through serology if you can find anti RBD- provide protective Immunity

   # And only antibody tests that measure the amount of these antibodies can predict immunity. block the spike protein from connecting to the ACE2 receptor are guaranteed to provide immunity.





 ### Antibodies

 # The duration of the persistence of antibodies generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 is still under study [49, 174].

 # Studies show that several commercial assays measuring total Ig or IgG have performed well. Most of these studies show no advantage of IgM over IgG, as IgM does not appear much earlier than IgG [173].


 # We know that in a test tube antibodies against the virus can neutralize it. That is, they can prevent the virus from entering into a human cell and causing an infection. But not every antibody is equally capable of preventing the virus from causing an infection. The very best antibodies are ones that neutralize the receptor binding domain of the new coronavirus spike protein that attaches to the host cell’s ACE2 receptor. The RBD is on the tip of the spike protein and is the part of the spike that touches ACE2. Antibodies against RBD block the very first step of viral infection, which is when the coronavirus attaches the human cell membrane.

 #     Although the IgM level reached its peak as in SARS‐CoV, it could remain persistently high in these patients even until the ninth week. The high levels of IgM indicated the duration of viral infection and may be related to the prolonged viral RNA shedding.
