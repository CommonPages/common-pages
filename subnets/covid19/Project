description: "The Claimspace COVID-19 portal is an ongoing collective effort to make sense of the developing news and research surrounding the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. The goal of the portal is not to make authoritative claims—rather it is to organize the spectrum of claims and relevant background concepts in biology, medicine, and epidemiology, to support collective critical thinking."
