description: "The Claimspace COVID-19 portal is a collective effort to make sense of the developing news and research surrounding the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. The goal of the portal is not to make authoritative claimsâ€”rather it is to organize the spectrum of claims alongside foundational concepts in biology, medicine, and epidemiology, to support collective critical thinking."
