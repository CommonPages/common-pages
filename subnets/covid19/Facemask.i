Their performance characteristics are tested according to a set of standardized test methods. Till 1970s most of the surgical masks were resuable cotton masks and since then they are mostly single use disposable masks

        head = Filtering facepiece respirators (FFR), or respirators, similarly offer a balance of filtration and breathability; however, whereas medical masks filter 3 micrometre droplets, respirators must filter more challenging 0.075 micrometre solid particles. Certified FFRs must also ensure unhindered breathing with maximum resistances during inhalation and exhalation. Another important difference is the way filtration is tested; medical mask filtration tests are performed on a cross- section of the masks whereas FFRs are tested for filtration across the entire surface. Therefore, the layers of the filtration material and the FFR shape, ensuring outer edges of the FFR seal around wearerâ€™s face, result in a guaranteed claimed filtration when worn compared to the open shape, or leaking structure, of medical masks. Other FFR performance requirements include being within specified parameters for maximum CO2 build up, total inward leakage and tensile strength of straps.

    subject SpreadMechanism
      head = Whether to wear masks or not: answer to this question depends a lot on the mode of transmission of the virus. The mechanism of spreading in any pandemic will determine the steps taken to handle it. So far studies have shown that Covid19 has different spread mechanisms. There is an emerging evidence that there is also an aerial route for transmision of the virus which makes the use of masks a necessity.  The virus spreads from both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals primarily via respiratory droplets and contact of common surfaces and other bodily fluids and excretions.

        There is also evidence that wearing masks will reduce the viral inoculum leading to higher rates of mild asymptomatic infections. The initial viral load during getting an infection has shown to be correlated to the severity of the infection. Wearing any type of mask reduces this load and hence is effective than wearing no protection at all.
        This could be considered to be indirect evidence for the use of masks (medical or other) by healthy individuals in the wider community; however, these studies suggest that such individuals would need to be in close proximity to an infected person in a household or at a mass gathering where physical distancing cannot be achieved, to become infected with the virus.
