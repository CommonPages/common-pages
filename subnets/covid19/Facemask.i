subject module Facemask
  head = A covering of the face can be called as a facemask. But there exists a variety of facemasks from a N95 mask to a simple hankercheif. But we make a distinction between the various types of facemasks. This page provides the readers with scientifically supported summaries regarding various questions and themes concerning use of facemasks to counter the Covid19 pandemic. Various aspects of the facemasks are covered supported by peer-reviewed scientific articles.

    subject Clothmask
      head = The first category is the most common one: facemasks made with simple cloth. These typically have single to multiple layers of clothing which are cover the breathing area of the user. These simple masks are not regulated for their efficacy. A well designed and fitted cloth mask can also provide substantial protection against infection.

        head = Medical masks (also called as surgical masks) are defined as surgical or procedure masks that are flat or pleated; they are affixed to the head with straps that go around the ears or head or both. Their performance characteristics are tested according to a set of standardized test methods. Till 1970s most of the surgical masks were resuable cotton masks and since then they are mostly single use disposable masks

Some other examples include Elastometric Half Face Respirators, Elastometric Full Face Respirators, and Powered Air-Puryfying Respirators.

      line 'Respirators
        head = Filtering facepiece respirators (FFR), or respirators, similarly offer a balance of filtration and breathability; however, whereas medical masks filter 3 micrometre droplets, respirators must filter more challenging 0.075 micrometre solid particles. Certified FFRs must also ensure unhindered breathing with maximum resistances during inhalation and exhalation. Another important difference is the way filtration is tested; medical mask filtration tests are performed on a cross- section of the masks whereas FFRs are tested for filtration across the entire surface. Therefore, the layers of the filtration material and the FFR shape, ensuring outer edges of the FFR seal around wearerâ€™s face, result in a guaranteed claimed filtration when worn compared to the open shape, or leaking structure, of medical masks. Other FFR performance requirements include being within specified parameters for maximum CO2 build up, total inward leakage and tensile strength of straps.
