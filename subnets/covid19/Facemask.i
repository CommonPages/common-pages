subject module Facemask
  head = A covering of the face can be called as a facemask. But there exists a variety of facemasks from a N95 mask to a simple hankercheif. But we make a distinction between the various types of facemasks. This page provides the readers with scientifically supported summaries regarding various questions and themes concerning use of facemasks to counter the Covid19 pandemic. Various aspects of the facemasks are covered supported by peer-reviewed scientific articles.

        head = Filtering facepiece respirators (FFR), or respirators, similarly offer a balance of filtration and breathability; however, whereas medical masks filter 3 micrometre droplets, respirators must filter more challenging 0.075 micrometre solid particles. Certified FFRs must also ensure unhindered breathing with maximum resistances during inhalation and exhalation. Another important difference is the way filtration is tested; medical mask filtration tests are performed on a cross- section of the masks whereas FFRs are tested for filtration across the entire surface. Therefore, the layers of the filtration material and the FFR shape, ensuring outer edges of the FFR seal around wearerâ€™s face, result in a guaranteed claimed filtration when worn compared to the open shape, or leaking structure, of medical masks. Other FFR performance requirements include being within specified parameters for maximum CO2 build up, total inward leakage and tensile strength of straps.

  / Effectiveness of wearing facemasks in public areas by different individuals
  subject Whofacemask
    head = What is the evidence for a need for wearing a facemask? The opinion on this issue has undergone revisions since the start of the Covid19. In this section we look at the evidence and recommendations of various studies in this regard.

    >>>
      When people are infected with the Covid19 virus they develop symptoms of the virus (these people are called as symptomatic). Symptomatic conditions of the infection can be severe to mild. Some people may display symptoms slightly after they get infected, such stage is called pre-symtomatic. But not all people develop these symptoms even when infected, these are called as {foundations.Immunology.Asymptomatic asymptomatic}.

      The virus spreads from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals primarily via respiratory droplets and {'Fomitesdef contact of common surfaces}.
