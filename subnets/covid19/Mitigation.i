Certified FFRs must also ensure unhindered breathing with maximum resistances during inhalation and exhalation. Another important difference is the way filtration is tested; medical mask filtration tests are performed on a cross- section of the masks whereas FFRs are tested for filtration across the entire surface. Therefore, the layers of the filtration material and the FFR shape, ensuring outer edges of the FFR seal around wearerâ€™s face, result in a guaranteed claimed filtration when worn compared to the open shape, or leaking structure, of medical masks. Other FFR performance requirements include being within specified parameters for maximum CO2 build up, total inward leakage and tensile strength of straps.
