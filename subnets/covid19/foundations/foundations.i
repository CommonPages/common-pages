      Virus
    >>>
      Viruses consist of a core of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protective coat made of protein.

      When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. This process is called viral replication.
    --
      ViralReplication
    >>>
      Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble only in the infected host cell, by hijacking the host cell's own protein synthesis process. The virus "tricks" the cell into following its own genetic instructions, rather than the genetic instructions of the host cell. The cell then replicates the virus' own genetic material, and synthesizes proteins required for the entire virus to replicate.

      Viruses that have their own DNA hijack the host cell's protein synthesis process at the very start. These are called DNA Viruses.

    model Replication
      head = Self-replication is any behavior of a dynamical system that yields construction of an identical or similar copy of itself.

    model DNA
      head = Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that stores genetic information.

    model Organism
      head = An organism, or life form, is any individual entity that embodies the properties of life.

    model RNA
      head = Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a molecule that is essential in in coding, decoding, regulating and expressing genes.

    model Protein
      = Proteins are biochemical compounds that are essential to the functioning of all living organisms, from cells to human beings.

    model ProteinSynthesis
      head = Protein biosynthesis (or protein synthesis) is a core biological process, occurring inside cells, balancing the loss of cellular proteins through the production of new proteins.

    model Microorganism
      head = A microorganism, or microbe is a microscopic organism, which may exist in its single-celled form or in a colony of cells.

    model Pathogen
      head = A pathogen is microorganism that can produce disease. A pathogen may also be referred to as an infectious agent, or simply a germ.

    model Host
      head = A host is an organism that harbours another organism (a guest). The guest is typically provided with nourishment and shelter.

    model Infection
      head = An infection is the invasion of an organism by pathogens, their replication, and the reaction of host to the infectious agents and the toxins they produce.

    model Virus
      head = A virus is a submicroscopic pathogen that replicates inside the cells of another living organism, causing an infection. Viruses can infect all types of organisms, from cells to bacteria, plants, animals and humans.

      # >>>
      #   When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell. But unlike simpler infectious agents, they contain genes, which allow them to mutate and evolve.
      #
      #   When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or virions, consisting of: (i) the genetic material, i.e. long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside envelope of lipids. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope as they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.
      #
      #   Viral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and plants. In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the immune system, which can provide lifetime immunity to the host for that virus.

    # Virus particles (known as virions) consist of genetic material, which can be either DNA or RNA, wrapped in a protein coat called the capsid; some viruses also have an outer lipid envelope.

    # A virus is made up of a core of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protective coat called a capsid which is made up of protein.
    # A virus is a small parasite that cannot reproduce by itself. Once it infects a susceptible cell, however, a virus can direct the cell machinery to produce more viruses. Most viruses have either RNA or DNA as their genetic material. The nucleic acid may be single- or double-stranded. The entire infectious virus particle, called a virion, consists of the nucleic acid and an outer shell of protein.

    # When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.

    model ViralReplication
      head = Viral replication is the formation of biological viruses during the infection process in the target host cells.

    / DNA Virus
    model DNAVirus
      head = A DNA virus is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.

    / RNA Virus
    model RNAVirus
      head = An RNA virus is a virus that has RNA as its genetic material.

      # Notable human diseases caused by RNA viruses include the common cold, influenza, SARS, COVID-19, hepatitis C, hepatitis E, West Nile fever, Ebola virus disease, rabies, polio and measles.

  model module Immunology

    model InfectiousDisease
      head = An infectious disease, also known as a transmissible disease or communicable disease, is an illness resulting from an infection.

    # Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms.[163] Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections.[164] Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicabilityâ€”a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal.[164] This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks.[165] When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.

    model Shedding
      >>>
        The term is used to refer to shedding from a single cell, shedding from one part of the body into another part of the body, and shedding from bodies into the environment where the viruses may infect other bodies.

    model Transmission
      head = Transmission is the passing of a pathogen causing communicable disease from an infected host individual or group to a particular individual or group, regardless of whether the other individual was previously infected.

      # airborne â€“ coughing, sneezing, breathing.[citation needed]
      # airborne infection â€“ really small dry and wet particles that stay in the air for long periods of time allowing airborne contamination even after the departure of the host. Particle size < 5 Î¼m.
      # droplet infection â€“ small and usually wet particles that stay in the air for a short period of time. Contamination usually occurs in the presence of the host. Particle size > 5 Î¼m.
      # direct physical contact â€“ touching an infected individual, including sexual contact
      # indirect physical contact â€“ usually by touching a contaminated surface, including soil (fomite)
      # fecal-oral transmission â€“ usually from unwashed hands, contaminated food or water sources due to lack of sanitation and hygiene, an important transmission route in pediatrics, veterinary medicine and developing countries.
      # Transmission can also be indirect, via another organism, either a vector (e.g. a mosquito or fly) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs can be transmitted to humans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission could involve zoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more complex life cycles. Transmissions can be autochthonous (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.

    # >>>
    #   Hosts can fight infections using their immune system.

    model ImmuneSystem
      head = The immune system is a host defense system comprising many structures and processes within an organism that protect it against disease. Immune mechanisms help an organism identify and neutralize pathogens.

    # Hosts can fight infections using their immune system. Mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response, often involving inflammation, followed by an adaptive response.

    # The adaptive immune system, also referred as the acquired immune system, is a subsystem of the immune system that is composed of specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminates pathogens by preventing their growth.

    model Immunity
      head = Immunity is the balanced state of multicellular organisms having adequate biological defenses to fight infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion, while having adequate tolerance to avoid allergy, and autoimmune diseases.

    # Acquired immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.

  model module Medicine
    # Immunization
    # Limit exposure to environments
    # Remove virus from enviroments
    # Prevent virus entry into the body
    # Medication

    model Immunization
      head = Immunization is the process by which an individual's immune system becomes fortified against a pathogen.

    # When this system is exposed to molecules that are foreign to the body, called non-self, it will orchestrate an immune response, and it will also develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of immunological memory. This is a function of the adaptive immune system. Therefore, by exposing an animal to an immunogen in a controlled way, its body can learn to protect itself: this is called active immunization.

    # Immunization is done through various techniques, most commonly vaccination.

    model Vaccination
      head = Vaccination is the administration of an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism. Vaccines contain a microorganism or virus in a weakened, live or killed state, or proteins or toxins from the organism. In stimulating the body's adaptive immunity, they help prevent sickness from an infectious disease.

    # Infection prevention and control

    # Exposure
    # Countermeasures, neutralize, inactivate

    # model Prophylaxis

    # In the absence of immunity... other measures.

    model Quarantine
      head = A quarantine is a restriction on the movement of people and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a communicable disease, but do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis.

    model SocialDistancing
      head = Social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures taken to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It typically involves maintaining a certain distance from others and avoiding gathering together in large groups.

    model Sterilization
      head = Sterilization refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life and biological agents present in a specific surface, object or fluid.

      # Sterilization refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life (in particular referring to microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, spores, unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as Plasmodium, etc.) and other biological agents like prions present in a specific surface, object or fluid, for example food or biological culture media.[1][2] Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is distinct from disinfection, sanitization, and pasteurization, in that those methods reduce rather than eliminate all forms of life and biological agents present. After sterilization, an object is referred to as being sterile or aseptic.

    model Disinfection
      head = Disinfection is the application of chemical agents designed to inactivate or destroy microorganisms on inert surfaces.

      # [1] Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant bacterial spores; it is less effective than sterilization, which is an extreme physical or chemical process that kills all types of life.[1] Disinfectants are generally distinguished from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, which destroy microorganisms within the body, and antiseptics, which destroy microorganisms on living tissue. Disinfectants are also different from biocides â€” the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life, not just microorganisms. Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with their metabolism.

      # Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect.[2] Disinfectants kill more germs than sanitizers.[3] Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals, dental surgeries, kitchens, and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms.

      # alcohol, hand sanitizer, bleach

    model HandHygeine
      head = Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances. Hand washing with soap at critical moments during the day prevents the spread of many diseases.

      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing

    model SurgicalMask
      head = A surgical mask is intended to be worn by health professionals during procedures in surgery and nursing. It is designed to prevent infections by catching bacteria shed from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or viruses whose particles are smaller.

      # , and they are less effective than respirators, such as N95 or FFP masks, which provide better protection due to their material, shape and tight seal

    model Respirators
      head = A respirator is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including fumes, vapours, gases and particulate matter such as dusts and airborne microorganisms.

      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respirator
      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N95_mask

    model ClothFaceMask
      head = A cloth face mask is a mask made of common textiles, usually cotton, worn over the mouth and nose. Unlike surgical masks and respirators such as N95 masks, they are not regulated for their effectiveness.

      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth_face_mask

    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbicide

    model PreExposureProphylaxis
      head = Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of drugs to prevent disease in people who have not yet been exposed to a disease-causing agent, usually a virus.

    model PostExposureProphylaxis
      head = Post-exposure prophylaxis, also known as post-exposure prevention (PEP), is any preventive medical treatment started after exposure to a pathogen in order to prevent the infection from occurring.

    model Antivirals
      head = Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used for treating viral infections. Antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen; instead they inhibit their development.

  model module Epidemiology
    # https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section10.html

    model Reservoirs
      head = The reservoir of an infectious agent is the habitat in which the agent normally lives, grows, and multiplies. Reservoirs include humans, animals, and the environment.

    model Recombination
      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination
      head = Genetic recombination (also known as genetic reshuffling) is the exchange of genetic material between different organisms which leads to production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.

    model Strain
      head = A strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism (e.g., virus or bacterium or fungus). New viral strains can be created due to mutation or swapping of genetic components when two or more viruses infect the same cell in nature.

    model NovelStrain
      head = Novel virus refers to a virus not seen before. It can be a virus that is isolated from its natural reservoir or isolated as the result of spread to an animal or human host where the virus had not been identified before.

    model IndexCase
      head = The index case (sometimes referred to as patient zero) is the first documented patient in a disease epidemic within a population, or the first documented patient included in an epidemiological study.

    model Outbreak

    model R0
      head = In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, and denoted R0, pronounced R nought or R zero) of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.
