  model ViralLoad
    head = Viral load, also known as viral burden, viral titre or viral titer, is a numerical expression of the quantity of virus in a given volume.

  model Antiseptics
    head = Antiseptics are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction.

  model Asepsis
    head = Asepsis is the state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms (such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses, pathogenic fungi, and parasites).

  model ContaminatedSurface
    head = Any surface which is likely to have pathogens with a potential to cause an infection. Often, the pathogens do not last beyond a particular duration depending upon the nature of the surface.

  / Spillover Event
  model SpilloverEvent
    head = Spillover event, occurs when a reservoir population with a high pathogen prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population. The pathogen is transmitted from the reservoir population and may or may not be transmitted within the host population.

  model PhylogeneticTree
    head = A phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entitiesâ€”their phylogeny based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics.

  / Viral Envelope
  model ViralEnvelope
    head = A viral envelope is the outermost layer of many types of viruses. It protects the genetic material in their life-cycle when traveling between host cells. Not all viruses have envelopes.
