  // Low-cost measurement of facemask efficacy for filtering expelled droplets during speech
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd3083
  ref 'Fischer_et_al_08_2020
    head = Mandates for mask use in public during the recent Covid-19 pandemic have led to widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives. It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have demonstrated a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech.

    quote !a = In proof-of-principle studies, we compared a variety of commonly available mask types and observed that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck fleece or bandanas, offer very little protection.

    / Science Advances — September 2, 2020
    quote !b = Speaking through some masks (particularly the neck fleece) seemed to disperse the largest droplets into a multitude of smaller droplets and considering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive.

    / Science Advances — September 2, 2020
    quote !c = The performance of the valved N95 mask is likely affected by the exhalation valve, which opens for strong outwards airflow. While the valve does not compromise the protection of the wearer, it can decrease protection of persons surrounding the wearer.

  // The Evolution of the Surgical Mask: Filtering Efficiency Versus Effectiveness
  doi: https://doi.org/10.2307/30141964
  ref 'Belkin_1997
    head = When originally introduced for use at the turn of the century, the primary function of the surgical mask was to prevent the migration of microorganisms residing in the nose and mouth of members of the operating team to the open wound of the patient. As technology developed new materials and designs, their filtering efficiencies gradually improved. However, there is no standard test method for assessing that capability, and its influence on the rates of surgical-wound infection has yet to be demonstrated. Quite to the contrary, both in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicate that a mask may not be universally necessary in today's surgical environment.

    # there is an interesting table on page 7 which tells in which situations general public should  be encouraged to wear which type of masks and their advantages

    / Evidence on transmission of Covid-19

    quote !a = Current evidence suggests that most transmission of Covid-19 is occurring from symptomatic people to others in close contact, when not wearing appropriate PPE.

    / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - viral load before onset of symptoms
    quote !b = People who develop symptoms appear to have higher viral loads on or just prior to the day of symptom onset, relative to later on in their infection.
    / Recommendation/Policy: Use of facemasks by medical professionals
    quote !c = To be fully effective, continuous wearing of a medical mask by health workers, throughout their entire shift, should be implemented along with other measures to reinforce frequent hand hygiene and physical distancing among health workers in shared and crowded places where mask use may be unfeasible such as cafeterias, dressing rooms, etc.
    / General Risks/Disadvantages of wearing masks
    quote !d = Self-contamination due to the manipulation of the mask by contaminated hands; potential self-contamination that can occur if medical masks are not changed when wet, soiled or damaged; possible development of facial skin lesions, irritant dermatitis or worsening acne, when used frequently for long hours; masks may be uncomfortable to wear; false sense of security, leading to potentially less adherence to well recognized preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene; risk of droplet transmission and of splashes to the eyes if mask wearing is not combined with eye protection; disadvantages for or difficulty wearing them by specific vulnerable populations such as those with mental health disorders, developmental disabilities, the deaf and hard of hearing community, and children; difficulty wearing them in hot and humid environments.


    # / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - type of clothing
    / Recommendation/Policy: Type of clothing
    quote !e1 = The selection of material is an important first step as the filtration (barrier) and breathability varies depending on the fabric. Filtration efficiency is dependent on the tightness of the weave, fibre or thread diameter, and, in the case of non-woven materials, the manufacturing process (spunbond, meltblown, electrostatic charging). The filtration of cloth fabrics and masks has been shown to vary between 0.7% and 60%.
    # (49, 72) (73, 74)


    / Effect of layers of clothing
    quote !e = Fabric cloths (e.g., nylon blends and 100% polyester) when folded into two layers, provides 2-5 times increased filtration efficiency compared to a single layer of the same cloth, and filtration efficiency increases 2-7 times if it is folded into 4 layers. Masks made of cotton handkerchiefs alone should consist of at least 4 layers, but have achieved only 13% filtration efficiency. Very porous materials, such as gauze, even with multiple layers will not provide sufficient filtration; only 3% filtration efficiency.
    / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - number and type of layers
    quote !f = A minimum of three layers is required for non-medical masks, depending on the fabric used. Choose water-absorbing (hydrophilic) materials or fabrics for the internal layers, to readily absorb droplets, combined with an external synthetic material that does not easily absorb liquid (hydrophobic).

    / Recommendations: mask maintenance
    quote !g = Masks should only be used by one person. All masks should be changed if wet or visibly soiled; a wet mask should not be worn for an extended period of time. Remove the mask without touching the front of the mask, do not touch the eyes or mouth after mask removal. Either discard the mask or place it in a sealable bag where it is kept until it can be washed and cleaned. Perform hand hygiene immediately afterwards. Non-medical masks should be washed frequently and handled carefully, so as not to contaminate other items.

    / Recommendations: mask maintenance

    quote !h =  Wash in warm hot water, 60°C, with soap or laundry detergent. Where hot water is not available, wash mask with soap/detergent at room temperature water, followed by either i) boiling mask for one minute OR ii) soak mask in 0.1% chlorine for one minute then thoroughly rinse mask with room temperature water, to avoid any toxic residual of chlorine.

    / Recommendation/Policy: Use of respirators by medical professionals

    quote !i = Health workers when not performing (Aerosol generating procedures) AGPs should wear medical mask, when performing AGP should wear a respirator. Suspected Covid-19 or person with mild symptoms should wear a medical mask as much as possible; the mask should be changed at least once daily. Persons who cannot tolerate a medical mask should rigorously apply respiratory hygiene.

    / Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission is possible

    quote !j = Viable virus has been isolated from specimens of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, suggesting, therefore, that people who do not have symptoms may be able transmit the virus to others.

    / Recommendation/Policy: Use of medical masks by medical professionals
    quote !k = In the absence of AGPs, WHO recommends that health workers providing direct care to Covid-19 patients, should wear a medical mask (in addition to other PPE that are part of droplet and contact precautions);

    / Recommendation/Policy: Healthcare workers in AGPs settings
    quote !l = in care settings for Covid-19 patients where AGPs are performed (e.g. Covid-19 intensive and semi-intensive care units), WHO recommends that health workers should wear a respirator (N95 or FFP2 or FFP3 standard, or equivalent)

    /Recommendation/Policy: Caregivers
    quote !l1 = Caregivers or those who are sharing living space with suspected Covid-19 person wear a medical mask when in the same room as the affected person;

    / WHO Advisory on use of Facemasks - AGP list
    quote !m = The WHO list of AGPs includes: tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, bronchoscopy, sputum induction induced by using nebulized hypertonic saline, and autopsy procedures.

    / Recommendation/Policy: Information that should be communicated to general public

    quote !n = Clearly communicate the purpose of wearing a mask, where, when, how and what type of mask should be worn. Explain what wearing a mask may achieve and what it will not achieve, and communicate clearly that this is one part of a package of measures along with hand hygiene, physical distancing and other measures that are all necessary and all reinforce each other; inform/train people on when and how to use masks safely, i.e. put on, wear, remove, clean and dispose; consider the feasibility of use, supply/access issues, social and psychological acceptance (of both wearing and not wearing different types of masks in different contexts); continue gathering scientific data and evidence on the effectiveness of mask use (including different types and makes as well as other face covers such as scarves) in non-health care settings; evaluate the impact (positive, neutral or negative) of using masks in the general population (including behavioral and social sciences).

    / Recommendation: Clothmasks efficacy and use
    quote !o = The lower filtration and breathability standardized requirements, and overall expected performance, indicate that the use of non-medical masks, made of woven fabrics such as cloth, and/or non-woven fabrics, should only be considered for source control (used by infected persons) in community settings and not for prevention.  They can be used ad-hoc for specific activities (e.g., while on public transport when physical distancing cannot be maintained), and their use should always be accompanied by frequent hand hygiene and physical distancing.

    # WHO Advisory on the use of Facemasks - Fabric selection
    / Recommendation/Policy: Fabric selection
    quote !p = Choose materials that capture particles and droplets but remain easy to breathe through. Avoid stretchy material for making masks as they provide lower filtration efficiency during use and are sensitive to washing at high temperatures. Fabrics that can support high temperatures (60° or more) are preferable.

    / Recommendation/policy: Face shields
    quote !q = In the context of non-medical mask shortage, face shields may be considered as an alternative noting that they are inferior to mask with respect to prevention of droplet transmission. If face shields are to be used, ensure proper design to cover the sides of the face and below the chin. In addition, they may be easier to wear for individuals with limited compliance with medical masks (such as those with mental health disorders, developmental disabilities, deaf and hard of hearing community and children).

    / Recommendation/Policy: Use of medical masks by he community
    quote !r = The use of medical masks in the community may divert this critical resource from the health workers and others who need them the most. In settings where medical masks are in short supply, ** medical masks should be reserved for health workers and at-risk individuals when indicated **.

    / Recommendation/Policy: Symptomatic persons
    quote !s = Wear a medical mask, self-isolate, and seek medical advice as soon as they start to feel unwell with potential symptoms of Covid-19, even if symptoms are mild.

    / Recommendation/Policy: Use of facemasks by all people
    quote !t = In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is recommended that all persons, regardless of whether they are using masks or not, should: avoid groups of people and crowded spaces (follow local advice); maintain physical distance of at least 1 metre (3.3 feet) from other persons, especially from those with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing, sneezing); perform hand hygiene frequently, using an alcohol-based handrub if hands are not visibly dirty or soap and water; use respiratory hygiene i.e. cover their nose and mouth with a bent elbow or paper tissue when coughing or sneezing, dispose of the tissue immediately after use, and perform hand hygiene; refrain from touching their mouth, nose, and eyes.

  doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.57.11.855
  ref 'Syed_et_al_2003
    head = SARS has been called the first global epidemic of the 21st century and has been the cause of a massive and varied public health response in many countries of the world.  Though of uncertain protective benefit, the wearing of masks may have contributed to the awareness of the collective and personal responsibility in combating infectious disease. Active and empowered involvement of the general public in implementing and cooperating with public health control measures supported by national and international authorities has clearly helped to bring SARS under control. The public health significance of such potent symbols as the face mask may be considered in strategies to tackle other emerging infections.

    / Facemask - differences to East West
    quote !a = One of the differences apparent between the response to SARS in the East and the West has been perceptions on the use and value of masks as means of personal protection against the infection.

    / Facemask as a symbol
    quote !b = the mask became to SARS what the condom symbolised for HIV/AIDS.

    / Recommendation: Perception of general public and facemask use
    quote !c = Efforts to improve perception of public health risks can assist the management of major communicable disease incidents by empowering the general public and strengthening perceptions of personal control. Active and empowered involvement of the general public in implementing and cooperating with public health control measures supported by national and international authorities has clearly helped to bring SARS under control. Perhaps it is this perception of the importance of personal and collective responsibility by members of the public that the mask symbolises best and the public health contribution of this symbolism should be remembered for future emerging infections.

    head = We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non–fit-tested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. We concluded that household use of masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective in controlling seasonal ILI.

    >>> Abstract
      Many countries are stockpiling face masks for use as a nonpharmaceutical intervention to control virus transmission during an influenza pandemic. We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non–fit-tested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. Mask use adherence was self-reported. During the 2006 and 2007 winter seasons, 286 exposed adults from 143 households who had been exposed to a child with clinical respiratory illness were recruited. We found that adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk for ILI-associated infection, but <50% of participants wore masks most of the time. We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease. However, during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced. Many countries are stockpiling face masks for use as nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce viral transmission during an influenza pandemic. We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non–fit-tested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. During the 2006 and 2007 winter seasons, 286 exposed adults from 143 households who had been exposed to a child with clinical respiratory illness were recruited. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the relative risk of ILI in the mask use groups compared with the control group; however, <50% of those in the mask use groups reported wearing masks most of the time. Adherence to mask use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ILI-associated infection. We concluded that household use of masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective in controlling seasonal ILI. If adherence were greater, mask use might reduce transmission during a severe influenza pandemic.

    head = There must be pathophysiological reason why “cold” viruses like SARS-CoV-2 show proclivity to nasal cavity, oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity and upper airways which have lower temperature than core body temperature. Henceforth, facemasks’ “therapeutic” role against SARS-CoV-2 must be explored because personal “therapeutic” environments may get created under facemasks due to rebreathing of ~95°F “hot” and ~80% “humid” exhalations which may constantly mitigate SARS-CoV-2 inside nasal cavity, oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity and upper airways.

  // Testing the Efficacy of Homemade Masks: Would They Protect in an Influenza Pandemic?
  doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1017%2Fdmp.2013.43
  ref '!a

    head = This study examined homemade masks as an alternative to commercial face masks. Methods: Several household materials were evaluated for the capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols. Twenty-one healthy volunteers made their own face masks from cotton t-shirts; the masks were then tested for fit. The number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask, a surgical mask, or no mask was compared using several air-sampling techniques. Results: The median-fit factor of the homemade masks was one-half that of the surgical masks. Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers, although the surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.

  // Estimating the Extent of True Asymptomatic Covid-19 and Its Potential for Community Transmission: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
  doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3586675
  ref 'Byambasuren_et_al_2020
    head = The prevalence of true asymptomatic Covid-19 cases is critical to policy makers considering the effectiveness of mitigation measures against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to synthesise all available research on the asymptomatic rates. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID 19 trials, and European PMC for pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv, Research Square, and F1000 Research. We screened 571 articles and included five studies from three countries that include 599 Covid-19 cases and 9,297 contacts. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 6% to 41%. Conclusion: Our meta-analytic estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic Covid-19 cases are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still substantial. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.
