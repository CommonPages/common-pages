  head = How does Covid-19 spread in Public spaces? And what do we need to be aware of?

    nCov-2 is known to spread primarily by inhalation on direct contact with the droplets (Singhal 2020). This can happen in multiple modes ranging from touching infected surfaces and the face or by directly being in close proximity to an infected patient. The droplets of various sizes are released not only by symptomatic patients when they sneeze and cough but also by asymptomatic patients (Kimball et al. 2020; Tobolowsky et al. 2020) in close proximity during normal speech. How infective these droplets depend on various factors and the specifics are yet to be conclusively agreed upon by the researchers. For example, the viral load of the droplet depending on the host state;
    size of the droplets and the range of the physical distance till which they can spread

    Duration of the live (active) state of the virus on various surfaces
    The environment conditions like airflow, temperature and humidity
    There have been generic guidelines to many to wear masks (capable of not letting the virus and droplets to spread out), and maintaining a social distance of about 6 feet/2m from each other, and frequent washing of hands (preemptively to avoid spread when we touch an infected surface and then the face).
    The transmission can happen in and out of the household (Xu et al. 2020). A typical individual in the society involved in a lot of physical transactions with others like travelling, shopping, working etc, and a lack of clarity on the nature of the virus and its transmission has almost put the entire societies at standstill, and online modes of interaction have been only secure modes. However, given the state of the vaccine and drug research, it is imperative that we start considering the reopening most of these activities. Even online packages and currency notes have been found to be potential carriers of some amount of viral RNA to a particular duration.
    However we need to be extremely careful, as most of the transmission of the disease has been primarily due to regular activities ranging from restaurants, hospitals, conferences, gyms and dance studios, religious gatherings etc some of them becoming super-spreader events. Various guidelines and protocols for these activities and reopening of the public spaces are being developed by authorities like CDC in consultation with the researchers; these range from different operational protocols for disinfecting commonly used surfaces etc to potential structural and systemic changes in the way we have been transacting in the societies.
