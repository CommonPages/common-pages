# blood viral RNA,
// Detectable 2019-nCoV viral RNA in blood is a strong indicator for the further clinical severity
doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1732837
ref 'Chen_et_al_2020
  head = We find that the presence of viral RNA in the blood and anal swab is positively correlated with the severe disease stage and that early monitoring of virus RNA in blood and the digestive tract on top of the respiratory tract might benefit the disease prediction.

  >>> Abstract
    The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites.

  let !a self assert = Serial samples (throat swabs, sputum, urine, and stool) from two patients in Beijing were collected daily after their hospitalisation (patient 1, days 3–12 post-onset; patient 2, days 4–15 post-onset). These samples were examined by an N-gene-specific quantitative RT-PCR assay, as described elsewhere.  The viral loads in throat swab and sputum samples peaked at around 5–6 days after symptom onset, ranging from around 104 to 107 copies per mL during this time (figure A, B). This pattern of changes in viral load is distinct from the one observed in patients with SARS, which normally peaked at around 10 days after onset. Sputum samples generally showed higher viral loads than throat swab samples. No viral RNA was detected in urine or stool samples from these two patients.

  / February, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !b self assert = We also studied respiratory samples (nasal [n=1] and throat swabs [n=67], and sputum [n=42]) collected from 80 individuals at different stages of infection. The viral loads ranged from 641 copies per mL to 1·34 × 1011 copies per mL, with a median of 7·99 × 104 in throat samples and 7·52 × 105 in sputum samples

  / February, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !c self assert = The only nasal swab tested in this study (taken on day 3 post-onset) showed a viral load of 1·69 × 105 copies per mL. Overall, the viral load early after onset was high (>1 × 106 copies per mL). However, a sputum sample collected on day 8 post-onset from a patient who died had a very high viral load (1·34 × 1011 copies per mL)

  / February, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !d self assert = Notably, two individuals, who were under active surveillance because of a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed positive results on RT-PCR a day before onset, suggesting that infected individuals can be infectious before them become symptomatic.

  / February, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !e self assert = Among the 30 pairs of throat swab and sputum samples available, viral loads were significantly correlated between the two sample types for days 1–3 (R2=0·50, p=0·022), days 4–7 (R2=0·93, p<0·001), and days 7–14 (R2=0·95, p=0·028).

  / February, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !f self assert = From 17 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with available data (representing days 0–13 after onset), stool samples from nine (53%; days 0–11 after onset) were positive on RT-PCR analysis. Although the viral loads were less than those of respiratory samples (range 550 copies per mL to 1·21 × 105 copies per mL), precautionary measures should be considered when handling faecal samples.



#  Viral Load Kinetics, Korea, first two confirmed patients, epidemic?
// Viral Load Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in First Two Patients in Korea
doi: https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e86
ref 'xyz_et_al_2006
  head =  We report a unique pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics in URT and LRT specimens from first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea. This report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.

  >>> Abstract
    As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated. However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown. This report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.

  let !a self assert = In Patient 1, we observed one example of moderate disease (shortness of breath and oxygen requirement up to 10 L/min) with corresponding radiograph findings and viral loads.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !b self assert = First, unlike SARS-CoV infection,8 we found that viral load was highest during the early phase of the illness (3–5 days from first symptom onset, fever and myalgia were the only symptoms in Patient 1) and continued to decrease until the end of the second week. While she developed cough as well as shortness of breath and infiltration appeared on CXR at the end of first week of illness, the viral load already started to decrease at this phase. This may have a very important implication to determine the optimal time point for antiviral treatment intervention to prevent progression to severe disease.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !c self assert = Second, the virus was detected from LRT specimens even before the development of LRT symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, and oxygen requirement) or visible infiltration on CXR. This may suggest that although the patient does not complain of any LRT symptoms, the virus is already there and causing insidious pathology, ultimately leading to LRT symptoms and chest infiltration later. However, the viral load starts to decrease in both URT and LRT specimens at the same time, which may puzzle the clinicians.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !d self assert = Third, unlike in MERS-CoV revealing higher concentration of virus in LRT specimens, viral loads were similar in both URT and LRT specimens.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !e self assert = Fourth, low concentration of genetic materials, especially E gene, was detected in urine and stool from the end of the first week until the patient recovered from the infection. However, rRT-PCR results did not meet the criteria for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Further studies need to be performed in non-respiratory specimens such as urine and stool samples.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !f self assert = In Patient 2, we observed one example of mild disease with corresponding radiograph findings and viral loads. First, even in a patient with mild disease (sore throat only), visible infiltration on CXR was observed at the end of second week. Second, even in a patient with mild disease, if visible infiltration on CXR is observed, virus is still detected in both URT and LRT specimens even at the end of second week after symptom onset. Viral loads of URT were similar with and sometimes higher than LRT specimens, and virus was detectable for longer period in URT specimen. This could be also probably because the patient did not have significant cough and had little amount of spontaneous sputum insufficient for testing.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !g self assert = In patient 2, the initial test was performed on day 14 of symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both URT and LRT specimens. However, the initial viral loads were relatively lower (49,047 copies/mL for URT and 391,243 copies/mL for LRT) than those of Patient 1 (46,971,053 copies/mL for URT and 9,171,220 copies/mL for LRT) in whom the test was performed on day 2 of symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 was detected a few more times during hospitalization from both URT and LRT specimens at low levels.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !h self assert = From D18 (URT specimen) and D20 (LRT specimen), rRT-PCR became undetectable for two consecutive days, respectively. On day 25, RdRp (Ct value of 36.69) and E (Ct value of 33.18) genes was detected again from the URT sample of day 25, it was interpreted as negative due to high Ct value of RdRp gene.

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !i self assert = From his plasma and stool specimens, only E genes were once detected on day 17 and it was also interpreted as negative result. His CXR improved from day 19 and he was discharged on day 27 (February 5, 2020).

  / February, 2020 - J Korean Med Sci.
  let !j self assert = Lopinavir/ritonavir was used in both patients on day 5 and day 17 from symptom onset, but its role cannot be determined in viral load reduction or clinical improvement. In addition, since they received Lopinavir/ritonavir which can also cause diarrhea, how much of gastrointestinal tract symptom was in fact related to SARS-CoV-2 or drug side effect.

# epidemic, USA, illness severity-correlates to infectivity, close contact
// First mildly ill, non-hospitalized case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without viral transmission in the United States—Maricopa County, Arizona,
doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa374
ref 'Scott_et_al_2020
  head = We summarize the public health investigation, contact tracing, and serial SARS-CoV-2 testing results of the first mildly ill, non-hospitalized U.S. case of COVID-19. Among 16 identified contacts, 10 with high-risk contact did not demonstrate viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on serial SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 6 contacts who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 did not develop any symptom consistent with COVID-19 during post-exposure symptom monitoring. Notably, 1 contact had intimate contact with the case for >36 hours while his clinical specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild illness with a relatively high viral load, and not transmit the infection to close contacts. This case investigation suggests COVID-19 illness severity could correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

  >>> Background
    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity. Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China.

  >>> Methods
    The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (≥10 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2.

  >>> Results
    Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), ≥1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative.

  >>> Conclusions
    This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.

  let !a self assert = In this interview, the patient stated that his cough started in mid-December 2019, prior to travel to China, not 2 days before diagnosis as previously reported. His cough was unchanged in character, frequency, and severity at any time during the illness. He denied all additional symptoms, including fever, chills, and shortness of breath. After diagnostic specimen collection on January 22, the case had paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 different time points. In 8 pairs (73%) the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen tested positive or indeterminate; 3 (27%) tested negative.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !b self assert = The initial respiratory specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 1 had relatively low Ct values (26.7–28.1 in the oropharyngeal specimen and 31.7–32.8 in the sputum specimen), which suggest higher levels of virus in these specimens, despite the patient’s mild illness. Ct values in specimens collected after symptom resolution, on illnessdays 12, 14, 16, 18, and 22, were >35, suggesting decreasing levels of virus in these specimens.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !c self assert = On February 5, the patient reported his cough had resolved. On February 19, 14 days after symptom resolution, CDC confirmed the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at 2 consecutive time points ≥24 hours apart and he was released from voluntary isolation.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !d self assert = Sixteen contacts were identified. Eleven (69%) had high-risk exposure: 5 rideshare drivers, 3 healthcare personnel, 2 housemates, and 1 intimate contact. Five (31%) healthcare personnel had medium-risk exposure. The intimate contact had stayed with the patient for >36 hours before positive diagnostic testing results were received. All 35 paired specimens (100%) collected from contacts with high-risk exposure tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. On February 3, after the intimate contact’s first specimen tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the intimate contact was placed in voluntary quarantine in separate housing to prevent possible ongoing exposure

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !e self assert =  This investigation demonstrates that a mildly symptomatic individual can have a relatively high viral load and still not transmit the infection to an intimate contact. The case had repeated intimate contact with one person over >36 hours while testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case differs from cases reported in Chicago, Illinois and San Benito County, California, where viral transmission occurred between intimate contacts prior to diagnosis and index cases had more severe illnesses, requiring hospitalization. We hypothesize this could be because the virus is nonviable, but this cannot be confirmed without viral culture data.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !f self assert = Of 16 contacts, 3 (19%) developed a cough during the 14-day post-exposure monitoring period and were considered “persons under investigation” per CDC guidance until clinical specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. By March 5, all 16 contacts completed 14-day post-exposure symptom monitoring periods.

  >>> Importance
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.

  >>> Objective
    To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.

  >>> Design, Setting, and Participants
    Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.

Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.

  >>> Conclusions and Relevance
    Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.

  let !a self assert = Between January 23 and February 3, 2020, 18 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed in Singapore, with symptom onset from January 14 to January 30, 2020. All patients reported travel to Wuhan, China, in the 14 days prior to illness onset. Four patients (22%) were identified through contact tracing, while 3 (17%) were identified through border screening. Of the 18 patients, 16 (89%) were Chinese nationals, while 2 (11%) were Singapore residents. There were 5 clusters comprising family, traveling companions, or other close contacts. Contact tracing of the 18 patients identified a total of 264 close contacts in Singapore. As of February 25, 2020, no infections had been detected among health care workers involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.

  let !b self assert = Fever (13 [72%]), cough (15 [83%]), and sore throat (11 [61%]) were common symptoms. Rhinorrhea was infrequent (1 [6%]), while 6 patients (33%) had an abnormal chest radiograph finding or lung crepitations. No patients presented with a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only 1 required immediate supplemental oxygen. Lymphopenia (<1.1 ×109/L) was present in 7 of 16 patients (39%) and an elevated C-reactive protein level (>20 mg/L) in 6 of 16 (38%), while kidney function remained normal.

  / March, 2020 - JAMA network
  let !c self assert = The clinical course was uncomplicated for 12 patients (67%), but 6 patients (33%) desaturated and required supplemental oxygen. Chest radiographs showed no pulmonary opacities at presentation in 12 patients (67%) and remained clear throughout the acute illness in 9 (50%). Three patients with initially normal chest radiograph findings developed bilateral diffuse airspace opacities; of these, 2 had been persistently febrile for more than 1 week. Two individuals (11%) required admission to the intensive care unit because of increasing supplemental oxygen requirements, and 1 (6%) required mechanical ventilation. No concomitant bacterial or viral infections were detected, and there were no deaths as of February 25, 2020.

  let !d self assert = Of the 6 patients who required supplemental oxygen, 5 received lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of 5 patients (60%), initiation of lopinavir-ritonavir was followed by a reduction in supplemental oxygen requirements within 3 days, and viral shedding in nasopharyngeal swabs cleared within 2 days of treatment for 2 of 5 (40%). Two patients, however, deteriorated and experienced progressive respiratory failure while receiving lopinavir-ritonavir, with 1 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Virus continued to be detected by nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal tube aspirate for these 2 patients for the duration of their admission to intensive care.

  let !e self assert = Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results. Five patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir within 1 to 3 days of desaturation, but evidence of clinical benefit was equivocal. While defervescence occurred within 1 to 3 days of lopinavir-ritonavir initiation, it was unable to prevent progressive disease in 2 patients.

  / March, 2020 - JAMA network
  let !f self assert = Median duration of viral shedding from first to last positive nasopharyngeal swab collected as part of clinical care was 12 days (range, 1-24), and 15 patients (83%) had viral shedding from the nasopharynx detected for 7 days or longer.

  let !g self assert = The time course of serial cycle threshold values by day of illness for 12 patients not receiving supplemental oxygen and 6 patients receiving supplemental oxygen (of whom 5 were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir) appeared similar. Decline in viral load as indicated by the cycle threshold value from nasopharyngeal swabs also appeared similar between those treated and not treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. The effectiveness of lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 needs to be examined in an outbreak randomized trial, given a lack of clear signal in this small case series.

  / March, 2020 - JAMA network
  let !h self assert = Virus was detected by PCR in stool (4/8 patients [50%]) and in whole blood (1/12 [8%]); virus was not detected in urine (0/10 samples). Viral culture results were not available at the time of writing to determine the viability of virus detected outside the respiratory tract.

  / March, 2020 - JAMA network
  let !i self assert = Sequences for phylogenetic analysis were available for 6 viruses. All clustered together with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries and are available in public databases.

  / March, 2020 - JAMA network
  let !j self assert = In this study, viral load in nasopharyngeal samples from patients with COVID-19 peaked within the first few days after symptom onset before declining. The duration of viral shedding from nasopharyngeal aspirates was prolonged up to at least 24 days after symptom onset. This was longer than reported from a comparable series from China. Toward the end of this period virus was only intermittently detected from nasopharyngeal swabs. It is unclear whether this is attributable to biological differences in the intensity of shedding or to sampling variability when low amounts of virus are present. Determining whether the virus remains transmissible throughout the period of detectability is critical to control efforts.

ref 'Xu_et_al_2020
  head = This study is the first to document the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the respiratory tract among a cohort of patients with COVID-19. We found that the median duration from onset of symptoms to RNA clearance was 17 days. Male sex, delayed hospital admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. These results reinforce guidance that hospital admission and treatments should be started as soon as possible in patients with COVID-19. Male patients need particular attention to prolonged viral RNA shedding, which might be associated with poor treatment outcomes. Understanding the virological dynamics during the process of illness should be helpful in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.

  >>> Background
    An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a public health emergency. Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.

  >>> Methods
    In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from 2 hospitals outside Wuhan.

  >>> Results
    The median (interquartile range) duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 (13–22) days as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (≥15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (P = .001), severe illness at admission (P = .049), invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006), and corticosteroid treatment (P = .025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (P < .001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (P < .001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.31–8.02), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10–1.54), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11–88.02) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

  >>> Conclusions
    Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Hospital admission and general treatments should be started as soon as possible in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially male patients.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !b self assert = When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (≥15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009). The proportion of patients with severe disease at admission in the group with prolonged shedding was significantly higher than that in the group with early viral RNA clearance (34.2% vs 16.2%, P = .049). Corticosteroid (P = .025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006) treatments were related to prolonged viral RNA shedding time.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !c self assert = Prolonged RNA shedding was associated with delayed recovery on radiological imaging (median days, 12 vs 16; P < .001), delayed recovery of body temperature (median days, 7 vs 11; P < .001), and prolonged hospital stay (median days, 13.5 vs 22; P < .001). More patients recovered and were released by 21 days after illness onset (91.9% vs 46.1%, P = .023) in the group with early viral RNA clearance than in the group with prolonged viral RNA shedding.

  let !e self assert = The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 15 days (IQR, 12–17 days) in the female group and 18.5 days (IQR, 15–25 days) in the male group (P = .013). The proportion of patients with severe disease at admission in the male group (37.9%) was significantly higher than that in the female group (14.9%, P = .010). The median length of hospital stay was longer in the male group than in the female group (median days, 15 vs 22; P = .002). The cumulative probability of viral negative conversion was slightly higher in the female group than that in the male group (P = .043)

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !f self assert = Early (≤5 days) versus later (>5 days) hospital admission was significantly associated with viral RNA clearance speed (P = .004). Late hospital admission was associated with a higher proportion of patients with severe disease at admission (43.4% vs 15.0%, P = .001) and a higher frequency of critically severe illness during hospitalization (30.2% vs 11.7%, P = .019) than was early hospital admission. Our findings also suggest that symptomatic patients should be admitted to the hospital as early as possible if SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed. Delayed hospital admission was associated with more severe conditions at admission and worse treatment outcomes.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !g self assert = SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11–88.02; P = .04) compared with those who did not undergo invasive mechanical ventilation.

  let !h self assert = The smoking rates were comparable between the early-clearance group and the prolonged-shedding group in this study.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !i self assert = There was a higher percentage of patients with hypertension in the prolonged-viral-RNA-shedding group than in the early-clearance group; however, hypertension was not a significant risk factor in the logistic regression model. Thus, it was suggested that sex itself is the influencing factor of disease progression.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !j self assert = In our study, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-α were the most frequently used antiviral regimens. It was hard to evaluate the efficacy of these 2-drug combination because of the lack of controls.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !k self assert = Corticosteroid usage was related to prolonged viral RNA shedding time in this report as well, as patients with early RNA clearance had lower proportion of patients using corticosteroid compared with patients with late RNA clearance (40.5% vs 64.5%, P = .025). However, this difference can be influenced by disease severity, as patients who were given corticosteroids usually had more severe disease than those who did not. Furthermore, corticosteroid use was not found to be an independent risk factor for prolonged viral RNA shedding in the multivariable model conducted in this report. Thus, a definitive conclusion that corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding duration in patients with COVID-19 cannot be drawn. The reason for the inconsistent results might be that the corticosteroid doses in this report were relatively low (0.5–1 mg methylprednisolone/kg body weight) for patients with COVID-19.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !l self assert = Invasive mechanical ventilator support was found to be another important independent predictor of prolonged viral RNA shedding. Another potential reason for prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding is the emergence of drug resistance during antiviral treatment, since most of the patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation had a longer hospital stay.

  head = Characterization of the first 12 COVID-19 patients identified in the United States provides insight into the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although duration of infectiousness is unclear, these early data show viable virus can be cultured readily from upper respiratory tract specimens soon after illness onset; further studies on infectious period and risk factors for transmission are needed. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness, but appropriate monitoring of these patients will present challenges as healthcare systems work to meet the increasing demands.

  >>> Abstract
    Data on the detailed clinical progression of COVID-19 in conjunction with epidemiological and virological characteristics are limited. In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously. Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing. Median age was 53 years (range: 21–68); 8 patients were male. Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2–3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.

  let !a self assert = Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). The most commonly reported initial signs or symptoms were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7) (Table 1). Two patients reported neither fever nor cough initially, though they developed them subsequently: one reported sore throat as their initial symptom and the other reported diarrhea (one day before fever and cough); the patient with diarrhea had recently traveled outside the United States before illness onset and later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes difficile.

  let !b self assert = Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. All hospitalized patients had oxygen saturation <94% on room air at some point during their illness, with oxygen saturation nadir (range: 86–93%) occurring at a median of illness day 12 (range: 4–23) (Fig. 2). Five patients reported difficulty in breathing and four received supplemental oxygen. Patient 9 required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation and intensive care monitoring. No patients required mechanical ventilation.

  let !g self assert = Six of seven hospitalized patients had leukopenia (<4,000 cells per µl) and the white blood cell count nadir occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4–15) (Fig. 2). Procalcitonin levels were <0.25 ng ml−1 in all six patients tested. Aminotransferase levels were elevated in all hospitalized patients: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels peaked (median peak value 129 U l−1, range 46–190 U l−1) at a median of illness day 13 (range 7–19) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels peaked (median peak value 136 U l−1, range 66–389 U l−1) at a median of illness day 14 (range: 6–23).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7 of 12 patients, including in NP (n = 6), OP (n = 3), sputum (n = 1) and stool (n = 3) specimens. Home isolation or Transmission-Based Precautions were discontinued for all patients per CDC criteria4; the last respiratory specimens tested at CDC with a positive test result were collected from these patients on days 8–36 (median = day 19).

  let !p self assert = Complete genome sequences were generated from respiratory specimens from all 12 patients. The sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes; phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups (Extended Data Fig. 9) that were not divergent from each other, suggesting that these patients were identified during an early stage of the outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis from these 12 patients’ respiratory tract specimens support a recent zoonotic transmission event and subsequent human-to-human transmission.

  let !q self assert = The highest viral RNA levels in the upper respiratory tract were typically detected in the first week of illness, and viable SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. Viral RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution for seven patients, although the implications for infectiousness and transmission later in illness are unclear.

  / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
  let !r self assert =  Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or laboratory signs of worsening including hypoxemia or elevation of aminotransferases. Although some patients received empiric antibiotics for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia, we found definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection. Worsening in the second week of illness is consistent with previous reports, and highlights the importance of close monitoring beyond the first week, even in patients with mild illness or no initial radiographic abnormalities.

  / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
  let !s self assert = Patient 9, the most severely ill among this series, experienced clinical deterioration late in the second week of illness. This was the only patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in serum and detection in serum was temporally related to clinical deterioration. Similar observations have been described previously

  / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
  let !t self assert = We detected viral RNA and cultured virus from upper respiratory specimens, even from patients with predominantly lower respiratory tract illness. Ct values in upper respiratory tract specimens typically were lowest during the first week of illness (suggesting high RNA levels), consistent with previous reports. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper respiratory tract specimens for 2–3 weeks in most patients and for as long as 36 d. Sputum specimens were less frequently available; in two patients with a productive cough and available sputum, viral RNA was detected in sputum longer than in NP or OP specimens. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool of multiple patients and in the serum of one hospitalized patient.

ref 'Yuan_et_al_2020
  head = According to our study, it is probably that two negative RT-PCR tests 24 hours apart may not be sufficient for viral clearance evaluation. Repeated viral RT-PCR testing separated by prolonged duration like 48 hours is essential to assure that virus has actually cleared and the discharged patients no longer transmitted the virus. On the other hand, we suggest that some immunological parameters such as D-dimer and absolute lymphocyte count, and even antibody test should be combined with RT-PCR negative test as additional measures to assure that infected patients have completely recovered and can be released from quarantine.

  >>> Abstract
    We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge. We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration (r= -0.637; p=0.002) and time to virus recrudescence (r= 0.52; p=0.008) respectively, suggesting the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in COVID-19 patients.

// Profile of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary study from 56 COVID-19 patients

ref 'Xiao_et_al_2020
  head = This study is the first case series from 56 COVID-19 patients with 299 samples of RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our preliminary results are notable for providing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 dynamic profile in patients infected. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients. We conclude that longer periods of follow up and repeat testing are necessary to limit viral spread.

    A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic threatens the world. Here, we first studied the dynamics profile of SARS-CoV-2 from 56 recovered COVID-19 patients. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients.

  let !a self assert =  We studied RT-qPCR results from 56 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Each patient received four to seven tests over several weeks after symptom onset. In first 3 weeks after symptoms onset, majority results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. From week 3 after symptoms onset, number of negative RT-PCR results increased. All results of RT-PCR tests were negative in week 6 after onset. The positive rate of RT-PCR test results was highest at week 1 (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and 0% at week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5 and week 6 respectively.

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !b self assert = The longest duration between RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was 42 days after onset of symptoms. The median duration between onset of symptom to nucleic acid conversion was 24 days (IQR, 18-31)

  / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !c self assert =  We divided patients into non-prolonged and prolonged shedding group according to nucleic acid conversion time (≤24 days or >24 days). Patients with prolonged viral shedding tend to be older (p=0.011) and were more likely to have comorbidities as diabetes (p=0.016) and hypertension (p=0.006).

  let !e self assert = This preliminary study has found evidence of the dynamic profile of SARSCoV-2 in non-ICU COVID-19 patients during disease course. According to the results in our study, we suggested prolonged observation and repeat confirmation of RT-PCR test from respiratory specimens for safe discharges and discontinuation of quarantine.

ref 'Tom_et_al_2020
  head =  Currently, diagnosis, screening, and surveillance depend on a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) test and results are generally reported to the ordering physician as positive or negative. However, the test does provide a measure of the viral load in the sample, in what is called the cycle threshold (Ct) value. We suggest that reporting this Ct value, or a calculate viral load, can aid in interpretation and clinical decisions. We discuss the merits of PCR tests and other approaches such as time since symptom resolution based approaches for removing individuals from isolation.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !a self assert = Xiao et al. report that SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR results can remain positive up to five weeks after onset of symptoms. The authors studied RT-qPCR results from 56 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Each patient received four to seven tests over several weeks after symptom onset. The percentage of positive results declined from 100% in week one to 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4%, and 0% in weeks two, three, four, five, and six, respectively. The median time from symptom onset to negative testing was 24 days. Prolonged positive test results were associated with older age and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Additionally, there were four patients with two consecutive negative test results who later tested positive again. A limitation is that the test reports did not report out Ct values, which would have provided valuable information about the amount of viral RNA in the samples, important particularly later in the course of infection.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !b self assert = Prevention (CDC) suggest one of two approaches for discontinuing isolation, one based on time since symptom onset and resolution, and the other centred on two negative tests at least 24 hours apart. The first approach assumes a person is generally no longer transmitting virus 10 days after symptom resolution. This approach is test-sparing and is particularly useful when resources are scarce or in the outpatient setting where repeat testing is onerous. When testing is available, decisions to lift isolation rely heavily on negative PCR tests to define a patient as no longer infectious. However, if a positive PCR test is intended to mean infectivity, then this approach may not be optimal. Closer examination of what the test results mean clinically, particularly when results are from RNA quantities near the lower limit of detection of the assay, could help guide clinical and public health strategies.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !c self assert = The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test provides real-time quantification by first reverse transcribing SARS-CoV-2 RNA into DNA (RT step), and then performing qPCR where a fluorescence signal increases proportionally to the amount of amplified nucleic acid, enabling accurate quantitation of the RNA in the sample. If the fluorescence reaches a specified threshold within a certain number of PCR cycles (Ct value), the sample is considered a positive result. The Ct value is inversely related to the viral load and every ~3.3 increase in the Ct value reflects a 10-fold reduction in starting material. Many qPCR assays involve a Ct cutoff of 40 to consider the test positive, allowing detection of very few starting RNA molecules.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !d self assert = This high sensitivity for viral RNA can be helpful for initial diagnosis. However, reporting as a binary positive or negative result removes useful information that could inform clinical decision making.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !e self assert =  Following complete resolution of symptoms, people can have prolonged positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR test results, potentially for weeks, as Xiao et al report. At these late time points,the Ct value is often very high, representing presence of very low copies of viral RNA. In these cases, where viral RNA copies in the sample may be fewer than 100, results are reported to the clinician simply as positive. This leaves the clinician with little choice but to interpret the results no differently than for a sample from someone who is floridly positive and where RNA copies routinely reach 100 million or more.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !f self assert = A positive RT-qPCR result may not necessarily mean the person is still infectious or that they still have any meaningful disease. First, the RNA could be from nonviable or killed virus. Live virus is often isolable only during the first week of symptoms but not after day 8, even with positive RT-qPCR tests. Second, there may need to be a minimum amount of viable virus for onward transmission.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !g self assert =  For infection control purposes, the utility of the assay is greatest when identifying people who are floridly positive and at risk of further transmission. Particularly when testing in the absence of symptoms for COVID-19, we believe that reporting the Ct value or range could help to better inform clinical decisions.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !h self assert = We propose that for inpatients whose symptoms have fully resolved and two tests over 24 hours apart are either negative or close to the Ct cutoff (i.e. Ct >34), they likely do not have meaningful or transmissible disease, and thus do not need to be retested. This would conserve valuable testing capacity, reagents, and PPE.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !i self assert =  Furthermore, the clinician could take the Ct results in context and determine when the patient can discontinue isolation. This could shorten duration of isolation and for healthcare workers and other essential workers would provide a more evidence-based, testing-informed pathway for more rapid return to work. Taking the Ct value into account may also help justify symptom-based strategies recommended by the CDC including time-since-illness-onset and time-since-symptom-resolution based approaches (i.e.lifting of isolation after ten days following resolution of symptoms.)

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !j self assert = Lastly, there may be implications for public health screening, enabling contact tracers to focus on persons most likely to be infectious. This will become increasingly important as asymptomatic screening expands.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !k self assert = The Ct value could be high as a result of early disease and the Ct value would have to be considered in clinical context. A person with a high Ct value tested early in the disease course might be or become infectious and this would present as a significant decrease in Ct value 24 hours following the first test.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !l self assert = A patient with resolved symptoms and two Ct values both close to the cutoff is likely recovering and no longer infectious. Evidence from both viral isolation and contact tracing studies support a short, early period of transmissibility.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !m self assert = By accounting for the Ct value in context, RT-qPCR results can be used in a way that is personalized, highly sensitive, and also more specific.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !n self assert = To implement this, the actual Ct values could be reported along with reference ranges or converted to viral load and or categorized as high, medium, or low.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !o self assert = Repeat testing over 24 hours is not always feasible and is always resource heavy when testing islimited. Time since symptom onset or time since symptom resolution based approaches may be as or more useful in many situations. As more detailed data emerge and provide increased certainty about the length of infectivity, there may be discussion about shifting entirely to these time-based criteria.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !p self assert = As long as resource limitations in testing and PPE exist, we believe that time-since symptom resolution and test-based strategies should continue to coexist and complement one another. Healthcare workers, who may have easier access to testing and who may be most crucial to get back to work quicker might benefit by test-based clearance, particularly if the Ct value is considered.

  / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !q self assert = For both of these approaches, it should be recognized that certain populations may tend to remain infectious for longer. Xiao et al. showed that older patients were more likely to have prolonged positive results and presumably longer infectivity. Severe disease is also a risk factor for longer viral shedding. Larger studies that account for potential confounding are necessary to determine viral shedding dynamics in different populations, including those who are immunocompromised or treated with immunomodulatory agents. For now, test-based clearance may be preferred for these patients. Having both time- and test-based guidelines enables clinicians to select based on the patient and setting.

  let !a self assert = Soon after its introduction in Europe in the 1920s, epidemiological studies reported that BCG vaccination strongly reduced infant mortality, and this could not be explained by a reduction in tuberculosis alone. Later on, similar studies in other locations, including randomized controlled trials, showed an up to 50% reduction of mortality induced by BCG in young infants. This reduction in childhood mortality by BCG appeared to be due to the protection against unrelated infectious agents and especially respiratory tract infections and neonatal sepsis. Although the authors did not discriminate between bacterial and viral infections in these studies, it is well known that viral pathogens are the main cause of respiratory tract infections in children.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !b self assert = This hypothesis was strengthened by a study in Guinea-Bissau showing that BCG reduced the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus infection. A similar protective effect of BCG on respiratory tract infections was found in older individuals in Indonesia, and a clinical trial performed in Japan demonstrated protection against pneumonia in tuberculin-negative older individuals. Last, a recent study in adolescents in South Africa also reported a 70% reduction of respiratory tract infections by BCG vaccination

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !c self assert = Spencer et al. showed that BCG reduced viral titres of influenza A virus in mice, an effect dependent on macrophages. BCG vaccination also protected from herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) in a controlled infection model with newborn mice, while subcutaneous administration of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of the mycobacterial cell wall, protected against vaccinia virus and HSV2 infections in mice. This effect was mediated by peritoneal macrophages, suggesting strong effects of BCG on the innate immune component of host defence. In line with this, a recent murine study showed that intravenous BCG delivery led to increased cytokine production by both splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages upon ex vivo restimulation with various unrelated pathogens.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !d self assert = BCG vaccination of healthy human volunteers results in enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6, when monocytes from these individuals are stimulated ex vivo with unrelated pathogens. Interestingly, these effects are accompanied by transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of the myeloid cells in the BCG-vaccinated individuals. The epigenetic changes are manifested as chemical modifications (methylation and acetylation) of the histone, resulting in enhanced chromatin accessibility, easier transcription of genes important for antimicrobial responses and improved cell function. In addition, metabolic reprogramming leads to selective accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites that regulate this process, owing to their function as cofactors for several classes of enzymes that mediate the epigenetic changes.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !e self assert = It has been hypothesized that induction of trained immunity is at least partly the mechanism through which BCG vaccination induces its beneficial effects. The idea here is that BCG leads to epigenetically trained populations of monocytes and/or natural killer cells, which most likely reside in the bone marrow. Upon challenge with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; which could be from bacteria or viruses) these innate immune cells then show an enhanced response, promoting host defence. This might explain why a vaccine for tuberculosis leads to protection against multiple pathogens.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !f self assert = In a recent study in healthy human volunteers, it has been shown that BCG vaccination reduces viraemia in response to the yellow fever vaccine (which is a live attenuated vaccine). This response is associated with epigenetic changes in monocytes that correlate with improved antiviral responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that the induction of trained immunity by BCG vaccination results in significant protection against multiple viral infection

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !g self assert = On the basis of these data, it has been hypothesized that BCG vaccination might be a potent preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or may reduce COVID-19 disease severity. Ecological studies have suggested that countries and regions that mandate BCG vaccination for the population have a lower number of infections and a reduced mortality from COVID-19. While these data could indeed suggest a protective effect of BCG vaccination, such studies cannot provide definitive proof of causality, owing to several inherent biases.These include differences in, one, demographic and genetic structure of the populations in different locations; two, differences in the non-pharmaceutical interventions being adopted in different locations (such as quarantine or social distancing); three, differences in diagnosing and reporting COVID-19 cases; and, four, differences in the positions on the epidemic curve of each location.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !h self assert = Notwithstanding these issues, the link to BCG and COVID-19 from these studies is intriguing. It is not known whether older people would maintain a pool of trained monocytes many years after BCG vaccination. A possible explanation is that children who have been vaccinated with BCG are less susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and so there is less spread of the virus to older populations, although this would need to be demonstrated.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !i self assert = Because of these important limitations, randomized controlled trials are needed to provide the highest quality proof for the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may protect against COVID-19. It is reasonable to propose that these are first initiated in populations at high risk of infection or with a high risk of mortality, such as hospital staff working in close contact with patients with COVID-19 or older individuals.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !j self assert = Trials assessing the efficacy of BCG vaccination in these categories of individuals are currently being performed in the Netherlands, Australia and Greece, while other trials are being planned in the United States, UK, Denmark, France, Uruguay, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !k self assert = One important aspect relates to the boosting of the innate immune response by BCG. Might this be deleterious, considering the fact that an exaggerated cytokine response has been associated with complications in patients with COVID-19? We would argue that in healthy individuals vaccinated with BCG, in which innate antimicrobial mechanisms would be boosted by trained immunity, this is most likely to lead to inhibited viral replication, decreased viral loads and subsequently less inflammation and symptoms. This hypothesis is supported by the decrease in viraemia seen following yellow fever vaccination of individuals who were previously vaccinated with BCG.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !l self assert = By contrast, an initial defective antiviral response in some individuals at high risk (for example, older individuals) can result in high viral loads, stimulation of an inefficient systemic inflammation and severe disease. Breaking the loop of systemic inflammation could have beneficial effects in these patients.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !m self assert = The use of approaches to induce trained immunity for protection against COVID-19 may not be restricted to BCG: indeed, there is speculation that oral polio vaccine might protect against non-related viral infections, and the new recombinant BCG-based vaccine VPM1002 may have similar effects and is also being considered for clinical trials.

  head = For the patient described in the vignette, the most important aspect of care is careful monitoring of his respiratory status to determine whether endotracheal intubation is appropriate. If mechanical ventilation is initiated, the clinician should adhere to a lung-protective ventilation strategy by limiting the plateau pressure and tidal volumes. Deep sedation with neuromuscular blocking agents and prone positioning should be considered if refractory hypoxemia develops. Anticoagulants should be administered to prevent thrombosis. Preliminary data support the use of remdesivir if available. Rigorous adherence to infection-control practices is essential at all times. Given the high risk of complications from severe Covid-19, clinicians should work with patients and families to establish appropriate goals of care at the earliest possible time.

  let !b self assert = The most common initial symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgias, and diarrhea. Severe illness usually begins approximately 1 week after the onset of symptoms. Dyspnea is the most common symptom of severe disease and is often accompanied by hypoxemia. A striking feature of Covid-19 is the rapid progression of respiratory failure soon after the onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !c self assert = Patients with severe Covid-19 commonly meet the criteria for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is defined as the acute onset of bilateral infiltrates, severe hypoxemia, and lung edema that is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. The majority of patients with severe Covid-19 have lymphopenia, and some have disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system. Severe Covid-19 may also lead to acute cardiac, kidney, and liver injury, in addition to cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and shock. These organ failures may be associated with a cytokine release syndrome characterized by high fevers, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and elevation of other inflammatory markers.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !d self assert = For epidemiologic purposes, severe Covid-19 in adults is defined as dyspnea, a respiratory rate of 30 or more breaths per minute, a blood oxygen saturation of 93% or less, a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2:Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg, or infiltrates in more than 50% of the lung field within 24 to 48 hours from the onset of symptoms.

  let !e self assert = In a large cohort of patients with Covid-19, 81% had mild disease, 14% had severe disease, and 5% became critically ill with organ failure; the mortality in the critically ill group was 49%. The majority of critically ill patients with Covid-19 receive prolonged mechanical ventilation.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !f self assert = People with chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are more likely to become critically ill from Covid-19. The incidence of critical illness is also higher among men than among women and higher among persons older than 65 years of age than among younger persons. However, healthy persons of any age can become critically ill with Covid-19. A hallmark of the Covid-19 pandemic is the sudden appearance of an unprecedented number of critically ill patients in a small geographic area.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !g self assert = BASICS OF RESPIRATORY CARE: Patients should be monitored carefully by direct observation and pulse oximetry. Oxygen should be supplemented by the use of a nasal cannula or Venturi mask to keep the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin between 90 and 96%. Deciding whether or not to intubate is a critical aspect of caring for seriously ill patients with Covid-19. Clinicians must weigh the risks of premature intubation against the risk of sudden respiratory arrest with a chaotic emergency intubation, which exposes staff to a greater risk of infection. Signs of excessive effort in breathing, hypoxemia that is refractory to oxygen supplementation, and encephalopathy herald impending respiratory arrest and the need for urgent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is no single number or algorithm that determines the need for intubation, and clinicians must consider a variety of factors.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !h self assert = If the patient does not undergo intubation but remains hypoxemic, a high-flow nasal cannula can improve oxygenation and may prevent intubation in selected patients.18,19 The use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation should probably be restricted to patients with Covid-19 who have respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or obstructive sleep apnea rather than ARDS. However, some experts discourage the use of high-flow nasal cannulae and noninvasive ventilation because these treatments may inappropriately delay recognition of the need for endotracheal intubation and expose clinicians to infectious aerosols.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !i self assert = Having awake patients turn to the prone position while they breathe high concentrations of supplemental oxygen may improve gas exchange in patients with severe Covid-19. This approach is supported by a case series describing its use in nonintubated patients with ARDS unrelated to Covid-19. However, whether prone positioning can prevent intubation in patients with severe Covid-19 is unclear. Because it is difficult to provide rescue ventilation to patients who are prone, this position should be avoided in patients whose condition is rapidly deteriorating.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !j self assert = ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION: If possible, intubation should be performed after preoxygenation and rapid-sequence induction of sedation and neuromuscular blockade. An antiviral filter should be placed in line with the airway circuit at all times. Video laryngoscopy may allow the operator to have a good view of the airway from a greater distance. However, operators should choose the technique that is most likely to be successful on the first attempt. Continuous-wave capnography is the best method to confirm tracheal intubation. Patients with Covid-19 often become hypotensive soon after intubation owing to positive-pressure ventilation and systemic vasodilation from sedatives. Therefore, intravenous fluids and vasopressors should be immediately available at the time of intubation, and careful hemodynamic monitoring is essential.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !k self assert = VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT: To prevent alveolar overdistention, clinicians should limit both the tidal volume delivered by the ventilator and the maximum pressure in the alveoli at the end of inspiration. To do this, clinicians should set the ventilator to deliver a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight; this approach is termed “lung-protective ventilation.” A tidal volume up to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight is allowed if the patient becomes distressed and attempts to take larger tidal volumes.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !l self assert = A few times each day, clinicians should initiate a half-second end-inspiratory pause, which allows the pressure in the airway circuit to equilibrate between the patient and the ventilator. The pressure in the airway circuit at the end of the pause — “the plateau pressure” — approximates the alveolar pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure). To prevent alveolar overdistention, the plateau pressure should not exceed 30 cm of water.19,27 A higher plateau pressure without the development of ventilator-induced lung injury may be possible in patients with central obesity or noncompliant chest walls.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !m self assert = For patients with Covid-19–related ARDS, setting sufficient positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator may prevent alveolar collapse and facilitate the recruitment of unstable lung regions. As a result, PEEP can improve respiratory-system compliance and allow for a reduction in the Fio2. However, PEEP can reduce venous return to the heart and cause hemodynamic instability. Moreover, excessive PEEP can lead to alveolar overdistention and reduce respiratory-system compliance. No particular method of determining the appropriate level of PEEP has been shown to be superior to other methods.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !n self assert = Sedatives and analgesics should be targeted to prevent pain, distress, and dyspnea. They can also be used to blunt the patient’s respiratory drive, which improves patient synchrony with mechanical ventilation. Sedation is especially important in febrile patients with high metabolic rates who are treated with lung-protective ventilation. Neuromuscular blocking agents can be used in deeply sedated patients who continue to use their accessory muscles of ventilation and have refractory hypoxemia. These agents can reduce the work of breathing, which reduces oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Moreover, sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents may help reduce the risk of lung injury that may occur when patients generate strong spontaneous respiratory efforts.

  let !o self assert = REFRACTORY HYPOXEMIA: Clinicians should consider prone positioning during mechanical ventilation in patients with refractory hypoxemia (Pao2:Fio2 of <150 mm Hg during respiration and Fio2 of 0.6 despite appropriate PEEP). In randomized trials involving intubated patients with ARDS (not associated with Covid-19), placing the patient in the prone position for 16 hours per day has improved oxygenation and reduced mortality.18,29 However, prone positioning of patients requires a team of at least three trained clinicians, all of whom require full PPE.

  let !p self assert = Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., inhaled nitric oxide) can also improve oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure, although they do not improve survival in ARDS not associated with Covid-19. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential rescue strategy in patients with refractory respiratory failure. However, ECMO may not be effective owing to the cytokine storm and hypercoagulability of Covid-19, and its use will probably be limited as the pandemic strains resources.

  let !q self assert = SUPPORTIVE CARE: Patients with Covid-19 often present with volume depletion and receive isotonic-fluid resuscitation. Volume repletion helps maintain blood pressure and cardiac output during intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. After the first few days of mechanical ventilation, the goal should be to avoid hypervolemia. Fever and tachypnea in patients with severe Covid-19 often increase insensible water loss, and careful attention must be paid to water balance.

  let !s self assert = In case series, approximately 5% of patients with severe Covid-19 have received renal-replacement therapy; the pathophysiology of the renal failure is currently unclear but is probably multifactorial. Because blood clotting in the circuit is common in patients with severe Covid-19, the efficacy of continuous renal-replacement therapy is uncertain.

  let !t self assert = Abnormalities of the clotting cascade, such as thrombocytopenia and elevation of d-dimer levels, are common in patients with severe Covid-19 and are associated with increased mortality. Prophylactic low-dose heparin should be used to reduce the risk of venous thrombosis. However, in one series of critically ill patients with Covid-19, one third had clinically significant venous or arterial thrombosis despite thromboprophylaxis.38 Life-threatening thrombosis has also occurred despite full-dose anticoagulation with heparins.34 The benefits and risks of more intense anticoagulation or of using direct thrombin inhibitors in patients with severe Covid-19 are unknown.

Antibiotics can be discontinued after a short course if signs of bacterial coinfection, such as leukocytosis and focal pulmonary infiltrates, are absent. Although Covid-19 itself can cause prolonged fever, clinicians should be vigilant for nosocomial infections.

  let !v self assert = Patients with Covid-19 who are receiving mechanical ventilation should receive appropriate nutrition and care to prevent constipation and injury to the skin and corneas. If the condition of a patient has stabilized, clinicians should attempt to withhold continuous sedation each day.

  let !x self assert = The delayed onset of critical illness in patients with Covid-19 suggests a maladaptive host response to infection. Therefore, there is intense interest in the effects of immunomodulating therapies. Glucocorticoids have been used widely for cytokine storm and respiratory failure in patients with Covid-19; however, there is concern that they may prolong viral shedding and lead to secondary infections. Current guidelines offer conflicting advice on the use of glucocorticoids. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests a short course of glucocorticoids for moderate-to-severe ARDS related to Covid-19, whereas the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends their use only in the context of a clinical trial.For reversal of vasopressor-dependent shock in patients with Covid-19, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends low-dose glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg daily by means of infusion or with intermittent dosing).

  let !y self assert = Other immunomodulating agents currently being evaluated for severe Covid-19 include passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma, intravenous immunoglobulin, and interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 pathway inhibition.Pending results of randomized trials, the risks and benefits of these approaches are also unknown. Candidate therapies for Covid-19 warrant evaluation separately in patients with established severe disease and in those with milder illness to determine whether they reduce the risk of progression.

// Full genome viral sequences inform patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and within Israel
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.20104521
ref 'Miller_et_al_2020
  head = Overall, our findings highlight the use of genomic data to effectively track the spread of an emerging virus using phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches that have been developed to study viral outbreaks. We have hereby succeeded in tracking the main transmission chains that led to SARS-CoV-2 spread in Israel, and applied phylodynamic analysis to infer key epidemiological parameters governing its spread. Our results suggest that superspreading events are a main feature of SARS-CoV-2 spread, suggesting that focused measures to reduce contacts of select individuals/social events could dramatically mitigate viral spread. Finally our results highlight how global connectivity allows for massive introductions of a virus, and emphasize how border control and shelter-in-place restrictionsare crucial for halting viral spread.

  >>> Abstract
    Full genome sequences are increasingly used to track the geographic spread and transmission dynamics of viral pathogens. Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. A phylogenetic analysis including thousands of globally sampled sequences allowed us to infer multiple independent introductions into Israel, followed by local transmission. Returning travelers from the U.S. contributed dramatically more to viral spread relative to their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around ~2.0-2.6, dropping by two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. A comparison between reported and model-estimated case numbers indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 1-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings underscore the ability of this virus to efficiently transmit between and within countries, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing its spread.

  let !a self assert = With a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. We found multiple introductions into Israel from both the U.S and Europe, the latter including mainly the U.K., France and Belgium. Over 70% of the clade introductions into Israel (confidence intervals ranging from ~50% to ~80%, see Methods) were inferred to have occurred from the U.S., while the remaining were mainly from Europe. During the entire epidemic in Israel, very close monitoring of all incoming infected travelers was imposed, and reports show that only ~27% of infected returning travelers were from the U.S. Moreover, this suggests that had flights from the U.S. been arrested at the same time that flights from Europe were arrested (between February 26 and March 4, instead of by March 9), a substantial fraction of the transmission chains in Israel would have been prevented.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !b self assert = Super-spreading is a feature of viral spread: Specifically, if we assume almost complete case reporting, our phylodynamic analysis indicates that between 5-9% of infections are responsible for 80% of secondary infections; with lower assumed levels of case reporting, between 1-5% of infections would be responsible for this 80% of secondary infections.

  let !e self assert = A total of 224 unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified between the Wuhanreference sequence and this set of sequences from Israel. Of these SNVs (single nucleotide variants), 141 were non-synonymous, 72 were synonymous, and the remaining 11 were in noncoding regions. One of the most abundantly detected SNVs was a non-synonymous variant D614G found in the spike protein, which was present in 90% of the sequences. This variant has generated much interest as it has been reported to potentially increase the transmissibility of the virus.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !f self assert = We also found five different high confidence genomic deletions, spanning between one and eighteen nucleotides, each of which was found in one to two samples. Three of these five deletions occurred in multiples of three and were in-frame deletions or affected non-coding regions. Of the remaining two deletions, deletion 3 spanned ten nucleotides, and likely prevents the translation of ORF7a. Deletion 4 occurred at the end of ORF8 and causes the replacement of the last amino acid with an additional five amino acids. Notably, an 81 nt in-frame deletion in ORF7a has been previously reported (Holland, et al. 2020), as has been a 382 nt deletion in ORF8, suggesting that the virus is to some extent tolerant to deletions in these ORFs.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !g self assert = When focusing on deletions that occurred in two samples, we noted that the two samples bearing deletion 1 were located in very remote clades on the phylogeny, suggesting that the deletion occurred two independent times. Deletion 5 on the other hand was present in two related samples that were sampled five days apart from each other. Deletions 2, 3 and 4 revealed an intriguing pattern: three independent deletions (one of which was present in two samples) were all part of the same clade that included eighteen samples. One non-synonymous SNV (single nucleotide variants) defined this clade: S2430R in ORF1b which affects the nonstructural protein NSP16. This protein has been reported to be a 2ʹO-methyl-transferase that enhances evasion of the innate immune system.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !h self assert = At this point we conjecture that the deletions we detected are neutral or to some extent deleterious, and that deletions in SARS-CoV-2 are likely to occur frequently given the number of deletions detected in our samples.

doi: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-29548/v1
ref 'Adam_et_al_2020
  head = Given a superspreading threshold of 6-8 secondary cases, we identified 5-7 probable superspreading events and evidence of substantial overdispersion in transmissibility, and estimated that 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of local transmission. Among terminal cluster cases, 27% (45/167) ended in quarantine. Social exposures produced a greater number of secondary cases compared to family or work exposures (p<0.001) while delays between symptom onset and isolation did not reliably predict the number of individual secondary cases or resulting cluster sizes.

  >>> Abstract
    Superspreading events have characterised previous epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections. Using contact tracing data, we identified and characterized SARS-CoV-2 clusters in Hong Kong. Given a superspreading threshold of 6-8 secondary cases, we identified 5-7 probable superspreading events and evidence of substantial overdispersion in transmissibility, and estimated that 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of local transmission. Among terminal cluster cases, 27% (45/167) ended in quarantine. Social exposures produced a greater number of secondary cases compared to family or work exposures (p<0.001) while delays between symptom onset and isolation did not reliably predict the number of individual secondary cases or resulting cluster sizes. Public health authorities should focus on rapid tracing and quarantine of contacts, along with physical distancing to prevent superspreading events in high-risk social environments.

  let !a self assert = Our results indicate 5-7 probable SSEs in Hong Kong, and substantial  individual heterogeneity in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1; k=0.45, 95%: 0.30 – 0.72) and therefore potential for future superspreading, albeit less than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (k=0.16 and 0.26 respectively).

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !b self assert = We estimated that approximately 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Hong Kong. These results however should be interpreted in the context of constrained community transmission given moderate levels of physical distancing currently practiced in Hong Kong, including school closures, some adults working at home, cancellation of mass gatherings, as well as improved hygiene and universal mask wearing.

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !c self assert = Superspreading is considered a function of both variations in individual transmissibility and individual susceptibility or exposure. Our results show that the number of individual secondary cases was significantly higher within social settings such as bars and restaurants compared to family or work exposures (p<0.001). This is certainly due to the greater numbers of contacts expected in such settings. Targeted interventions should therefore focus on reducing extreme numbers of social contacts at high-risk venues such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants, which also appear at increased risk of SSE, either via closures or physical distancing policies, both of which currently remain implemented in Hong Kong.

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !d self assert = Previous modelling has suggested that reduced delays between symptom onset and isolation are important indicators for the control of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks however this did not appear to play a major role in Hong Kong: in our analysis, delay from symptom onset to isolation were not associated with the number of individual secondary cases, nor the final cluster size. In contrast, for SARS-CoV various epidemics in 2003, due to delayed viral shedding among cases (highest approximately seven days after symptom onset), delays in case isolation adversely affected disease control efforts.

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !e self assert = Public health authorities should focus on rapid tracing and quarantine of contacts, along with physical distancing to prevent superspreading events in high-risk social environments.

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !f self assert = Given a coefficient of variation of 2.5 from our study this roughly corresponds to an adjusted herd immunity threshold of 20%, which is consistent with our estimate that 20% of individuals are responsible for 80% of transmission in Hong Kong. This compares to a herd-immunity threshold of 60-70% via vaccine-acquired immunity. The real-world effects of naturally acquired herd immunity however should be further studies and measured with serology along with the progressive easing of restrictions.

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !g self assert = For COVID-19, confirmation and isolation of symptomatic cases will have a limited effect on reducing overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community unless done very quickly, noting the growing body of evidence of substantial transmission during the pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic period.

  / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
  let !h self assert = In Hong Kong, the average delay to isolation was 5.6 days for cluster cases, and by this time most onwards transmission had perhaps already occurred. The most important public health measures therefore are likely to be case identification followed by rapid and parallel (e.g. before contacts are confirmed as cases) contact tracing and quarantine. Some degree of intermittent physical distancing may also be required to supress potential local transmission from unidentified infections and pre-symptomatic transmission, but must necessarily be balanced with the social, economic and educational costs associated with such policies.

 / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
 let !i self assert = Secondly, our results also suggest a potential caveat: despite evidence supporting rapid contact tracing and the effectiveness of quarantine, in our analysis, most chains of transmission did not terminate in quarantine. This however must be interpreted in the context of moderate physical distancing in Hong Kong as highlighted previously, rather than a suggestion that quarantine was not essential.

 / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
 let !j self assert = In the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing implemented in Hong Kong, the potential for SSEs is likely greater than observed in our study. Assuming local elimination is not possible, disease control efforts should focus on rapid tracing and quarantine of confirmed contacts, along with the implementation of physical distancing policies or closures targeting high292 risk social exposures such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants to prevent the occurrence of SSEs. Given the long right-hand tail of the distribution of individual reproductive numbers, preventing SSEs would have a considerable effect in reducing the overall reproductive number. In lieu of an effective vaccine, theseresults have significant implications for the control of COVID-19 and public health measures such as physical distancing and the relaxation of lockdowns around the world.

// Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain COVID-19 in China
doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2293-x
ref 'Lai_et_al_2020
  head = From a public health standpoint, our results highlight that countries should consider proactively planning NPIs and relevant resources for containment and mitigation, given how the earlier implementation of NPIs could have lead to significant reductions in size of the outbreak in China. The results here also provide guidance for countries as to the likely effectiveness of different NPIs at different stages of an outbreak. Suspected and confirmed cases should be identified, diagnosed, isolated and reported as early as possible to control the source of infection, and the implementation of cordon sanitaires or travel restrictions for significantly affected areas may prevent seeding the virus to wider regions. Reducing contact and increasing social distance, together with improved personal hygiene can protect vulnerable populations and mitigate COVID-19 spread at the community level, and these interventions should be promoted throughout the outbreak to avoid resurgence.

  >>> Abstract
    On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic1. The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings3. Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data4,5, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.

  let !a self assert =  Reconstruction of COVID-19 spread: The estimated epidemics and peaks were consistent with patterns of reported data by onset date, with high correlations between daily estimates and reported data found across time and regions. The overall correlation between the number of estimated cases and the reported number by province, as of February 29, 2020, was also significant (p<0.001, R2 =0.86), with a high sensitivity (91%, 280/308) and specificity (69%, 22/32) in predicting cities with or without COVID-19 cases.

  let !b self assert = Quantifying the effect of different NPIs: Without NPIs, as of February 29, the number of COVID-19 cases wouldincrease rapidly across China, with a 51-fold (IQR 33 - 71) increase in Wuhan, a 92-fold (58 - 133) increase in other cities in Hubei, and a 125-fold (77 - 180) increase in other provinces.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !c self assert =  However, the apparent effectiveness of different interventions varied. The lockdown of Wuhan might not have prevented the seeding of the virus from the city, as the travel ban was put in place at the latter stages of pre-CNY population movement out of the city. Nevertheless, if inter-city travel restrictions were not implemented, cities and provinces outside of Wuhan would have received more cases from Wuhan, and the affected geographic range would have expanded to the remote western areas of China.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !d self assert =  Generally, the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to quickly and substantially prevent more infections than contact reduction and social distancing across the country (5-fold versus 2.6-fold). However, without the intervention of contact reductions, in the longer term, the epidemics would increase exponentially across regions. Therefore, combinedNPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment, with about a one-week interval from NPIs to epidemic peak.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !e self assert = Intervention timings: If interventions in China could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, cases could have been dramatically reduced by 66% (IQR 50% - 82%), 86% (81% - 90%), or 95% (93% - 97%), respectively. The geographical range of affected areas would also shrink from 308 cities to 192, 130, and 61 cities, respectively. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later than they were, cases may have shown a 3-fold (IQR 2 - 4), 7-fold (5 - 10), or 18-fold (11 - 26) increase, respectively.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !f self assert = The lifting of travel restrictions: However, if population contact resumed to the normal levels seen in previous years, the lifting of travel restrictions since February 17 might cause case numbers to rise again  Accordingly, our simulations suggest that maintaining social distancing at even a limited degree (e.g. 25% contact reduction on average) through late April would help ensure control of COVID-19 in epicentres like Wuhan. Our estimates were sensitive to the basic reproduction number (R0), with a higher and later peak of epidemics and longer time needed to contain the outbreak under a higher R0. Sensitivity analyses also suggested that our model could have robustly measured relative changes in the efficacy of interventions under different epidemiological parameters and transmission senarios.

  let !g self assert = Our findings show that combined NPIs substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China. Earlier implementation of NPIs could have significantly reduced the magnitude and geographical range of the outbreak, but equally, a delayed response would have lead to a larger outbreak. Chinas aggressive, multifaceted response is likely to have prevented a far worse situation, which would have accelerated spread globally. The lessons drawn from China provide robust evidence andprovide a preparation window and fighting chance for containing the spread and mi

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !h self assert = Our results suggest three key points. First, they support and validate the idea that population movement and close contact has a major role in the spread of COVID-19 within and beyond China. As the lockdown of Wuhan happened at the latter stages of the pre-CNY movement, travel restrictions did not halt the seeding of the virus from Wuhan, but did prevent cases being exported from Wuhan to a wider area.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !i self assert = Secondly, the importance and effects of the three types of NPIs differed. Compared to travel restrictions, improved detection and isolation of cases as well as the social distancing likely had a greater impact on the containment of outbreak. The social distancing intervention reduced contact with people who travelled from the epicentre of the outbreak. This is likely to have been especially helpful in curbing the spread of an emerging pathogen to the wider community, and reduced the spread risk from asymptomatic or mild infections.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !j self assert = Third, given travel and work resuming in China, the country should consider at least the partial continuation of NPIs to ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak is sustainably controlled for the first wave of this outbreak. For example, early case identification and isolation should be maintained, which may also help to prevent and delay the arrival of a second wave, considering the increasing numbers of cases imported from other countries and the presence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections found in China.

  / May, 2020 - Nature
  let !k self assert = The analyses presented here represent the most comprehensive study yet in which the effect of NPIs on COVID-19 transmission has been quantitatively assessed. The model framework accounts for daily interactions of populations, interventions between and within cities, as well as the inherent statistical uncertainty associated with a paucity of epidemiological parameters, before and after the implementation of interventions. The network-based SEIR model is methodologically robust and built on the basic SEIR models previously used to predict COVID-19 transmission in its early stages. Considering delays in case reporting, our approach can be used for rapid, ongoing estimation of the effectiveness of various NPIs in different countries for outbreakcontrol decision-making.

// Convalescent plasma treatment of severe COVID-19: A matched control study
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20102236
ref 'Liu_et_al_2020
  head =    This initial assessment offers evidence in support of convalescent plasma transfusion as an effective intervention in COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation. Preliminary data suggest a potential mortality benefit, but greater numbers are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Interestingly, these data suggest that the survival effect of convalescent plasma may begin to manifest more than 1 week after transfusion. If this observation is borne out in subsequent studies, it could indicate that convalescent plasma prevents longer-term complications, such as acute lung injury or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; however, this speculation awaits confirmation in a larger patient cohort.

  >>> Background
    Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing mass morbidity and mortality. Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls.

  >>> Methods
    Plasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti43 spike antibody titer of ³1:320 dilution. Matched control patients were retrospectively identified within the electronic health record database. Supplemental oxygen requirements and survival were compared between plasma recipients and controls.

  >>> Results
    Convalescent plasma recipients were more likely than control patients to remain the same or have improvements in their supplemental oxygen requirements by post-transfusion day 14, with an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). Plasma recipients also demonstrated improved survival, compared to control patients(log-rank test: p=0.039). In a covariates-adjusted Cox model, convalescent plasma transfusion improved survival for non-intubated patients (hazard ratio 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05 ~0.72); p=0.015), but not for intubated patients (1.24 (0.33~4.67); p=0.752).

  >>> Conclusions
    Convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.

By day 14, clinical condition had worsened in 18.0% of the plasma patients and 24.3% in the control patients (p=0.167, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). The covariates-adjusted odds ratio for worsening oxygenation on day 14 was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). The effect of plasma appeared to be confounded by the use of therapeutic anticoagulants (unadjusted vs. adjusted OR: 0.90 vs. 0.84), but not on other types of drugs or duration of symptoms before admission (OR remained in the range of 0.90~0.91). On days 1 and 7, the plasma group also showed a reduction in the proportion of patients with worsened oxygenation status, but the group difference did not reach statistical significance.

The median follow-up time was 11 [1, 28] days for the plasma group and 9 [0, 31] days for the control group. Overall, we observed improved survival for the plasma group (log187 rank test: p=0.039).

  let !e self assert = Other than intubated versus non-intubated patients, the small size of this cohort lacks sufficient power to permit additional subgroup analyses. We did not observe significant benefit of convalescent plasma in intubated patients, consistent with past literature demonstrating that passive antibody transfer therapies are most efficacious early in disease. However, the number of intubated patients in this study is small, limiting our ability to reach any conclusions about this population. Future studies that include more mechanically ventilated patients will be needed to address this uncertainty.

  let !h self assert = There is a risk of fluid volume overload, particularly in patients with end-stage renal disease or advanced heart failure. Allergic reactions to plasma are typically mild and self-limited. Plasma naturally contains procoagulants, whose additive effects are unknown in this disease, which is independently associated with hypercoagulability; thus, pending more data, additional caution should be exercised in patients with acute thrombotic events.

  let !i self assert = Convalescent plasma transfusions also have theoretical risks, such as hindering the maturation of the patient’s own adaptive immune memory response and antibody-dependent enhancement. While keeping these risks in mind, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and draw more definitive conclusions about the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion for the treatment of COVID244 19 in different populations

// SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary municipal sewage sludge as a leading indicator of COVID-19 outbreak dynamics
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20105999
ref 'Peccia_et_al_2020
  head = The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge were tracked throughout a COVID-19 epidemic and compared with traditional outbreak epidemiological indicators. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in primary sludge closely followed the epidemiology curves established by compiled COVID-19 testing data and hospital admissions, but was a leading indicator by seven and three days, respectively.

  >>> Abstract
    We report a time course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge during the Spring COVID-19 outbreak in a northeastern U.S. metropolitan area. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all environmental samples and, when adjusted for the time lag, the virus RNA concentrations were highly correlated with the COVID-19 epidemiological curve (R2=0.99) and local hospital admissions (R2=0.99). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were a seven-day leading indicator ahead of compiled COVID-19 testing data and led local hospital admissions data by three days. Decisions to implement or relax public health measures and restrictions require timely information on outbreak dynamics in a community.

  let !a self assert = SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations were quantitatively compared with local hospital admission data and community COVID-19 compiled testing data. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detectable in all samples tested and ranged from 1.7 x 103 virus RNA copies mL-1 to 4.6 x 105 virus RNA copies mL-1. The lower concentration in this range corresponds to a qRT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) value of 38.75 and can be considered a detection threshold for this method and sludge matrix.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !b self assert = Overall, 96.5% of all CT values were less than 38 and values between 38 and 40 were reported as positive if detection occurred with virus nucleocapsid N1 and N2 primer sets and both replicates.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !c self assert = Concentration comparisons  between replicates produced an average slope of 0.98 ± 0.17 st. dev., while replicates comparing N and RP primer values result in a flat line, with average slope of 0.05 ± 0.05 st. dev. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration time series results consistently reveal a curve that increases over times, peaks, and then decreases to May 1.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !d self assert = New Haven COVID-19 epidemic suggest that these data may provide useful epidemiological insights (Figure 1C). SARS-CoV-2 RNA sludge concentrations were quantitatively compared with data that are commonly used to track the community progression of COVID-19 including hospital admissions and COVID-19 compiled testing data for the four municipalities (New Haven, East Haven, Hamden, and Woodbridge, CT) served by the ESWPAF. All three measures traced the initial wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the New Haven metropolitan area.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !e self assert = The virus RNA time course peaked 3 days earlier than hospital admissions (April 9 versus April 12) and a cross correlation analysis revealed a correlation coefficient (R=0.996) between smoothed RNA and hospital data when the latter was shifted 3 days forward.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !f self assert = Comparing the LOWESS-smoothed daily virus RNA and COVID-19 testing data reveals that the peak in COVID-19 cases (April 16) occurred 7 days following the peak in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (April 9). A cross correlation analysis resulted in a maximum correlation coefficient (R=0.994) when the COVID-19 testing data is adjusted 7 days forward. Regressing the adjusted COVID-19 testing data and SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA concentrations yield a value of 1,305 virus RNA copies/mL per new COVID-19 case report as the outbreak ascended, and 1,240 virus RNA copies/mL per new COVID-19 case report as the outbreak descended.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !g self assert = This study uniquely utilized primary sewage sludge instead of raw wastewater for virus RNA measurements. Sewage sludge is comprised of solids that are removed during primary sedimentation steps and typically gravity thickened. As a result, primary sludge has a greater solids content (2 to 5%) than raw wastewater (0.01 to 0.05%).

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !h self assert = Due to the elevated solids content and the high case load observed during the outbreak (~1,200 per 100,000 population), the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA reported here ranged from two to three orders of magnitude greater than raw wastewater SARS-CoV-2 values previously reported

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !i self assert = SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in sewage sludge were a leading indicator of community outbreak dynamics over hospitalization and compiled COVID-19 testing data. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations led hospital admissions by 3 days and COVID-19 cases by 7 days.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !j self assert = SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations led hospital admissions by 3 days and COVID-19 cases by 7 days.  Hospital admissions to Yale New Haven Hospital from the four towns served by the wastewater treatment facility both rose and fell more slowly than the observed RNA concentrations. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increases and decreases were similar to the COVID-19 testing data, and reflect the very concentrated outbreak that took place within New Haven and its neighboring towns. The strong correlation between the virus RNA and COVID-19 case data provides an approach to independently evaluate the local SARS-CoV-2 testing rate and to estimate the number of new cases.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !k self assert = While the results here demonstrate the potential utility of such an approach, we note that these relationships could be treatment plant specific, as primary sludge process trains are not uniform, and that compiled COVID-19 testing is prompted by symptoms, thus underestimating the true number of cases

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !l self assert = Our study could have substantial policy implications. Jurisdictions can use primary sludge SARS-CoV-2 concentrations to preempt community outbreak dynamics or provide an additional basis for easing restrictions, especially when there are limitations in clinical testing. Raw wastewater and sludge-based surveillance is particularly useful for low and middle-income countries where clinical testing capacity is limited.



# Remdesivir
// Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report
doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764
ref 'Beigel_et_al_2020
  head = Preliminary results of this trial suggest that a 10-day course of remdesivir was superior to placebo in the treatment of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

  >>> Background
    Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), none have yet been shown to be efficacious.

  >>> Methods
    We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.

  >>> Results
    A total of 1063 patients underwent randomization. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group. Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04). Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).

  >>> Conclusions
    Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

  let !b self assert =  Mortality was numerically lower in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group, but the difference was not significant (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04; 1059 patients). The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% and 11.9% in the remdesivir and placebo groups, respectively. The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days are not reported in this preliminary analysis, given the large number of patients that had yet to complete day 29 visits. An analysis with adjustment for baseline ordinal score as a stratification variable showed a hazard ratio for death of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 to 1.10).

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !c self assert = Serious adverse events occurred in 114 patients (21.1%) in the remdesivir group and 141 patients (27.0%) in the placebo group; 4 events (2 in each group) were judged by site investigators to be related to remdesivir or placebo. There were 28 serious respiratory failure adverse events in the remdesivir group (5.2% of patients) and 42 in the placebo group (8.0% of patients). Acute respiratory failure, hypotension, viral pneumonia, and acute kidney injury were slightly more common among patients in the placebo group. No deaths were considered to be related to treatment assignment, as judged by the site investigators.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !d self assert = Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 156 patients (28.8%) in the remdesivir group and in 172 in the placebo group (33.0%). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were anemia or decreased hemoglobin (43 events [7.9%], as compared with 47 [9.0%] in the placebo group); acute kidney injury, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, or increased blood creatinine (40 events [7.4%], as compared with 38 [7.3%]); pyrexia (27 events [5.0%], as compared with 17 [3.3%]); hyperglycemia or increased blood glucose level (22 events [4.1%], as compared with 17 [3.3%]); and increased aminotransferase levels including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or both (22 events [4.1%], as compared with 31 [5.9%]). Otherwise, the incidence of adverse events was not found to be significantly different between the remdesivir group and the placebo group.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !e self assert =  Among patients with a baseline ordinal score of 5 (421 patients), the rate ratio for recovery was 1.47 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.84); among patients with a baseline score of 4 (127 patients) and those with a baseline score of 6 (197 patients), the rate ratio estimates for recovery were 1.38 (95% CI, 0.94 to 2.03) and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.81), respectively. For those receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO at enrollment (baseline ordinal scores of 7; 272 patients), the rate ratio for recovery was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.42). A test of interaction of treatment with baseline score on the ordinal scale was not significant.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !f self assert = The odds of improvement in the ordinal scale score were higher in the remdesivir group, as determined by a proportional odds model at the day 15 visit, than in the placebo group (odds ratio for improvement, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.91; P=0.001; 844 patients)

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !g self assert = Our findings highlight the need to identify Covid-19 cases and start antiviral treatment before the pulmonary disease progresses to require mechanical ventilation.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !h self assert = These preliminary findings support the use of remdesivir for patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19 and require supplemental oxygen therapy. However, given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is clear that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient. Future strategies should evaluate antiviral agents in combination with other therapeutic approaches or combinations of antiviral agents to continue to improve patient outcomes in Covid-19.

// A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9
ref 'WooChan_et_al_2020
  head = Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions

  >>> Background
    An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.

  >>> Methods
    In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.

  >>> Findings
    From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.

  >>> Interpretation
    Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !e self assert = Older patients (aged >60 years) with comorbidities had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The multifocal ground-glass changes on lung CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia. Their lung involvement was also more diffuse and extensive than those of the younger patients, whose blood test results were largely normal.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !f self assert = The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !g self assert =  These findings suggested that person-to-person transmission and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV by air travel are possible, supporting reports of infected Chinese travellers from Wuhan being detected in other geographical regions.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !h self assert = Many of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of this novel coronavirus pneumonia were similar to those of SARS patients in 2003. The incubation period of the Wuhan pneumonia appeared similar to that of SARS. The attack rate is rather high, up to 83% if we included the five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) with unexplained ground-glass radiological changes of the lungs on CT scan as the case definition in this family outbreak after visiting Wuhan.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !i self assert = A rather unexpected finding from the lung CT scan of patient 5, which was done on the insistence by the nervous parents, also showed ground-glass pneumonic changes. Patient 5 was later confirmed virologically to have an asymptomatic infection. Notably, patients 3 and 4 were afebrile at presentation to our hospital. These cryptic cases of walking pneumonia might serve as a possible source to propagate the outbreak. Further studies on the epidemiological significance of these asymptomatic cases are warranted.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !j self assert = Patient 4, who had a history of chronic sinusitis, might have a bacterial superinfection because he had a productive cough instead of a dry cough. He also had a high white blood cell count, although the bacterial test was negative.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !k self assert = Interestingly, the two younger adults (patients 3 and 4) initially had diarrhoea, which was also reported in 10·6% (15 of 142) of our SARS patients at presentation;18 however, the subsequent faecal samples of patients 3 and 4 that were collected 9–10 days after symptom onset were negative for the virus after the diarrhoea had long subsided.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !l self assert = On microbiological testing, we did not find any evidence of other known respiratory viral or bacterial infections, but specific RT-PCR assays for two widely separated genome targets—the highly conserved RdRp and the highly variable S genes—were positive for this novel 2019-nCoV. Two complete genome sequences of this novel coronavirus were recovered from the nasopharyngeal swab of patient 2 and the sputum sample of patient 5 with an earlier cycle threshold value indicating a higher viral load.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !m self assert = Patient 2 had more underlying comorbidities and clinical features and radiological findings of more severe disease than the other patients included here. Moreover, the serum sample of patient 2 was also positive for 2019-nCoV, which might indicate some virus spillover from the more severely infected lung into the systemic circulation, as previously reported in patients with SARS

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !n self assert = Sputum samples were available for testing from patients 5 and 7. The cycle threshold values of the sputum samples were 8–13 cycles earlier than those of throat swabs, indicating higher viral loads detected in the lower respiratory tract. This finding is consistent with the observations in patients with MERS who had higher viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples than in upper respiratory tract samples.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !o self assert = Unlike our patients in the 2003 SARS outbreak,22 we found no evidence of viral shedding in urine and faeces in these six patients. However, improved systematic serial collection and testing of an increased number of such samples is warranted.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !p self assert = Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR amplicon fragments from five of our six patients and the complete virus genome of 29·8 kilobases from patients 2 and 5 showed that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B or subgenus sarbecovirus, which also includes the human SARS coronavirus. The genome of our virus strains are phylogenetically closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses first found in the Chinese horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus, captured in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !q self assert = The full virus genome had about an 89% nucleotide identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45, which makes it a new species. Moreover, the Spike protein of our virus has an 84% nucleotide identity with the bat-SL-CoVZC45 coronavirus and an 78% nucleotide identity with the human SARS coronavirus. Although substantial genetic differences exist between this and other betacoronaviruses, cross reactions in RT-PCR or antibody assays for SARS or other betacoronaviruses are possible if the primers and antigenic epitopes are not carefully chosen, as previously reported.30 Further studies on the optimal diagnostic tests are warranted.

  / January, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !r self assert = As shown in this study, it is still crucial to isolate patients and trace and quarantine contacts as early as possible because asymptomatic infection appears possible (as shown in one of our patients), educate the public on both food and personal hygiene, and alert health-care workers on compliance to infection control to prevent super-spreading events. Unlike the 2003 SARS outbreak, the improved surveillance network and laboratory capability of China was able to recognise this outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome sequences that would allow the development of rapid diagnostic tests and efficient epidemiological control.

  head = It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

  >>> Objective
    To identify common features of cases with novel coronavirus disease24 (COVID-19) so as to better understand what factors promote secondary transmission including superspreading events.

  >>> Methods
    A total of 110 cases were examined among eleven clusters and sporadic cases, and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data.

  >>> Results
    Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

  >>> Conclusions
    It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

  head = All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

  >>> Background
    By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted.

  >>> Methods
    Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues.

  >>> Results
    Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

  >>> Conclusions
    All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.

  let !a self assert = We identified 318 outbreaks involving 1,245 infected individuals in 120 cities. The top three cities were Shenzhen, Guangdong (24 outbreaks, 7·5%; 84 cases, 6·7%), Chongqing (16 outbreaks, 5·0%; 61 cases, 4·9%) and Bozhou, Anhui (nine outbreaks, 2·8%; 35, 2·8%).

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !b self assert = The average number (SD) of cases per outbreak was 3·921·65. Among the 318 identified outbreaks, more than half (171; 53·8%) involved three cases, more than a quarter (84; 26·4%) involved four cases, and only five (1·6%) outbreaks involved ten or more cases.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !c self assert = Among the 318 outbreaks, 129 involved only family members, 133 involved family relatives, 29 involved socially connected individuals, 24 involved socially non-connected, and only three involved multiple relationships. In addition to family members, family relatives and socially connected individuals constituted a large proportion of the infected cases.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !d self assert =  Among the 318 outbreaks, 254 (79·9%) occurred in a home (one in a villa; all others in apartments), 108 (34·0%) in transport, 14 at a restaurant or other food venue, seven at an entertainment venue, and seven at a shopping venue (shopping mall and supermarket), with an additional 26 at a miscellaneous venue (e.g.hospital, hotel room, unspecified community, and thermal power plant).

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !e self assert = Most of the 254 home outbreaks included three to five cases (145 with three cases, 66 with four cases, and 25 with five cases). The average number of cases was 3·7 for the home outbreaks, 3·8 for transport, 4·9 for food venues, 3·6 for entertainment venues, 8·7 for shopping venues, and 4·4 for miscellaneous venues. The proportion of large outbreaks was high for shops and food venues, possibly because more susceptible individuals were present in these venues than in homes. Shopping and entertainment venues were each associated with only seven outbreaks. This seems to suggest the difficulty of implementing preventive measures in places with large numbers of susceptible individuals.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !f self assert = Between 29 December 2019 and 31 January 2020, we also identified 231 outbreaks with known start and end dates of the suspected infectious period (Figure 2A). The identified outbreaks peaked between 23 and 28 January (Figure 2A), which coincides with the celebration period of the Chinese New Year (CNY). CNY 2020 lasted from New Year’s Eve on 24 January to the Lantern Festival (i.e., the 15th of Lunar January) on 8 February. The official holiday in mainland China was from 24 to 30 January 2020. The peak date for the number of transport outbreaks was 1 to 2 days earlier than that for the home outbreaks as people travelled home for CNY.

  let !g self assert = We further divided those 126 outbreaks into two subgroups according to the index patient’s symptom-onset date: on or before 28 January (96 outbreaks) and after 28 January (30 outbreaks). The average time from symptom onset to the ending infectious date was 3·76±4·42 days for those on and before 28 January and 0·87±2·80 days for those afterward.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !h self assert = Our study does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus. However, among our 7,324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred in a village in Shangqiu, Henan. A 27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with an individual who had returned from Wuhan on 25 January and had the onset of symptoms on 1 February.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !i self assert = The second salient feature of the 318 identified outbreaks is the relatively small number of outbreaks that involved 10 or more cases. The largest outbreak occurred in a Tianjin shopping mall and involved 21 cases, although Wu et al. reported that 25 cases were involved.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !j self assert = The occurrence of many small outbreaks (in number of cases) in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a different transmission pattern from that of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Some virus, epidemiological, and environmental factors could have contributed to this observed difference between the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !k self assert = We do not have data on the hygiene conditions and human density of the infection venues of the 318 outbreaks studied here. The exact location of the infection venues and the necessary parameters such as the floor area or the number of occupants were not provided in the case reports. Instead, we reviewed the current design standards of thermal and ventilation conditions, occupant density and close contact behaviour in the various indoor environments discussed here.  The required ventilation rates vary significantly among homes, offices, trains, and buses. For example, the required ventilation rate is only 3·9 L/s per person in shopping malls and 2·8 L/s per person in public buses, whereas a ventilation rate of 8 to 10 L/s is required for good indoor air quality.26 An international systematic review showed that a rate as high as 25 L/s per person may be needed.

  / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !l self assert = This study shows that the individual indoor environments in which we live and work are the most common venues in which the virus of the once-in-a-century-pandemic is transmitted among us. An individual infected in one building may infect others in the building(s) that he or she later visits. People are in constant contact as they move from one indoor space or building to another, which creates an indoor contact network through which a virus can spread.17 The buildings and transport cabins in various parts of the world are thus connected and facilitated the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic virus.

doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6919e6
ref 'Hamner_et_al_2020
  head = This outbreak of COVID-19 with a high secondary attack rate indicates that SARS-CoV-2 might be highly transmissible in certain settings, including group singing events. This underscores the importance of physical distancing, including maintaining at least 6 feet between persons, avoiding group gatherings and crowded places, and wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain during this pandemic. If this is not feasible, washing hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when ill, and frequently cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces remain critical to reducing transmission The choir mitigated further spread by quickly communicating to its members and notifying SCPH of a cluster of cases on March 18. When first contacted by SCPH during March 18–20, nearly all persons who attended the practice reported they were already self-isolating or quarantining.

The median incubation period of COVID-19 is estimated to be 5.1 days. The median interval from exposure during the March 10 practice to onset of illness was 3 days, indicating a more rapid onset. Attendees developed symptoms 1 to 12 days after the practice (median = 3 days). The first SARS-CoV-2 test was performed on March 13. The last person was tested on March 26.

// Excess mortality from Covid-19. Weekly excess death rates by age and sex for Sweden.
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096909
ref 'Modig_et_al_2020
  head = From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. The pattern shows that persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and that men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women. Currently this excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 and 2 years for men and women respectively. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on life expectancy will be determined by a complex interplay of several factors. Until now, the Covid-19 pandemic however has already caused a health burden that reached historic extents on the total mortality of the Swedish population.

  >>> Objectives
    Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden.

  >>> Design
    We make use of Swedish register data about total weekly deaths, total population at risk, and estimate age- and sex-specific weekly death rates for 2020 and the 5 previous years. The data is provided by Statistics Sweden.

  >>> Results
    From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women.

  >>> Conclusion
    The Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a clear and consistent effect on total mortality in Sweden, with male death rates being comparably more affected. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on mortality and life expectancy will depend on the progression of the pandemic, the extent that some of the deaths would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic, only somewhat later, the consequences for other health conditions, as well as the health care sector at large.

  let !c self assert = To get an idea of the overall magnitude of excess deaths on total mortality, we estimated life expectancy per week and showed that the excess mortality in 2020 corresponds to a decline in life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women during week 13 to week 16. This is in line with a recently published working paper by Goldstein and Lee, who estimated, among other things, the reduction in remaining life expectancy to 3 years for the US, and a recent preprint paper from Italy estimating the life expectancy impact for northern Italy at a similar range.

The death toll we found is in line with this finding and suggest at least the number of deaths in near future must reach unrealistically low levels to off-set the tragic losses observed until recently.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !g self assert = Our results also confirm the sex difference in mortality that are based on death counts and reported since the outbreak of Covid-19. Although subject to fluctuations, the rate ratios of the age-specific death rates show approximately similar general age patterns for men and women. However, the magnitude of excess mortality is higher for men at all ages.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !h self assert = We cannot draw any conclusions about whether the mortality difference truly stem from different chances of surviving Covid-19, or a difference in the risk of getting affected, neither can we explain the mechanisms to the observed sex differences Even if the number of confirmed cases is similar for men and women in Sweden, and in other countries, it is still confirmed cases and not all cases. However, based on the confirmed cases it clearly seems as if men have higher fatality. This together with our finding that excess mortality follows the same age-pattern for men and women but with higher levels for men at all ages may suggest biological explanations.

  >>> Abstact
    The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.

Impaired ISG expression and tissue repair and increased viral burden and mortality after influenza virus infection have been proven in mice exposed to 7 days of low RH of10–20%. Devastating disease course following dry air exposure is mediated by inflammasome caspase activation.

  >>> Abstract
    The host response to viral infection includes the induction of type I interferons and the subsequent upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is an interferon-induced protein that has been implicated as a central player in the host antiviral response. Over the past 15 years, efforts to understand how ISG15 protects the host during infection have revealed that its actions are diverse and pathogen-dependent. In this Review, we describe new insights into how ISG15 directly inhibits viral replication and discuss the recent finding that ISG15 modulates the host damage and repair response, immune response and other host signalling pathways. We also explore the viral immune-evasion strategies that counteract the actions of ISG15. These findings are integrated with a discussion of the recent identification of ISG15-deficient individuals and a cellular receptor for ISG15 that provides new insights into how ISG15 shapes the host response to viral infection.

Recent studies have advanced our understanding by elucidating how ISG15 antagonizes viral replication during acute and latent infections; identifying immune-evasion strategies; beginning to characterize how ISG15 alters disease pathogenesis, including its ability to limit tissue damage and to modulate human type I interferon signalling; and identifying the first cell surface receptor for unconjugated ISG15, which can regulate cytokine release.

  let !c self assert = The ISG15 conjugation system has been intimately tied to protein translation, but it also results in the targeted modification of proteins, as outlined above. How the modification of a small fraction of the total pool of a protein can affect its overall function within a cell is still unclear. Possibilities include the ability of ISGylated proteins to disrupt oligomerization of proteins or to alter the cellular localization of proteins. Another intriguing possibility is that ISGylation could serve as a warning sign to the cell that it is infected.

The application of novel proteome analyses will be crucial for determining the conjugation preference, scope and potential biological outcomes of protein ISGylation. Although initial proteomic studies to identify ISGylated proteins have been performed in interferon-stimulated cells, this analysis will need to be expanded to different cell types and viruses.

However, tools that differentiate between the functions of unconjugated extracellular and intracellular ISG15 are lacking. The recent identification of LFA1 as an ISG15 receptor may facilitate the biological characterization of extracellular ISG15.

  let !f self assert = In vivo studies have provided evidence that it functions during viral pathogenesis to limit tissue damage, independent of its ability to directly antagonize viral replication. The ability of ISG15 to non-covalently bind to USP18 and to regulate type I interferon signalling in humans indicates that ISG15 may interact with other unidentified intracellular proteins, independent of conjugation, to regulate additional cellular processes. Uncovering the binding partners will be instrumental in understanding its molecular mechanism of action.

  let !g self assert = In recent years, ISG15 has been used as a marker of antiviral treatment and as an immune adjuvant to enhance T cell antitumour immunity. Further characterization of the ISGylation pathway could help to identify druggable targets, offering new opportunities to intervene in the progression of many diseases.

  >>> Abstract
    The disinfection industry would greatly benefit from efficient, robust, high-power deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV–C LEDs). However, the performance of UV–C AlGaN LEDs is limited by poor light-extraction efficiency (LEE) and the presence of a large density of threading dislocations. We demonstrate high power AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC with high LEE and low threading dislocation density. We employ a crack-free AlN buffer layer with low threading dislocation density and a technique to fabricate thin-film UV LEDs by removing the SiC substrate, with a highly selective SF6 etch. The LEDs (278 nm) have a turn-on voltage of 4.3 V and a CW power of 8 mW (82 mW/mm2) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8% at 95 mA. KOH submicron roughening of the AlN surface (nitrogen-polar) and improved p-contact reflectivity are found to be effective in improving the LEE of UV light. We estimate the improved LEE by semiempirical calculations to be 33% (without encapsulation). This work establishes UV LEDs grown on SiC substrates as a viable architecture to large-area, high-brightness, and high-power UV LEDs.

// Effectiveness of precautions against droplets and contact in prevention of nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13168-6
ref 'Seto_et_al_2003
  head = Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS. The protective role of the mask suggests that in hospitals, infection is transmitted by droplets. This finding fits well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level making the mask crucial for protection.

  let !a self assert = Staff who used masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them, but the association for gloves was not significant. 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all 13 infected staff had omitted at least one of the measures (p=0·0224).

  / May, 2003 - The Lancet
  let !b self assert = Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0·0001), gowns (p=0·006), and washed their hands (p=0·047) became infected compared with those who didnt, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0·011).

  / May, 2003 - The Lancet
  let !c self assert = The staff who wore surgical masks and N95 masks were significantly associated with non-infection, but this was not seen for paper masks. The finding that paper masks did not significantly reduce the risk is not unexpected. Such masks, being easily wet with saliva, are never recommended as a precaution against droplets

  / May, 2003 - The Lancet
  let !d self assert = That use of masks and hand-washing was associated with non-infection, and that no staff became infected when they used all four measures, suggest that precautions against droplets and contact are adequate for prevention of nosocomial SARS, where no aerosolisations are expected.

  / May, 2003 - The Lancet
  let !e self assert = The surgical and N95 masks were both effective in significantly reducing the risk of infection, which together with the finding that 30% of non-infected staff did not use masks supports that transmission is not airborne.
