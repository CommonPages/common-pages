  head = In conclusion, culturing at the A/L renders primary human alveolar type II cells susceptible to productive SARS-CoV infection, and the cells mount a robust innate immune response, similar to that observed in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS. type II alveolar epithelial cells cultured at an A/L offer an excellent in vitro system in which to isolate and propagate emerging respiratory viruses that present with fastidious requirements for growth in highly differentiated human lung cells. These cultures also provide excellent in vitro models in which to evaluate the effects of candidate therapeutics that target the innate immune responses to respiratory virus infection.

  >>> Abstract
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–coronavirus (CoV) produces a devastating primary viral pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and a marked increase in circulating cytokines. One of the major cell types to be infected is the alveolar type II cell. However, the innate immune response of primary human alveolar epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV has not been defined. Our objectives included developing a culture system permissive for SARS-CoV infection in primary human type II cells and defining their innate immune response. Culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an air–liquid interface (A/L) improved their differentiation and greatly increased their susceptibility to infection, allowing us to define their primary interferon and chemokine responses. Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of infected type II cells, electron micrographs demonstrated secretory vesicles filled with virions, virus RNA concentrations increased with time, and infectious virions were released by exocytosis from the apical surface of polarized type II cells. A marked increase was evident in the mRNA concentrations of interferon–β and interferon–λ (IL-29) and in a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A surprising finding involved the variability of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme–2, the SARS-CoV receptor, in type II cells from different donors. In conclusion, the cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air–liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.

  let !a self assert = n the lung, very little fluid is present on the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium. Hence, the A/L conditions approximate conditions in vivo. A/L culture conditions improved the differentiation state of type II alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, and greatly enhanced their susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !b self assert = When the alveolar epithelium becomes infected, infected cells alert other cells and organs to the infection by secreting cytokines and chemokines. The infected epithelial cells are likely the first responders, and initiate the innate immune response. The earliest response of human alveolar type II cells to influenza virus infection involves the expression of interferon and interferon-responsive genes. Presumably this interferon response increases the resistance of neighboring cells to infection.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !c self assert = The next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of cytokines, which can both attract and activate immune cells and stimulate neighboring cells to amplify the defensive response greatly by secreting additional cytokines and chemokines. The innate response also signals the bone marrow to release additional inflammatory cells and initiates the adaptive immune response to recruit antigen-specific lymphocytes.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !d self assert = we measured the mRNAs encoding interferon-β and interferon-λ, and both were markedly elevated in response to SARS-CoV infection. Both of these interferons have been reported to be elevated in experimental SARS-CoV infections in primates and in cell lines infected with SARS-CoV. IL-29 is important in the innate immune response and may help control SARS-CoV infection

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !e self assert = Our data show that type II alveolar cells likely contribute to the high concentrations of cytokines and chemokines detected in the gas-exchange portion of the lungs in patients with SARS. In the sera of patients with SARS, the cytokine that increases most rapidly is CXCL10 (IP-10). Similarly, in our type II cells at the A/L, the level of CXCL10 mRNA expression increased more than 1,000 fold by 24 hours after virus inoculation

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !f self assert = The other cytokine that appears to predict the clinical course and outcome of SARS is IL-6. The concentration of mRNA encoding IL-6 was elevated approximately 10-fold in our SARS-CoV–infected alveolar type II cultures at the A/L.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !g self assert = In these particular experiments, we did not evaluate ultraviolet light–inactivated virus, but we knew from previous studies that type II cells do not present a cytokine or interferon response to ultraviolet light–inactivated influenza.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !h self assert = We found that rat alveolar type I–like cells infected with rat coronavirus stimulated noninfected cells in the culture to secrete cytokines and chemokines through an IL-1–dependent mechanism. Paracrine signaling by IL-1, which is released from infected type II cells during the activation of the inflammasome, may also play important roles, both in protecting type II cells from infection and in amplifying the innate immune response.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !i self assert = We observed that type II cells from donors who expressed higher concentrations of ACE2 and from culture conditions that increased ACE2 expression generally correlated with a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. However, we did not measure ACE2 concentrations in cells from enough different donors who were also inoculated with SARS-CoV, and we did not measure the extent of virus infection to prove this quantitatively. Although immunoblotting showed a modest but variable increase in ACE2 expression by type II cells when cultured at the A/L compared with submerged conditons, we did not detect a consistent increase in the surface expression of ACE2 by either flow cytometry or surface biotinylation.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !j self assert = Similarly, when we transdifferentiated type II cells at the A/L into type I–like cells that expressed very low levels of ACE2, we observed very little SARS-CoV infection. However, in type I–like cells transdifferentiated from a type II cell donor selected to express high concentrations of ACE2, we did observe the infection of type I–like cells. Because we did not demonstrate a clear increase in the surface expression of ACE2 under A/L conditions, we cannot conclude that the enhanced role of infection of type II cells at the A/L was attributable solely to the concentration of ACE2.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !k self assert = De Lang and colleagues reported that IL-4 and IL-13 decreased ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells. However, we found that IL-4/IL-13 actually increased ACE2 expression in our primary human alveolar type II cells. Hence, we added IL-4/IL-13 to increase ACE2 expression and thereby increase SARS-CoV infection.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !l self assert = We previously reported on the effects of IL-13 on human type II cells, and noted that IL-13 decreases SP-C and SP-D but exerts little effect on SP-A or SP-B. The slight decrease in SP-D could enhance the SARS infection, although this is unlikely, based on our experiments with 229E-6V (another coronavirus), in which SP-D did not make a major difference in the 229E-6V infectability of human alveolar macrophages. Nevertheless, SP-D has been reported to interact with the SARS spike glycoprotein, the attachment protein.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !m self assert = Alternatively, A/L culture conditions may have increased the level of expression in some other coreceptor for SARS-CoV, such as CD209L. In pilot experiments, we did not find a consistent increase in CD209L according to flow cytometry under A/L conditions.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !n self assert = Another consideration involves the details of the inoculation and the volume of apical fluid. In the A/L cultures, the inoculum was aspirated and cells were not washed, so some of the inoculum persisted in the surface fluid for the duration of the experiment. Perhaps the A/L conditions facilitated multiple cycles of virus infection. For example, after the first cycle of virus replication, the newly synthesized virus would be released into the scant amount of fluid on the apical surface, and this concentrated virus might accelerate secondary rounds of infection. In pilot studies, we observed that an increased susceptibility of type II cells to SARS-CoV infection required A/L culture conditions both before and after virus inoculation.

  / November, 2012 - Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol
  let !o self assert = Our cells were different and did not express Oct-4 or the club cell secretory protein, but they expressed surfactant proteins and cytokeratin, and contained characteristic lamellar bodies.

  head = Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19.

  >>> Summary
    Viral pandemics, such as the one caused by SARS-CoV-2, pose an imminent threat to humanity. Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we offer an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19.

  let !a self assert = In general, our data show that the overall transcriptional footprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection was distinct in comparison with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses and common respiratory viruses such as IAV, HPIV3, and RSV.

  / May, 2020 - Cell
  let !b self assert = It is noteworthy that, despite a reduced IFN-I and -III response to SARS-CoV-2, we observed a consistent chemokine signature. One exception to this observation is the response to high-MOI infection in A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, where replication was robust and an IFN-I and -III signature could be observed

  / May, 2020 - Cell
  let !c self assert = These ideas are supported by the fact that, at a low-MOI infection in A549-ACE2 cells, high levels of replication could also be achieved, but in the absence of IFN-I and -III induction. Taken together, these data suggest that, at low MOIs, the virus is not a strong inducer of the IFN-I and -III system, as opposed to conditions where the MOI is high. These dynamics are also likely to contribute to development of COVID-19 during the course of infection

  / May, 2020 - Cell
  let !d self assert = A recurrent observation in each of our systems is a robust production of cytokines and their subsequent transcriptional response. According to our longitudinal in vivo data, this response starts as early as 3 days after infection and continues beyond clearance of the virus.

  / May, 2020 - Cell
  let !e self assert = We found, in all of our systems, significant induction of monocyte-associated chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL8. In addition, our data suggest that neutrophils could also contribute to the disease observed in COVID-19 patients, as demonstrated by CXCL2 and CXCL8 induction. This is consistent with data showing elevated circulating neutrophil levels among COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020, Qin et al., 2020), which may have prognostic value for identifying individuals at risk for developing severe disease. It is also noteworthy that two of the cytokines uniquely elevated in response to SARS-CoV-2 are IL-6 and IL1RA, suggesting that there might be a parallel between COVID-19 and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a complication commonly seen following CAR T-cell treatment.Should this be true, drugs such as tocilizumab and anakinra may prove to be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19 (Norelli et al., 2018). Future studies will be needed to address this formally.

  / May, 2020 - Cell
  let !f self assert = Based on animal models, SARS-CoV-1 has been found to induce a robust cytokine response that generally shows a delay in IFN-I, culminating in improper recruitment of inflammatory monocyte-macrophage populations. This dynamic seems to be in line with what we observed with SARS-CoV-2 because low levels of IFN-I and -III are likely produced in response to infection. Given the moderate viral replication levels observed in vivo, one explanation for the low IFN expression could be that a small subset of cells is refractory to the antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, producing sufficient amounts of IFN-I and/or IFN-III to guide immune cell activation and ISG induction.

// IL-17A Attenuates IFN-λ Expression by Inducing Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Expression in Airway Epithelium
doi: https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800147
ref 'Niwa_et_al_10_15_2018
  head = Our data provide novel findings that IL-17A attenuates virus-induced IFN-λ expression through induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, which inhibits activation of JAK–STAT1 signaling in a positive autocrine feedback loop of IFN-λ expression in human airway epithelial cells. As airway IFN-λ plays pivotal roles in mucosal immune response to viral infection, restoring IFN-λ expression in chronic airway diseases, such as asthma and COPD, may thereby improve impaired host defense response to viral infection and prevent subsequent exacerbation. In this context, blockage of IL-17A or SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in the airway epithelium may constitute novel therapeutic strategies to prevent viral infection and exacerbation, especially for patients with severe asthma and COPD.

  >>> Abstract
    IFN-λ is a cytokine expressed in epithelial tissues and plays a central role in antiviral mucosal immune response. The expression of IFN-λ in the airway is impaired in chronic airway diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which renders patients susceptible to viral infection. IL-17A is associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis; however, IL-17A regulation of IFN-λ expression remains unclear. The aim of the current study is to clarify IL-17A–mediated regulatory mechanisms of IFN-λ expression in human airway epithelial cells. In this study, we have shown that polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and influenza A virus (IAV) infection increased IFN-λ expression at mRNA and protein levels in primary cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas IL-17A attenuated polyI:C- or IAV-induced IFN-λ expression. IFN-λ receptor 1 knockdown and a JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, attenuated polyI:C-induced IFN-λ expression, confirming that a positive autocrine feedback loop, the IFN-λ receptor–JAK–STAT pathway, was involved in IFN-λ expression. In Western blotting analysis, we demonstrated that polyI:C and IAV infection induced STAT1 phosphorylation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas IL-17A suppressed polyI:C- or IAV-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that cotreatment with IL-17A and polyI:C or IAV infection synergistically increased suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 and SOCS3 expression. SOCS1 small interfering RNA and SOCS3 small interfering RNA negated the inhibitory effect of IL-17A in polyI:C-induced IFN-λ expression by restoring attenuated STAT1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-17A attenuates virus-induced IFN-λ expression by enhancing SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression to inhibit autocrine signaling loops in human airway epithelial cells.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !f self assert = In this study, we have shown that IL-17A suppressed polyI:C- and IAV infection–induced IFN-λ production in NHBE cells. IL-17A is a cytokine that induces the expression of a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and mucins in airway epithelial cells and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD, including neutrophilic airway inflammation and airway remodeling (e.g., mucus metaplasia, airway fibrosis). Former studies have shown that elevated levels of IL-17A were found in patients with severe asthma and COPD, a group known to be more susceptible to viral infection than healthy subjects

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !g self assert = In addition, neutrophilic forms of asthma are associated with IL-17A, and these endotypes are generally severe and resistant to corticosteroid treatment.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !h self assert = Given that IFN-λ plays a central role in the mucosal host defense response against viral infection, attenuation of airway IFN-λ production by IL-17A, which constitutes a novel finding in this study, may thus represent one of the causes of defective antiviral immunity in chronic airway diseases, especially in severe neutrophilic asthma.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !i self assert = In addition, viral infection is the most common cause of acute exacerbation of asthma and COPD in clinical practice. Impairment of IFN-λ production would likely bring about a prolonged airway viral infection, which may provoke exacerbation of asthma and COPD. Thus, additional studies using animal models are required to determine whether elevated levels of IL-17A attenuate IFN-λ production and impair antiviral host defense response, resulting in exacerbation of asthma and COPD.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !j self assert = In addition, we found that not only direct activation of NF-κB and IRF3 but also positive feedback through the IFNLR–JAK–STAT1 pathway via an autocrine mechanism were involved in polyI:C-induced IFN-λ expression. In the time-course study, induction of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3 were observed at 2–48 h after polyI:C treatment. Analysis of the signaling pathways revealed that NF-κB and IFR3 were involved in IFN-λ induction from the early stage. Conversely, the positive feedback loop of the IFNLR–JAK–STAT1 pathway was mostly related to persistent IFN-λ expression after polyI:C treatment.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !k self assert = When IFN-λ is produced in epithelial cells, IFN-λ binds to the heterodimeric receptor, IFNLR/IL10RB, leading to activation of the JAK–STAT pathway, which induces the expression of ISGs. However, no study had been reported regarding the role of a positive autocrine/paracrine feedback loop in IFN-λ expression. The findings in this study clearly demonstrate that a positive autocrine feedback loop exists in IFN-λ expression in airway epithelial cells, which results in sustained increase of IFN-λ production and persistent antivirus immune response in airway epithelium.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !l self assert = Considering that IL-17A did not induce IFN-λ expression and had no additive effect on polyI:C-induced IFN-λ mRNA expression, it is reasonable that IL-17A–mediated NF-κB activation is not involved in IFN-λ expression.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !m self assert = In this study, we revealed that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 induced by cotreatment with IL-17A and polyI:C or IAV infection negatively regulated IFN-λ expression by inhibiting the JAK–STAT1 signaling pathway. As IFN-λ is critical to antiviral defense at epithelial surfaces, determining specific regulators of IFN-λ expression may thus lead to the development of new strategies for modulating epithelial antiviral host defense in the lung.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !n self assert = The findings of the current study, that IL-17A enhances SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression resulting in attenuation of IFN-λ production, provide a new aspect of the pathogenic role of IL-17A in chronic airway diseases. Defective antiviral defense response by impaired IFN-λ expression and excessive neutrophilic airway inflammation, both of which are mediated by IL-17A, may thereby cause virus-induced exacerbation of asthma and COPD.

  / October, 2020 - J Immunol
  let !o self assert = Based on the findings of the current study, elevated IL-17A expression in the airway, which is sometimes observed in patients with severe asthma, may cause attenuation of airway IFN-λ production, resulting in defective antiviral immunity.

  head = In summary, what we know about IFN-λ biology positions these cytokines as frontline defenses that protect our mucosal barriers from viral threats and contribute to the maintenance of an efficient barrier by finely modulating the immune response. Here, we discuss recent findings that establish the unique capacity of IFN-λ to act at the barriers of the host to balance tissue tolerance and immune resistance against viral and bacterial challenges. Further study of IFN-λ–specific signaling and of the nuances of IFN-λs direct and indirect modulation of inflammation is warranted to comprehend the full potential of IFN-λ.

  >>> Abstract
    Type III IFNs, or IFN-λ, are the newest members of the IFN family and were long believed to play roles that were redundant with those of type I IFNs. However, IFN-λ displays unique traits that delineate them as primary protectors of barrier integrity at mucosal sites. This unique role stems both from the restricted expression of IFN-λ receptor, confined to epithelial cells and to a limited pool of immune cells, and from unique immunomodulatory properties of IFN-λ. Here, we discuss recent findings that establish the unique capacity of IFN-λ to act at the barriers of the host to balance tissue tolerance and immune resistance against viral and bacterial challenges.

ref 'Merad_et_al_05_06_2020
  head = We describe the potentially pathological roles of macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss ongoing and prospective therapeutic strategies to modulate macrophage activation in patients with COVID-19. The exact drivers of pathological inflammation in COVID-19 remain to be identified, but it is crucial that we establish the pathways involved in the different stages of the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and determine the contribution of these pathways to ultimate disease outcome. The results of these studies should help identify not only the most relevant immunomodulatory strategies but also the optimal timing of such immunomodulatory interventions to maximize therapeutic effect.

  >>> Abstract
    The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 200,000 deaths worldwide. Several studies have now established that the hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV. Here we describe the potentially pathological roles of macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss ongoing and prospective therapeutic strategies to modulate macrophage activation in patients with COVID-19.

  let !a self assert = Hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19: Higher levels of inflammatory markers in blood (including C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimers), an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio1,12,13 and increased serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines3,14,15,16,17 have been associated with disease severity and death. The systemic cytokine profiles observed in patients with severe COVID-19 show similarities to those observed in cytokine release syndromes, such as macrophage activation syndrome, with increased production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-7 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and also of inflammatory chemokines including CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3 and CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), as well as of the soluble form of the α-chain of the IL-2 receptor. This has led to the hypothesis that dysregulated activation of the mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) compartment contributes to COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation.

Although it is possible that the reduced levels of circulating T cells in patients may reflect their massive recruitment to inflamed tissues or the use of steroid treatment to mitigate inflammation, some studies have reported significant T cell depletion from the secondary lymphoid organs of patients infected with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !d self assert = The potential mechanisms responsible for T cell depletion are still poorly understood but are not likely to be related to direct infection of T cells by the virus, at least in the case of patients with COVID-19 for which no evidence supports possible T cell infection by SARS-CoV-2

In situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining revealed high levels of lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleens and lymph nodes of patients who had died from COVID-19, and this was associated with increased expression of the death receptor FAS, suggesting that activation-induced cell death (AICD) may cause T cell lymphopenia10. Because T cells exert major functions in viral containment and clearance, further exploration to clarify whether T cell AICD is antigen-induced and/or increased by macrophage-derived cytokines such as IL-6 will be important.

Neither of these studies had control arms and very few data are available on the exact clinical and inflammatory status of patients who responded versus those who did not.

Accordingly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of BALF collected from patients with severe or mild COVID-19 revealed increased proportions of MNPs, with these cells accounting for as much as 80% of total BALF cells in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with only approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of total BALF cells in patients with mild disease or healthy controls.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !h self assert = MNP composition was further characterized by a depletion of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and an abundance of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in patients with severe disease. Inflammatory programmes seen in these macrophages24 were consistent with findings from bulk RNA-seq analysis of BALF23 from patients with severe COVID-19, and notably both studies identified a strong interferon gene signature. In addition, a subset of macrophages has been described in patients with COVID-19 that is enriched in genes associated with tissue repair and promotes fibrosis generation, such as is seen in liver cirrhosis. This suggests that the pathogenicity of infiltrating macrophages could extend beyond the promotion of acute inflammation and is also in line with the fibrotic complications observed in patients under mechanical ventilation.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !i self assert =  These results could suggest that pre-existing populations of tissue-resident memory T cells with potential cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 enable rapid control of the virus and protect against disease progression by limiting epithelial damage, local inflammation and accumulation of pathological macrophage populations. While this hypothesis remains to be addressed, epidemiological studies have reported that prior Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination may protect from COVID-19, leading several countries to launch clinical trials testing the protective benefit of intracutaneous administration of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine in health-care workers.

  let !j self assert = A significant expansion of populations of CD14+CD16+ monocytes producing IL-6 was also observed in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 in ICUs compared with those patients who did not require ICU hospitalization27,28, a finding also supported by scRNA-seq analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells29 and our personal observations

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !k self assert = immunostaining of post-mortem tissue from patients who had died from COVID-19 revealed that populations of CD169+ lymph node subcapsular and splenic marginal zone macrophages express the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and that these macrophages contained SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP)10. This finding is surprising given that scRNA-seq analysis of human tissues failed to identify ACE2 expression on most tissue-resident macrophages, including on secondary lymphoid tissue-resident macrophages

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !l self assert = It is also possible that additional receptors such as CD147 are involved in virus entry.  Although SARS-CoV-2 NP was detected in secondary lymphoid tissue macrophages10, it is still unclear whether the virus productively infected these cells or whether the NP positivity reflected macrophage uptake of other infected cells.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !m self assert = Macrophages that contained SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were found to express IL-6, and the presence of IL-6+ macrophages was associated with severe depletion of lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes7. CD68+NP+ macrophages were also observed in the kidneys of patients with COVID-19, and acute kidney tubular damage was associated with marked accumulation of monocytes and macrophages.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !n self assert = These preliminary findings in patients with COVID-19 are in line with the pathology observed in post-mortem tissues obtained from patients infected with SARS-CoV. The disease pathology seen in these patients is also characterized by damage to the lungs consistent with ARDS, focal necrosis and lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration into the lungs, heart, kidney, liver and muscles, as well as massive necrosis of the spleen and focal necrosis of lymph nodes.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !o self assert = Macrophage activation in SARS: Similar to what has been reported in SARS-CoV-2, high levels of interferon-γ (IFNγ), IL-6, IL-12, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL9 and IL-8 were reported in patients with SARS-CoV. However, in contrast to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, low levels of IL-10 and high levels of IL-1β were often detected in SARS-CoV. Of note, while infection of MNPs is abortive in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can replicate in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells4. As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were detected in MNPs but evidence of productive infection remains to be demonstrated.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !p self assert = The factors that drive severe lung pathology during infection with highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are poorly understood. Potential mechanisms include high rates of viral replication, which could be responsible for enhanced host cell cytolysis and the strong production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by infected epithelial cells; delayed induction of antiviral interferon responses owing to virus escape mechanisms, such as production of interferon inhibitory proteins, which perpetuates virual damage, leading to excessive accumulation of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs4; or modulation of the ACE2-mediated epithelial protective pathway upon virus binding to its receptors.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !a self assert = It is surprising that reduced interferon activity can persist in patients with COVID-19 who show massive inflammatory responses; this suggests that additional pathways, such as inflammasome activation, could contribute to the persistent low level of type I interferon induction. Identifying the exact mechanisms that contribute to reduced type I interferon activity will be critical for the development of targeted immunomodulatory strategies in patients with COVID-19.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !q self assert = Studies in animal models of virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI) suggest that several pathways drive pro-inflammatory programmes, including the infiltration of monocytes. Interestingly, however, deletion of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 receptor adaptor MYD88 had no effect on mouse ALI; in fact, a protective role of MYD88 was even reported, although protection was independent of IL-1 receptor engagement by IL-1β43. These experiments were conducted in mice with constitutive MYD88 deficiency and do not rule out a pathological function for MYD88-dependent TLR and IL-1β-mediated signalling in late stages of the disease. However, the temporal contribution of inflammasome-induced IL-1β to viral clearance and/or COVID-19 severity remains to be investigated.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !r self assert = Hypercoagulation and MNP activation: Importantly, lower platelets counts, increased levels of fibrin degradation products (known as D-dimers) and coagulation abnormalities are being increasingly associated with poor prognosis and could represent a main cause of organ failure and death in patients with severe COVID-19. Microthrombi of the lungs, lower limbs, hands, brain, heart, liver and kidneys have been described in patients with COVID-19. Notably, activation of coagulation and intravascular coagulation is a hallmark of organ injury in sepsis, where it is mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !s self assert = The initiation of inflammation-induced coagulation leading to an increased coagulation state is almost always mediated by the expression of the tissue factor (TF; also called CD142 or coagulation factor III) pathway. In addition, major natural anticoagulant pathways, such as antithrombin or TF pathway inhibitor, are almost always impaired during inflammation, contributing further to the propagation of coagulation. In the absence of vascular injury, the initiation of coagulation is completely dependent on the recruitment of TF-expressing inflammatory monocytes by activated endothelial cells.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !t self assert = It is also possible that oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) — which have been detected in the lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV38 — contribute to the process. OxPLs are produced following oxidative stress; they promote the induction of TF expression and inflammatory programmes in monocytes and activate endothelial cells to recruit and bind to monocytes. In experimental ALI, OxPLs trigger macrophage activation through the TLR4–TRIF–TRAF6–NF-κB pathway. Interfering with monocyte and/or endothelial cell activation in response to OxPLs could help prevent thrombotic complications, especially in patients with COVID-19 who have pre-existing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !u self assert = It is important to note that the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 is expressed on arterial and venous endothelial cells, where it plays an anti-inflammatory protective effect. Whether the increased coagulopathy observed in patients with COVID-19 is also partly due to direct vascular damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or ACE2 inhibition remains to be determined.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !v self assert = Therapeutic perspectives: Clinical trials to assess the benefits of inflammatory cytokine blockade targeting IL-6 and IL-1β alone or in combination are in progress (Table 1). Trials examining the blockade of additional myeloid-derived inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF57 and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM–CSF) (NCT04341116), have also been considered and/or initiated. Strategies aimed at broadly interfering with cytokine signalling could also significantly reduce hyperinflammation in patients with severe COVID-19, and several trials testing the use of JAK inhibitors are ongoing.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !w self assert = Current evidence suggests that pathological macrophages mostly derive from circulating monocytes that massively infiltrate the lungs and other organs rather than from tissue-resident macrophage populations. Circulating CD14+ monocytes require the chemokine receptor CCR2 to exit the bone marrow and to accumulate in inflamed tissues58,59. CCR2 blockade could potentially help to reduce the accumulation of pathological monocytes in inflamed tissues, although it is likely that redundant mechanisms independent of CCR2 may also contribute to monocyte accumulation in tissues during severe inflammation.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !x self assert = Trials targeting CCR5, another chemokine receptor that regulates monocyte and T cell migration, have been initiated in patients with COVID-19 who show mild-to-moderate symptoms of respiratory illness (NCT04343651). Although the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine remains uncertain, its immunomodulatory activity in chronic inflammatory diseases is well established.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !y self assert = Type I interferon (IFNαβ) receptors are ubiquitously expressed and type I interferons can drive antiviral effects but also induce the activation of immune cells that could potentially enhance tissue pathology. By contrast, type III interferon (also known as IFNλ) mainly targets epithelial cells as well as a restricted pool of immune cells, and could therefore promote a potent antiviral effect without enhancing pathological tissue inflammation. Inflammatory macrophages from the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a strong interferon signature and it is possible that, while interferon may be protective during the early stages of the disease, persistent IFNγ production could ultimately drive macrophage hyperactivation as is seen in macrophage activation syndrome. Trials exploring IFNγ blockade in patients with COVID-19 who show respiratory distress and hyperinflammation have been initiated (NCT04324021).

  / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
  let !z self assert = Current models of COVID-19 propose three distinct immune stages that are crucial for the ultimate disease course. In the first stage, early activation of the immune system through the induction of a potent interferon response is important to control the virus. In the second stage, a delayed interferon response may lead to progressive tissue damage. This may ultimately lead to the third stage, a deleterious hyperinflammation characterized by the excessive macrophage activation and coagulation that is seen in patients with severe disease, possibly followed by dysregulation of tissue repair mechanisms and fibrosis.

// Estimating the Global Infection Fatality Rate of COVID-19
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098780
ref 'Grewelle_et_al_05_18_2020
  head = The aim of this study was to provide a reliable metric that enables a robust estimate of the global IFR capturing a wide range of variation without accounting for underlying variability that is necessary to give point estimates of the IFR in each locality. Though we provide the first measurement, the estimate of a global IFR of 1.04% is dynamic and can be updated with incoming. Proper control measures and testing can minimize infection spikes to levels that hospitals can manage, reducing the IFR data.
  >>> Abstract
    COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, resulting in nearly three hundred thousand deaths distributed heterogeneously across countries. Estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) has been elusive due to the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections and lack of testing capacity. We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries' reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR.

  let !c self assert = Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !d self assert = Deviation of reported CFR by each country from the global mean estimated from the regression line does not necessarily reflect true differences in national IFR from the global IFR. There is little to no correlation between these deviations and GDP or age, which are considered proxies of risk for mortality from COVID-19. Instead, deviations likely represent variation in testing and reporting strategies. Additional variation can occur because COVID-19 associated deaths lag diagnosis, so countries early in an epidemic may report a lower than expected CFR.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !e self assert = Given results of this work that indicate the risk of death to be approximately 1% from COVID-19, which is higher than the risk of death in the same 2-3 week interval from common chronic comorbidities, the probability that a SARS-COV-2 positive death could be attributed to COVID-19 is higher than the probability the death could be attributed to other chronic comorbidities. In an estimate of 0.1% probability of mortality in a 2 week window due to existing comorbidities, the probability that death of an infected patient with a pre-existing condition is primarily due to the existing condition is less than 10% (SI 6). In this case, the reported CFR needs to be adjusted to 90% of its value. In light of this, the vast majority of SARS-COV2 positive deaths are due in whole or primarily to COVID-19.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !f self assert = High reported CFR values are a result of under-counting of positive infections rather than overcounting COVID-19 associated deaths. This contrasts needed adjustments in deaths associated with influenza, as the lower IFR of active influenza infections leads to a higher coincidence of mortality due to chronic disease and infection relative to the incidence of influenza associated mortality alone.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !g self assert = In some localities it is estimated that COVID-19 associated deaths are under-reported by 25-50% because these deaths occur outside of a hospital setting. Underreporting of deaths is likely to outweigh over-reporting due to comorbidities in many localities.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !h self assert = The remaining 45% of the variation in the data unexplained by the metric of testing capacity used here is likely explained by a mixture of variability in national reporting, testing strategies, and stage of the epidemic with select cases explained by demography, underlying health conditions, income, or availability of treatment. The methods provided in this work and the supplement are easy to translate to other studies when high quality data and independent samples are available. We hope this approach can be used to give updated estimates of the global IFR, as deaths due to infection often lag diagnosis.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !i self assert = Reported CFR values for some countries in this study are low due to the nascency of viral transmission in the country in April 2020. As more data becomes available for infections and COVID-19 deaths, case fatality rates can be more reliably approximated, which can be translated to a global IFR. Temporal or regional variation in testing strategy affects the relationship between CFR and testing capacity, therefore cumulative data collected at least 1 month after the first recorded COVID-19 death in each country better represents the relationship than point estimates.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !j self assert =  Of note, some countries have yet to report deaths, and more have yet to report the number of tests administered, including China. Failure to report these estimates impairs resolution of the global IFR, which is crucial in providing a predictive framework for epidemiologists and policy makers to inform appropriate control measures.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !k self assert = Though we provide the first measurement, the estimate of a global IFR of 1.04% is dynamic and can be updated with incoming data. This number is lower than the IFR for the Diamond Princess cruise (2%), whose demography was skewed toward older individuals. The older age of this sample may be partially counterbalanced by the higher income and access to healthcare of the majority of these individuals than the global average.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !l self assert = National surveys performed in Iceland have estimated an IFR below 0.6%, which is among the most randomized testing conducted in any nation, though much of these cases have affected a younger group than is representative of the nation.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !m self assert =  A previous estimate of IFR in China of 0.66% aligns well with projections from Iceland. Seroprevalence studies have inferred widely different estimates of IFR, including a non-random sample of Santa Clara county residents in CA that suggested an IFR of 0.12-0.2%. NYC seroprevalence of grocery shoppers suggests approximately one of every 5 NYC residents has been exposed. Because 0.15% of NYC residents had died from COVID-19 at the time the study was conducted, seroprevalence results yield a city-wide IFR of 0.75%.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !n self assert = Much of the current local estimates of IFR are representative of high income areas with high access to treatment. Higher IFR is possible in areas where surveys have not been conducted due to disparity in healthcare access or testing.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !o self assert = Most importantly, the realized IFR is dependent on healthcare capacity, which can vary with conditions of the pandemic. High case load can overwhelm hospital staff and resources, leading to high realized IFR. This is a possible explanation for the high departure of Italy’s reported CFR from the global estimate for equivalent testing capacity.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !p self assert = We estimate the IFR for Italy as 1.91% (SI 7), which is higher than a recent estimate of 1.29% provided by Rinaldi and Paradisi from early data but within their credible interval. The IFR for Italy is likely higher than for countries of equivalent GDP and healthcare access due to the spike in cases that occurred in March 2020 that exhausted hospital resources in the northern regions.

// Serology for SARS-CoV-2: Apprehensions, opportunities, and the path forward
doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abc6347
ref 'Bryant_et_al_05_19_2020
  head = This article discusses the use case for individual-level versus population-level serological testing, with a focus on IgG testing applications. We emphasize the dangers of using current serologic tests for individual-level risk assessments but highlight the potential power of deploying population-level serological testing (i.e., serosurveillance or seroepidemiology), even with assays of moderate sensitivity/specificity.

  >>> Abstract
    Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 has enormous potential to contribute to COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. However, the required performance characteristics of antibody tests will critically depend on the use case (individual level versus population level).

  let !a self assert = Serology tests with relatively high but imperfect specificity may lead to substantial false-positive results when used in low-incidence settings. For example, in a setting where 5% of the population has been infected, a test with 96% specificity and 90% sensitivity would lead to just 54% of positive results, indicating a true infection (i.e., positive predictive value).

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !b self assert = In addition to the risks of false positives, false negatives may occur in some previously infected persons who fail to produce antibodies specific to the antigens/epitopes in a given assay, or whose antibodies have already quickly waned, or, when used during an on-going epidemic, among those who have not yet mounted a specific antibody response. For these individuals that do not mount a measurable antibody response despite having been infected, obtaining permission to return to work could be onerous. Further considerations that may undermine the individual use case is that even with a true-positive antibody result, we do not know how well that translates to protection or immunity nor whether those positive by an antibody test could still shed virus and infect others.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !c self assert = At the population level, representative cross-sectional serosurveys can provide aggregate “snapshots” of infection history and immunity of a population. Understanding the proportion of the population infected by SARS-CoV-2 cannot be assessed on the basis of PCR-confirmed cases alone because of variations in testing practices, timing of sampling, and the clinical spectrum of disease (e.g., asymptomatic infections). In contrast to case data, seroepidemiological datasets provide a less biased picture of risk of death (infection fatality rate) and the amplitude of transmission in different populations and can highlight disparities in infection rates without typical health-seeking behavior biases.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !d self assert = Understanding age-specific or spatial distribution of susceptibility could guide policymakers about where to intervene and to what degree, by helping to answer questions such as: What IgG seroprevalence in children is acceptable to allow schools to open? Do infection attack rates differ between children and adults? Population-level surveys could also help estimate the probability and timing of future waves of disease, which will critically depend upon duration of immunity, measure the impact of interventions such as physical distancing or vaccination, and, in later stages, confirm the absence of transmission.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !e self assert = Optimal thresholds for sensitivity/specificity can be “tuned” depending on local prevalence and intended use of the assay. For example, when conducting a serosurvey in low-prevalence settings, to achieve better precision of point estimates of disease burden, the assay specificity should be prioritized, typically at the cost of sensitivity. This can be achieved by raising the cutoff value for the assay used, for example, by setting higher optical density readings as the threshold for positivity in an ELISA. Similarly, in a high-prevalence setting, test sensitivity should be prioritized at the cost of specificity. Thus, we recommend the consideration of multiple threshold values (cutoffs) for assays that can be flexibly used in different contexts.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !f self assert = While many SARS-CoV-2 serological assays may have insufficient performance characteristics (sensitivity/specificity) to warrant use at the individual level and the World Health Organization currently recommends restricting antibody testing to research use only, we argue that these imperfect tests may nevertheless provide highly valuable tools to address critical public health questions, such as the safety of relaxing stay-at-home orders or school closures or evaluations of alternative intervention measures. To fully realize the benefits of population-level seroepidemiological studies, a number of fundamental questions must be addressed, relating to test performance, the dynamics of antibody responses in relation to infection, and the link between antibody responses and immunity.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !g self assert = Serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 will only be capable of contributing to actionable public health information if serology measurements flow into efficient data pipelines. Scale-up of serological testing for pandemic response must therefore be accompanied by a governance model at the subnational, national, and international levels and by an operational research agenda that evaluates the utility of assays within specific contexts.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !h self assert = National-level governance will be required to provide oversight for sample collection and processing and linkage to personal data and to coordinate results analysis to the appropriate scale for policy relevance. Much like a national census is translated into infrastructure appropriations, serosurveillance could be used for resource allocations (and future vaccination efforts) to target transmission hotspots.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !i self assert = A host of ethical and privacy issues will need to be addressed; we suggest that serosurveillance platforms should incorporate broad consent, enabling future screening of serum collections for multiple biomarkers of public health concern beyond SARS-CoV-2 alone. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the value of transparency in disease surveillance for all nations. We see a role for international coordination of national seroepidemiology programs to facilitate standardizing methods and dissemination of results among national public health laboratories.

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !j self assert = In summary, seroepidemiological studies and integrated serosurveillance platforms are urgently needed to guide and tailor SARS-CoV-2 response efforts and will continue to be critical for mitigating postpandemic resurgence. Coordinated serosurveillance provides opportunities to combine control efforts for different diseases into one coordinated program; this may be particularly valuable to assess impact of the COVID-19 crisis on routine immunization programs

  / May, 2020 - Science Immunology
  let !k self assert = Platforms should be designed with a longer term vision beyond COVID-19, to generate capacity for “precision public health” to monitor additional major diseases, and provide insights into how disease occurrence is interrelated with other health risk factors. Last, we stress that investing now in a fundamental and operational research agenda will allow us to rapidly develop serosurveillance as a powerful tool for population-level public health; however, the complexity of using serological assays within low-prevalence settings to inform individual-based risk assessments, i.e., to inform decisions regarding return to work, is dangerously premature

  head = COVID-19 does not affect everyone equally. In the US, it is exposing inequities in the health system. Although the numbers of reported cases seem to be levelling off in New York City and other urban areas, perhaps evidence that social-distancing measures are beginning to have an effect, emerging morbidity and mortality data have already clearly demonstrated what many have feared: a pandemic in which the brunt of the effects fall on already vulnerable US populations, and in which the deeply rooted social, racial, and economic health disparities in the country have been laid bare.

  let !a self assert = Confirming existing disparities, within New York City and other urban centres, African American and other communities of colour have been especially affected by the COVID-10 pandemic. Across the country, deaths due to COVID-19 are disproportionately high among African Americans compared with the population overall. In Milwaukee, WI, three quarters of all COVID-19 related deaths are African American, and in St Louis, MO, all but three people who have died as a result of COVID-19 were African American.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !b self assert = Part of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of colour has been structural factors that prevent those communities from practicing social distancing. Minority populations in the US disproportionally make up “essential workers” such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, and health-care workers and custodial staff. "These front-line workers, disproportionately black and brown, then are typically a part of residentially segregated communities”, said Barber. “They dont have that privilege of quote unquote ‘staying at home’, connecting those individuals to the communities they are likely to be a part of because of this legacy of residential segregation, or structural racism in our major cities and most cities in the United States.”

  let !c self assert = The negative consequences of health disparities for people who live in rural areas in the US were already a problem before the pandemic. Underserved African Americans face higher HIV incidence and greater maternal and infant mortality rates. Undocumented Latino communities working in rural industries such as farming, poultry, and meat production often have no health insurance. Poor white communities have been badly hit by the opioid crisis and across rural areas, especially in the southern states, high rates of non-communicable diseases are driven by conditions such as obesity. With higher COVID-19 mortality among those with underlying health conditions, these areas could be hit hard.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !d self assert = 14 US states (mostly in the south and the Plains) have refused to accept the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion, leaving millions of the poorest and sickest Americans without access to health care, with the added effect of leaving many regional and local hospitals across the US closed or in danger of closing because of the high cost of medical care and a high proportion of rural uninsured and underinsured people. People with COVID-19 in those states will have poor access to the kind of emergency and intensive care they will need.

  let !e self assert = Native American populations also have disproportionately higher levels of underlying conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, that would make them particularly at risk of complications from COVID-19. Health care for Native American communities has a unique place in the US. As part of treaty obligations owed by the US government to tribal groups, the Indian Health Service (IHS) provides direct point of care health care for the 2·6 million Native Americans living on tribal reservations.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !f self assert = According to the IHS, there are currently 985 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on tribal reservations, and 536 cases in the Navajo Nation alone (the largest reservation). However, the IHSs ability to respond to the crisis might be limited: according to according to Kevin Allis, Chief Executive Officer of the National Congress of American Indians, the largest Native American advocacy organisation, the IHS has only 1257 hospital beds and 36 intensive care units, and many people covered by the IHS are hours away from the nearest IHS facility. The IHS also does not cover care from external providers. Although there is a provision of the CARES Act stimulus bill that is intended to cover those costs, it is unclear how effective it would be if someone covered by the IHS is transferred to a non-IHS facility.

  let !g self assert = At the national level, the response has varied widely by state, with many states that voted for Trump in 2016—notably Florida, Texas, and Georgia—responding to the emerging pandemic later and with more lax measures. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally, was slow to implement social-distancing measures and close non-essential businesses, and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered beaches closed by local authorities to be reopened on April 3. However, the trend has not been universal: in Ohio, Republican Governor Mike DeWine was swift in issuing orders to shut non-essential businesses and in responding to the crisis.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !h self assert = The federal response has also been overtly political. States with governors that Trump sees as political allies (such as Florida), have received the full measure of requested personal protective equipment from the federal stockpile, while states with governors whom Trump identifies as political enemies (such as New Yorks Cuomo, Oregons Jay Inslee, and Michigans Gretchen Whitmer, all Democrats) have received only a fraction of their requests.

  let !i self assert =  In distributing funds made available by the CARES Act, Trump also appears to be playing favourites: New York received only a fraction of the $30 billion hospital relief funds from the bill ($12 000 per patient), while other states much more lightly affected received more ($300 000 per patient in Montana and Nebraska, and more than $470 000 per patient in West Virginia, all states that voted for Trump in 2016).



# epidemic? origin? contact tracing, isolation- non pharma interventions, children
// Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30287-5
ref 'Bi_et_al_04_27_2020
  head = Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

  >>> Background
    Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.

  >>> Methods
    From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.

  >>> Findings
    Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6).

  >>> Interpretation
    Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

  let !a self assert = The mean age of the population was 45 years, and 307 (79%) of 391 cases were adults aged 30–69 years. and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204).At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (102 [26%] of 391) or moderate (254 [65%] of 391), and only 35 (9%) were severe. 330 (84%) of 391 cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while 25 (6%) of 391 had no signs or symptoms.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !b self assert = Compared to cases with mild symptoms, those with severe symptoms had a 41% (95% CI 24–60) longer time to recovery. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died. These deaths occurred 35–44 days from symptom onset and 27–33 days from confirmation; 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22).

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !c self assert = A larger proportion of cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were male (161 [55%] of 292 vs 24 [28%] of 87) and aged 20–69 years (266 [91%] of 292 vs 65 [75%] of 87) than were those detected through contact-based surveillance.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !d self assert = At the time of the first clinical assessment, 25 (29%) of 87 cases in the contact-based surveillance group did not have fever, and 17 (20%) of 87 had no symptoms. By contrast, 258 (88%) of 292 in the symptom-based surveillance group had fever, and only eight reported no symptoms.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !e self assert = In multiple logistic regression, male sex was associated with severe symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2·5 [95% CI 1·1–6·1]). The probability of severe symptoms increased slightly with age, although only individuals aged 60–69 years had a significantly increased risk compared with the reference category, individuals aged 50–59 years (OR 3·4 [95% 1·4–9·5]).

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !f self assert = Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7).

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !g self assert = Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !h self assert = Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected, we found that the secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8) among household contacts and 6·6% (5·4–8·1) overall (the secondary attack rate increased to 14·9% [12·1–18·2] among household contacts and 9·7% [7·9–11·8] overall if those with missing results were removed from the denominator). In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, household contact (OR 6·3; 95% CI 1·5–26·3) and travelling together (OR 7·1; 1·4–34·9) were significantly associated with infection. Reporting contact that occurred often was also associated with increased risk of infection compared with moderate-frequency contact (OR 8·8; 95% CI 2·6–30·1; table 3).

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !i self assert = Cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed on average 5·5 days (95% CI 5·0–5·9) after symptom onset (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2), whereas those detected by contact-based surveillance were confirmed on average 3·2 days (95% CI 2·7–3·8) after symptom onset. 17 (5%) of 342 cases with a known onset date and start date of quarantine were isolated before developing symptoms. Among those isolated after developing symptoms, the symptom-based surveillance group was, on average, isolated 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after symptom onset, whereas the contact-based surveillance group was isolated 2·7 days (2·1–3·3) after symptom onset. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2·3-day (95% CI 1·5–3·0) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1·9-day (1·1–2·7) decrease in time to isolation.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !j self assert = We observed some indication of elevated attack rates in older age groups. Notably, the rate of infection in children younger than 10 years (7·4%) was similar to the population average (6·6%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !k self assert = 95% of secondary cases were expected to develop symptoms within 14·3 days (95% CI 11·1–17·6) of their infector. This estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infected individual was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3·6 days, increasing to 8·1 days if the infected individual was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !l self assert = The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (ie, the observed reproductive number, R), was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5). The distribution of individual R values was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8·9% (95% CI 3·5–10·8) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0·58; 95% CI 0·35–1·18).

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !m self assert = We found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0·4, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5·5 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset.

  / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
  let !n self assert = Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (eg, if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R0=2·6, the cases captured by surveillance must, if not isolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone

// Presenting Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Outcomes Among 5700 Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in the New York City Area
doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6775
ref 'Richardson_et_al_04_22_2020
  head = This study represents the first large case series of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area, US. Older persons, men, and those with pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes were highly prevalent in this case series and the pattern was similar to data reported from China. However, mortality rates in this case series were significantly lower, possibly due to differences in thresholds for hospitalization. This study reported mortality rates only for patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death), and longer-term study may find different mortality rates as different segments of the population are infected. The findings of high mortality rates among ventilated patients are similar to smaller case series reports of critically ill patients in the US.

  >>> Importance
    There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

  >>> Objective
    To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a US health care system.

  >>> Design, Setting, and Participants
    Case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system. The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates.

  >>> Exposures
    Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission.

  >>> Main Outcomes and Measures
    Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected.

  >>> Results
    A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range (IQR), 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2%), 38 (3.3%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5%) died, and 831 (72.2%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).

  >>> Conclusions and Relevance
    This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.

  head = By precisely investigating and anatomically mapping oro- and pharyngeal regions and brains of 32 patients dying from COVID-19, we not only describe CNS infarction due to cerebral thromboembolism, but also demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. SARS-CoV-2 enters the nervous system via trespassing the neuro-mucosal interface in the olfactory mucosa by exploiting the close vicinity of olfactory mucosal and nervous tissue including delicate olfactory and sensitive nerve endings- thus explaining some of the well-documented neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients including alterations of smell and taste perception. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 follows defined neuroanatomical structures, penetrating defined neuroanatomical areas, including the primary respiratory and cardiovascular control center in the medulla oblongata.

  >>> Abstract
    The newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a pandemic respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. Moreover, thromboembolic events throughout the body including the central nervous system (CNS) have been described. Given first indication for viral RNA presence in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid and in light of neurological symptoms in a large majority of COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2-penetrance of the CNS is likely. By precisely investigating and anatomically mapping oro- and pharyngeal regions and brains of 32 patients dying from COVID-19, we not only describe CNS infarction due to cerebral thromboembolism, but also demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. SARS-CoV-2 enters the nervous system via trespassing the neuro-mucosal interface in the olfactory mucosa by exploiting the close vicinity of olfactory mucosal and nervous tissue including delicate olfactory and sensitive nerve endings. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 follows defined neuroanatomical structures, penetrating defined neuroanatomical areas, including the primary respiratory and cardiovascular control center in the medulla oblongata.

Similarly, microthrombotic events were also detectable in the olfactory mucosa.

  let !b self assert = Assessment of viral load by means of RT-qPCR in regionally well-defined tissue samples including olfactory mucosa (region (R1), olfactory bulb (R2), oral mucosa (uvula; R3), trigeminal ganglion (R4) and medulla oblongata (R5) demonstrated highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 copies per cell within the olfactory mucosa sampled directly beneath the cribriform plate (N=13 of 22). Lower levels of viral RNA were found in the cornea, conjunctiva and oral mucosa, highlighting the oral and ophthalmic routes as additional potential sites of SARS-CoV-2 CNS entry. Only in few cases the cerebellum was also positive (N=2 of 21), while the wall of the internal carotid artery, which served as an internal negative control, was found to be negative in all investigated cases.

  let !c self assert = Patients with shorter disease duration were more likely to be tested positive for viral RNA in the CNS tissue.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !d self assert = The anatomical proximity between neurons, nerve fibers and mucosa within the oro- and nasopharynx and the reported clinical-neurological signs related to alteration in smell and taste perception suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exploits this neuro-mucosal interface as port of CNS entry. On the apical side of the olfactory mucosa, dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) project into the nasal cavity, while on the basal side axons of olfactory receptor neurons merge into fila, which protrude through the cribriform plate directly into the olfactory bulb, thereby also having contact with the CSF.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !e self assert = Cells of the olfactory mucosa showed strong immunoreactivity in a characteristic perinuclear pattern when an antibody against the SARS-CoV spike protein was used. Furthermore, early activated macrophages formed small cell clusters in the epithelium expressing myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP14), initiating and regulating an immune cascade, which e.g. upon influenza virus infection, has been shown to orchestrate virus-associated inflammation by acting as endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), ultimately initiating TLR4-MyD88 signalling.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !f self assert = Additional support for SARS-CoV-2 persistence was provided by ultrastructural analyses of ultrathin sections. We found Coronavirus-like particles – despite subtle ultrastructural differences compared to coronavirus derived from infected cell cultures providing a somewhat different milieu - fulfilling the criteria of size, shape, substructure (membrane, surface projections and internal electron dense material, resembling ribonucleoprotein) and intracellular localization of Coronavirus particles, while being clearly distinct from intrinsic cellular structures resembling Coronavirus particles

  let !g self assert = The presence of genuine virus in the olfactory mucosa with its delicate olfactory and sensitive – partially axonally damaged nerves in conjunction with SARS CoV-2 RNA manifestation preferentially in those neuroanatomical areas receiving olfactory tract projections may speak in favor of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion occurring via axonal transport. However, several other mechanisms or routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), or combinations thereof, be it in addition or exclusive, cannot be excluded at present.

  let !h self assert = The detection of - compared to values measured in the lower respiratory tract - persistently high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the olfactory mucosa (124% as mean value compared to lower respiratory tract) up to 53 days after initial symptoms, including the detection of sgRNA suggests that olfactory mucosa remains a region of continuous SARS-CoV-2 replication and persistence, thus enabling a constant viral replenishment for the CNS.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = In line with our findings there is a comparable SARS-CoV-2 infection gradient from the nose to the lungs which is paralleled by expression of the receptor molecule ACE228. Although this remains to be speculation and widespread dysregulation of homeostasis of cardiovascular, pulmonal and renal systems has to be regarded as the leading cause in fatal COVID-19 cases, previous findings of SARS-CoV infection and other coronaviruses in the nervous system as well as the herein described presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the medulla oblongata comprising the primary respiratory and cardiovascular control center bring to mind the possibility that SARS-CoV2  infection, at least in some instances, can aggravate respiratory or cardiac problems - or even cause failure - in a CNS-mediated manner.

 / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
 let !j self assert = Even when following distinct routes upon first CNS entry and - based on our findings - in the absence of clear signs of widespread distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS (i.e. no signs of meningitis/encephalitis in COVID-19 cases), it cannot be excluded that the virus may spread more widely to other brain regions, thus eventually contributing to a more severe or even chronic disease course, depending on various factors such as the time of virus persistence, viral load, and immune status, amongst others.



# neuropilins are emerging targets- research and treatment of COVID-19, viral entry, therapeutic frontier
// Neuropilin-1 is a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.134114
ref 'Daly_et_al_06_05_2020
  head =  Our data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to cell surface receptor NRP1 via the S1 CendR motif generated by the furin cleavage of S1/S2. This interaction promotes infection by SARS-CoV-2 in physiologically relevant cell lines widely used in the study of COVID-19. The molecular basis for the effect is unclear, but neuropilins are known to mediate the internalisation of CendR ligands through an endocytic process resembling macropinocytosis, and additionally serve as activators of receptor tyrosine kinases to mediate cell signalling. S1 binding to NRP1 may therefore contribute to viral entry and survival within the host cell. Taken together, we conclude that neuropilins are emerging targets in the urgent research and treatment of COVID-19 and, more broadly, important host factors to be considered in the wider context of viral entry mechanisms.

  >>> Abstract
    SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, a coronavirus disease that has infected more than 6.6 million people and caused over 390,000 deaths worldwide. The Spike (S) protein of the virus forms projections on the virion surface responsible for host cell attachment and penetration. This viral glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor in infected cells and, to be active, must be cleaved to two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2. For SARS-CoV-2 the cleavage is catalysed by furin, a host cell protease, which cleaves the S protein precursor at a specific sequence motif that generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (RRAR) C-terminal sequence on S1. This sequence motif conforms to the C-end rule (CendR), which means that the C-terminal sequence may allow the protein to associate with cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors. Here we demonstrate using immunoprecipitation, site-specific mutagenesis, structural modelling, and antibody blockade that, in addition to engaging the known receptor ACE2, S1 can bind to NRP1 through the canonical CendR mechanism. This interaction enhances infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provides a therapeutic target for COVID-19.

  let !a self assert = A striking difference in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is the presence, in the former, of a polybasic sequence motif, RRAR, at the S1/S2 boundary. It provides a cleavage site for a proprotein convertase, furin, a membrane-bound host cell protease.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !a self assert = We noticed that the C-terminus of the S1 protein generated by furin has a polybasic amino acid sequence (682RRAR685), that conforms to a [R/K]XX[R/K] motif, termed the ‘C-end rule’ (CendR). CendR motifs bind to neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, dimeric transmembrane receptors that regulate pleiotropic biological processes, including axon guidance, angiogenesis and vascular permeability.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !b self assert = That deletion of the terminal 682RRAR685 residues reduced S protein binding indicated the association largely depended on the CendR motif. Residual binding was observed with the ΔRRAR mutant indicating an additional CendR-independent association between Nrp1 and the S1 protein.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !c self assert = To establish the functional relevance of this interaction, we first generated HeLa wild type and NRP1 knock out cell lines stably expressing ACE2, designated as HeLaWT+ACE2 and HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2, respectively. Infection was visualized and quantified by staining with an anti-SARS nucleocapsid (N) polyclonal antibody. The percentage of infected cells was 73% lower in the HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2 cells compared to HeLaWT+ACE2 cells.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !d self assert = We also noted that SARS-CoV-2-infected HeLaWT+ACE2 cells displayed a distinct multi-nucleated syncytia cell pattern, as reported by others. Of infected HeLaWT+ACE2 cells, the majority (83%) formed syncytia while in HeLaNRP1KO+ACE2 cells this multi-nucleated cell phenotype was less prevalent. Together these data establish that NRP1 promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !e self assert = Based on this model, we investigated whether two key residues (R685 of S1 and T316 of NRP1) contributed to the interaction between S1 and NRP1. Site-directed mutagenesis of R685 of S1493-685 to aspartic acid reduced S1 association with the NRP1 b1 domain by greater than 75 %. Site-directed mutagenesis of T316 to arginine within mCherry-b1 reduced association with GFP-S1493-685, morethan 80%, consistent with its inhibitory impact on VEGF-A164 binding.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !f self assert = To evaluate the interaction of NRP1 with trimeric S on the surface of virions, we incubated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviral particles harbouring SARS-CoV-2 S protein with wild type mCherry-b1 or mCherry-b1(T316R) immobilised on mCherry-nanotrap beads. Wild type mCherry-b1 immunoprecipitated proteins that could correspond to processed forms of S1, whereas the T316R mutant did not.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !g self assert =  When these cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2, viral infection was significantly enhanced in cells expressing NRP1-GFP compared toGFP control, whereas cells expressing the T316R mutant failed to rescue infection. This established that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 CendR (682RRAR685) and NRP1 interaction promotes infection.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !h self assert =  All three monoclonal antibodies bound to the NRP1 b1b2 domain but only mAb#3 bound to the CendR-binding pocket, as defined by a reduced ability to bind to a b1b2 mutant that targets residues (S346, E348, T349) at the opening of the binding pocket12. All three monoclonal antibodies displayed staining by immunofluorescence in NRP1-expressing PPC-1 human primary prostate cancer cells but not in M21 human melanoma cells that do not express NRP1.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = Using mAb#3 and a control monoclonal antibody targeting avian influenza A virus (H11N3) hemagglutinin we found that mAb#3 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells by 38%.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !j self assert = A SARS-CoV-2 virus with a natural deletion of the S1/S2 furin cleavage site demonstrated attenuated pathogenicity in hamster models, causing less alveolar damage. NRP1 binding to the CendR-motif in S1 is thus likely to play a role in the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. The interaction between S1 and NRP1 can be reduced by monoclonal antibodies that bind to the CendR-binding pocket of NRP1 b1. Disrupting CendR-peptide binding to neuropilins by antibodies and oligopeptide/peptidomimetics has been recognised as a potential anti-cancer strategy, and the same approach may provide a route to COVID-19 therapies.

  let !a self assert = Detection of Viral RNA by RT-PCR: In most individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab as measured by the cycle threshold (Ct) becomes detectable as early as day 1 of symptoms and peaks within the first week of symptom onset. The Ct is the number of replication cycles required to produce a fluorescent signal, with lower Ct values representing higher viral RNA loads. A Ct value less than 40 is clinically reported as PCR positive. This positivity starts to decline by week 3 and subsequently becomes undetectable.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !b self assert = However, the Ct values obtained in severely ill hospitalized patients are lower than the Ct values of mild cases, and PCR positivity may persist beyond 3 weeks after illness onset when most mild cases will yield a negative result. However, a “positive” PCR result reflects only the detection of viral RNA and does not necessarily indicate presence of viable virus.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !c self assert = In some cases, viral RNA has been detected by RT-PCR even beyond week 6 following the first positive test. A few cases have also been reported positive after 2 consecutive negative PCR tests performed 24 hours apart. It is unclear if this is a testing error, reinfection, or reactivation.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !d self assert =  In a study of 9 patients, attempts to isolate the virus in culture were not successful beyond day 8 of illness onset, which correlates with the decline of infectivity beyond the first week.3 That is in part why the “symptom-based strategy” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that health care workers can return to work, if “at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and, at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.”

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !e self assert = The timeline of PCR positivity is different in specimens other than nasopharyngeal swab. PCR positivity declines more slowly in sputum and may still be positive after nasopharyngeal swabs are negative. In one study, PCR positivity in stool was observed in 55 of 96 (57%) infected patients and remained positive in stool beyond nasopharyngeal swab by a median of 4 to 11 days, but was unrelated to clinical severity.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !f self assert =  False-negative results mainly occurred due to inappropriate timing of sample collection in relation to illness onset and deficiency in sampling technique, especially of nasopharyngeal swabs. Specificity of most of the RT-PCR tests is 100% because the primer design is specific to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Occasional false-positive results may occur due to technical errors and reagent contamination.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !g self assert = Detection of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2: The most sensitive and earliest serological marker is total antibodies, levels of which begin to increase from the second week of symptom onset.6 Although IgM and IgG ELISA have been found to be positive even as early as the fourth day after symptom onset, higher levels occur in the second and third week of illness.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !h self assert = ELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests have greater than 95% specificity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Testing of paired serum samples with the initial PCR and the second 2 weeks later can further increase diagnostic accuracy.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !i self assert = Typically, the majority of antibodies are produced against the most abundant protein of the virus, which is the NC. Therefore, tests that detect antibodies to NC would be the most sensitive. However, the receptor-binding domain of S (RBD-S) protein is the host attachment protein, and antibodies to RBD-S would be more specific and are expected to be neutralizing. Therefore, using one or both antigens for detecting IgG and IgM would result in high sensitivity.7 Antibodies may, however, have cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV and possibly other coronaviruses.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !j self assert = Rapid point-of-care tests are purely qualitative in nature and can only indicate the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

  / May, 2020 - JAMA
  let !k self assert = The presence of neutralizing antibodies can only be confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, high titers of IgG antibodies detected by ELISA have been shown to positively correlate with neutralizing antibodies.7 The long-term persistence and duration of protection conferred by the neutralizing antibodies remains unknown.

ref 'Watson_et_al_05_12_2020
  head = Interpreting the result of a test for covid-19 depends on two things: the accuracy of the test, and the pre-test probability or estimated risk of disease before testing. A positive RT-PCR test for covid-19 test has more weight than a negative test because of the test’s high specificity but moderate sensitivity. A single negative covid-19 test should not be used as a rule-out in patients with strongly suggestive symptoms. Clinicians should share information with patients about the accuracy of covid-19 tests

  let !a self assert = No test gives a 100% accurate result; tests need to be evaluated to determine their sensitivity and specificity, ideally by comparison with a “gold standard.” The lack of such a clear-cut “gold-standard” for covid-19 testing makes evaluation of test accuracy challenging.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !b self assert = A systematic review of the accuracy of covid-19 tests reported false negative rates of between 2% and 29% (equating to sensitivity of 71-98%), based on negative RT-PCR tests which were positive on repeat testing.6 The use of repeat RT-PCR testing as gold standard is likely to underestimate the true rate of false negatives, as not all patients in the included studies received repeat testing and those with clinically diagnosed covid-19 were not considered as actually having covid-19.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !c self assert = Accuracy of viral RNA swabs in clinical practice varies depending on the site and quality of sampling. In one study, sensitivity of RT-PCR in 205 patients varied, at 93% for broncho-alveolar lavage, 72% for sputum, 63% for nasal swabs, and only 32% for throat swabs. Accuracy is also likely to vary depending on stage of disease and degree of viral multiplication or clearance. Higher sensitivities are reported depending on which gene targets are used, and whether multiple gene tests are used in combination. Reported accuracies are much higher for in vitro studies, which measure performance of primers using coronavirus cell culture in carefully controlled conditions.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !d self assert = The lack of a clear-cut “gold-standard” is a challenge for evaluating covid-19 tests; pragmatically, clinical adjudication may be the best available “gold standard,” based on repeat swabs, history, and contact with patients known to have covid-19, chest radiographs, and computed tomography scans. Inevitably this introduces some incorporation bias, where the test being evaluated forms part of the reference standard, and this would tend to inflate the measured sensitivity of these tests. Disease prevalence can also affect estimates of accuracy: tests developed and evaluated in populations with high prevalence (eg, secondary care) may have lower sensitivity when applied in a lower prevalence setting (eg, primary care).

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !e self assert = Sensitivity is the proportion of patients with disease who have a positive test, or the true positive rate. Specificity is the proportion of patients without disease who have a negative test, or true negative rate. These terms describe the operating characteristics of a test and can be used to gauge the credibility of a test result. They can be combined to calculate likelihood ratios, which are dimensionless numbers that indicate the strength of a positive or negative test result

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !f self assert = For calculating probabilities, a likelihood ratio can be used as a multiplier to convert pre-test odds to post-test odds. Positive likelihood ratios greater than 1 are progressively stronger, with 10 representing a very strong positive test result. Negative likelihood ratios less than 1 are also progressively stronger, with 0.1 representing a very strong negative test result. In the case of the nasopharyngeal swab RNA test for covid-19, the positive likelihood ratio is about 14, which is excellent.6 A positive covid-19 test result should be very compelling. The negative likelihood ratio is 0.3, which is a moderate result, but not nearly as compelling as a positive result because of the moderate sensitivity (about 70%) of the covid-19 test.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !g self assert = Interpretation of a test result depends not only on the characteristics of the test itself but also on the pre-test probability of disease. Clinicians use a heuristic (a learned mental short cut) called anchoring and adjusting to settle on a pre-test probability (called the anchor). They then adjust this probability based on additional information. This heuristic is a useful short cut but comes with the potential for bias. When people fail to estimate the pre-test probability and only respond to a piece of new information, they commit a fallacy called base-rate neglect.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !h self assert = Another fallacy called anchoring is failing adequately to adjust one’s probability estimate, given the strength of new information. Likelihood ratios can give a clinician an idea of how much to adjust their probability estimates.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !i self assert = Clinician’s thinking about a patient’s probability should shift, based on either a positive or negative test result for covid-19. First, the clinician should estimate a pre-test probability, using knowledge of local rates of covid-19 infection from national and regional data and patients’ symptoms and signs, likelihood of alternative diagnoses, and history of exposure to covid=19. After choosing a pre-test probability on the x axis, one should then trace up to either the upper curve for a positive test result or the lower curve for a negative test result, then trace over to the y axis to read the estimate for post-test probability.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !j self assert = A single negative test result may not be informative if the pre-test probability is high. Pre-test probability is high in someone with typical symptoms of covid-19, an occupational risk of exposure, and working in a high prevalence region, and negative test results can therefore be misleading.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !k self assert = A possible alternative diagnosis will reduce the pre-test probability- This patient has an alternative possible diagnosis: community-acquired pneumonia. Given her lack of other risk factors or clinical symptoms, and chest radiography findings we therefore estimate her pre-test probability at about 50%. One negative test reduces this risk to 24%, the patient therefore has an additional independently sampled nasopharyngeal swab RNA test which was negative, giving a post-test probability after two negative tests of less than 10%. She is treated with antibiotics and continues to recover.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !l self assert = Clinicians should ensure that patients are counselled about the limitations of tests. Patients with a single negative test but strongly suggestive symptoms of covid-19 should be advised to self-isolate in keeping with guidelines for suspected covid-19.

  / May, 2020 - BMJ
  let !m self assert = Serology tests, which detect immunoglobulins including IgG and IgM, are under development, with the aim of detecting individuals who have had previous infection and therefore theoretically developed immunity. False positive serology tests could cause false reassurance, behaviour change, and disease spread. If suitable accuracy can be established, the benefits of these antibody tests include establishing when healthcare workers are immune, helping to inform decisions about the lifting of lockdowns, and allowing the population to return to work.

ref 'Woloshin_et_al_06_05_2020
  head = Diagnostic testing will help in safely opening the country, but only if the tests are highly sensitive and validated under realistic conditions against a clinically meaningful reference standard. Measuring test sensitivity in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority. It will also be important to develop methods (e.g., prediction rules) for estimating the pretest probability of infection (for asymptomatic and symptomatic people) to allow calculation of post-test probabilities after positive or negative results. Negative results even on a highly sensitive test cannot rule out infection if the pretest probability is high, so clinicians should not trust unexpected negative results (i.e., assume a negative result is a “false negative” in a person with typical symptoms and known exposure). It’s possible that performing several simultaneous or repeated tests could overcome an individual test’s limited sensitivity; however, such strategies need validation.

  let !a self assert = The FDA prefers the use of “natural clinical specimens” but has permitted the use of “contrived specimens” produced by adding viral RNA or inactivated virus to leftover clinical material. Ordinarily, test-performance studies entail having patients undergo an index test and a “reference standard” test determining their true state. Clinical sensitivity is the proportion of positive index tests in patients who in fact have the disease in question. Sensitivity, and its measurement, may vary with the clinical setting. For a sick person, the reference-standard test is likely to be a clinical diagnosis, ideally established by an independent adjudication panel whose members are unaware of the index-test results. For SARS-CoV-2, it is unclear whether the sensitivity of any FDA-authorized commercial test has been assessed in this way.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !b self assert = Designing a reference standard for measuring the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 tests in asymptomatic people is an unsolved problem that needs urgent attention to increase confidence in test results for contact-tracing or screening purposes. Simply following people for the subsequent development of symptoms may be inadequate, since they may remain asymptomatic yet be infectious. Assessment of clinical sensitivity in asymptomatic people had not been reported for any commercial test as of June 1, 2020.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !c self assert = In a preprint systematic review of five studies (not including the Yang and Zhao studies), involving 957 patients (“under suspicion of Covid-19” or with “confirmed cases”), false negatives ranged from 2 to 29%.4 However, the certainty of the evidence was considered very low because of the heterogeneity of sensitivity estimates among the studies, lack of blinding to index-test results in establishing diagnoses, and failure to report key RT-PCR characteristics.4 Taken as a whole, the evidence, while limited, raises concern about frequent false negative RT-PCR results.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !d self assert = If SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were perfect, a positive test would mean that someone carries the virus and a negative test that they do not. With imperfect tests, a negative result means only that a person is less likely to be infected. To calculate how likely, one can use Bayes’ theorem, which incorporates information about both the person and the accuracy of the test. For a negative test, there are two key inputs: pretest probability — an estimate, before testing, of the person’s chance of being infected — and test sensitivity. Pretest probability might depend on local Covid-19 prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 exposure history, and symptoms. Ideally, clinical sensitivity and specificity of each test would be measured in various clinically relevant real-life situations (e.g., varied specimen sources, timing, and illness severity).

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !e self assert = Assume that an RT-PCR test was perfectly specific (always negative in people not infected with SARS-CoV-2) and that the pretest probability for someone who, say, was feeling sick after close contact with someone with Covid-19 was 20%. If the test sensitivity were 95% (95% of infected people test positive), the post-test probability of infection with a negative test would be 1%, which might be low enough to consider someone uninfected and may provide them assurance in visiting high-risk relatives. The post-test probability would remain below 5% even if the pretest probability were as high as 50%, a more reasonable estimate for someone with recent exposure and early symptoms in a “hot spot” area.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !f self assert = But sensitivity for many available tests appears to be substantially lower: the studies cited above suggest that 70% is probably a reasonable estimate. At this sensitivity level, with a pretest probability of 50%, the post-test probability with a negative test would be 23% — far too high to safely assume someone is uninfected.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !g self assert = Shows how the post-test probability of infection varies with the pretest probability for tests with low (70%) and high (95%) sensitivity. The threshold highlights why very sensitive diagnostic tests are needed. With a negative result on the low-sensitivity test, the threshold is exceeded when the pretest probability exceeds 15%, but with a high-sensitivity test, one can have a pretest probability of up to 33% and still, assuming the 5% threshold, be considered safe to be in contact with others.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !h self assert = The graph also highlights why efforts to reduce pretest probability (e.g., by social distancing, possibly wearing masks) matter. If the pretest probability gets too high (above 50%, for example), testing loses its value because negative results cannot lower the probability of infection enough to reach the threshold.

  / June, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !i self assert = Finally, thresholds for ruling out infection need to be developed for a variety of clinical situations. Since defining these thresholds is a value judgement, public input will be crucial.

// A Novel Bat Coronavirus Closely Related to SARSCoV-2 Contains Natural Insertions at the S1/S2 Cleavage Site of the Spike Protein
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.023
ref 'Zhou_et_al_06_08_2020
  head = Our study reaffirms that bats, particularly those of the genus Rhinolophus, are important natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and currently harbor the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2, although this picture may change with increased wildlife sampling. In this context it is striking that the RmYN02 virus identified here in Rhinolophus malayanus is the closest relative of SARSCoV-2 in the long 1ab replicase gene, although the virus itself has a complex history of recombination. Finally, the observation that RmYN02 contains an insertion of multiple amino acids at the S1/S2 cleavage site in the spike protein clearly indicates that events of this kind are a natural and expected component of coronavirus evolution.

  >>> Summary
    The unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China and beyond has had major public health impacts on a global scale. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomic analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses.

From this, we generated two preliminary consensus sequences. After a series of verification steps, including re-mapping, one partial (23,395 bp) and one complete (29,671 bp) beta-CoV genome sequences were obtained and named BetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN01/2019 (RmYN01) and BetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN02/2019 (RmYN02), respectively.

In contrast, RmYN02 was closely related to SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting 93.3% nucleotide sequence identity, although it was less similar to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13 (96.1%) across the genome as a whole.

  let !g self assert = The amino acid deletions in RmYN02 RBD made two loops near the receptor binding site that are shorter than those in SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, the conserved disulfide bond in the external subdomain of SARS-CoV (PDB: 2DD8), SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LZG), RaTG13, pangolin/MP789/2019, and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017 was missing in RmYN02.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !h self assert = We speculate that these deletions may cause conformational variations and consequently reduce the binding of RmYN02 RBD with ACE2 or even cause non-binding. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions, including RmYN02, ZXC21, and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor. In contrast, RaTG13, pangolin/MP789/2019, and pangolin/P5L/2017 did not have the deletions, and had similar conformations at their external domains, indicating that they may also use ACE2 as cell receptor, although with the exception of pangolin/MP789/2019, all exhibited amino acid variation to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus showed highly structural homology with SARSCoV-2.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !i self assert = Six amino acid residues at the RBD (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505) have been reported to be major determinants of efficient receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. As noted above, and consistent with the homology modeling, pangolin/MP789/2019 possessed the identical amino acid residues to SARS-CoV-2 at all six positions. In contrast, RaTG13, RmYN02, and RmYN01 possessed the same amino acid residue as SARS-CoV-2 at only one of the six positions each (RaTG13, L455; RmYN02, Y505; RmYN01, Y505), despite RaTG13 being the closest relative in the spike protein. Such an evolutionary pattern is indicative of a complex combination of recombination and natural selection.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !j self assert = Notably, SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a four amino-acid insertion at the junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs. This insertion, which represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and is present in all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in RmYN02 is therefore of major importance. Although the inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats) strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely been acquired by recombination. As such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !k self assert = Consistent with previous research, the pangolin beta-CoVs formed two well-supported sub-lineages, representing animal seized by anti-smuggling authorities in Guangxi (pangolin-CoV/GX) and Guangdong (pangolin-CoV/GD) provinces. However, whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these viruses, or they acquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife, requires further sampling.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !l self assert = More notable was that RmYN02 was the closest relative of SARSCoV-2 in most of the virus genome, although these two viruses were still separated from each other by a relatively long branch length. In the spike gene tree, SARSCoV-2 clustered with RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, suggesting that the latter virus has experienced recombination in this gene.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !m self assert = In phylogeny of the RBD, SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related to pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in more divergent positions, again indicative of recombination. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is often used in the phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses, revealed that RmYN02, RaTG13, and SARSCoV-2 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses.

  / June, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !n self assert = We confirmed the bat host of RmYN02, Rhinolophus malayanus, by analyzing the sequence of the cytochrome b(Cytb) gene from the NGS data; this revealed 100% sequence identity to a Rhinolophus malayanus isolate (GenBank: MK900703). Both Rhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely distributed in southwest China and southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highly gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate the exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. Notably, RaTG13 was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, but feasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can utilize cave environments.



# LINK IT WITH THIS PAPER: Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19, ACE inhibitors are extremely protective on vascular dysfunction. “Most of their benefit in the continuum of cardiovascular illness — be it high blood pressure, be it stroke, be it heart attack, be it arrhythmia, be it heart failure — in any situation the mechanism by which they protect the cardiovascular system starts with their ability to stabilize the endothelial cells. Existing drugs that can help protect against endothelial cell damage- Statins and ACE inhibitors were linked to higher rates of survival. Statins reduce the risk of heart attacks not only by lowering cholesterol or preventing plaque, they also stabilize existing plaque, meaning they’re less likely to rupture if someone is on the drugs.

  head = In this multinational observational study involving patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias) is independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. It is important to note that we were not able to confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital mortality in this clinical context. Our investigation also confirms previous reports of the independent relationship of older age, current smoking, and COPD with death in Covid-19. Our results also suggest that women are proportionately more likely than men to survive the infection. Neither harmful nor beneficial associations were noted for antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, or hypoglycemic therapy.

  >>> Background
    Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.

  >>> Methods
    Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.

  >>> Results
    Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those ≤65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).

  >>> Conclusions
    Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

With respect to cardiovascular risk factors, 30.5% of the patients had hyperlipidemia, 26.3% had hypertension, 14.3% had diabetes mellitus, 16.8% were former smokers, and 5.5% were current smokers. Preexisting cardiovascular disease in this sample included coronary artery disease (present in 11.3% of the patients), a history of congestive heart failure (2.1%), and a history of cardiac arrhythmia (3.4%).

Patients who died were also more likely to have had COPD and a history of current smoking. Among medications, ACE inhibitors and statins were more commonly used by survivors than by nonsurvivors, whereas no association between survival and the use of ARBs was found.

The analyses according to continent and according to the income category of the country (high or low–middle) were consistent with the overall results.

  / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !j self assert = In our analyses, use of either ACE inhibitors or statins was associated with better survival among patients with Covid-19. However, these associations should be considered with extreme caution. Because our study was not a randomized, controlled trial, we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding. These data also offer no information concerning the potential effect of initiation of ACE inhibitor or statin therapy in patients with Covid-19 who do not have an appropriate indication for these medications. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of ACE inhibitors and statins will be necessary before any conclusion can be reached regarding a potential benefit of these agents in patients with Covid-19.

  head = Our findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement (as noted with presence of viral bodies) and of the host inflammatory response. In addition, induction of apoptosis and pyroptosis might have an important role in endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-endotheliitis could explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their clinical sequelae in patients with COVID-19.

The patients condition deteriorated following COVID-19 diagnosis, and he required mechanical ventilation. Multisystem organ failure occurred, and the patient died on day 8. Post-mortem analysis of the transplanted kidney by electron microscopy revealed viral inclusion structures in endothelial cells. In histological analyses, we found an accumulation of inflammatory cells associated with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies, in the heart, the small bowel and lung.

Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis.

  >>> Abstract
    The severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) largely depends on a patient’s age. Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients’ ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.

  let !a self assert = The aging immune system: An abundance of recent data describing the pathology and molecular changes in COVID-19 patients points to both immunosenescence and inflammaging as major drivers of the high mortality rates in older patients. Within immunosenescence, there are defects in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Innate immunosenescence is characterized by ineffective pathogen recognition and macrophage activation, and a reduction in natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, whereas adaptive immunosenescence is characterized by thymic atrophy and accumulation of anergic memory lymphocytes. In both cases, these age-related changes are thought to be due to pathogenic, genetic, and lifestyle factors that affect the cells’ epigenetic status and the diversity of immune cells.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !b self assert = The aging innate immune system: The inability of Alveolar macrophages (AMs) in older individuals to recognize viral particles and convert to a pro-inflammatory state likely accelerates COVID-19 in its early stages, whereas in its advanced stages, AMs are likely to be responsible for the excessive lung damage. A recent study comparing immune cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients showed in severe cases, macrophages were phenotypically more proinflammatory, expressing higher levels of CCR1 and CXCR2 that recruit other innate immune cells, compared to macrophages from moderate COVID-19 cases that expressed more T-cell attracting chemokines. Prolonged monocyte activation is a well-known cause of severe lung injury in rhesus monkeys and in cases of SARS (caused by SARS-CoV-1), higher numbers of pulmonary neutrophils and macrophages correlated with the development of ARDS and greater lung damage.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !c self assert =  A decline in neutrophil activity might also be partly responsible because, during aging, these cells progressively lose their ability to migrate to sites of infection and kill infected cells. NK cells, a major component in innate immunity with potent cytotoxic activity, are an unlikely cause of COVID-19 severity. Their numbers are relatively stable during aging and in a mouse model of SARS, they were not necessary for normal viral clearance. To discern which of these cell types play the most destructive roles, more detailed analyses of COVID-19 patient autopsy tissue will be needed.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !d self assert = Additionally, the production and diversity of mucins, protective glycoproteins found in mucosal barriers throughout the body, also change in aging, although their role in immunity against coronaviruses in humans is understudied.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !e self assert = The aging adaptive immune system: Immunosenescence of the adaptive immune system is also a likely factor that determines whether a patient progresses to severe COVID-19. Situated just above the heart, the thymus – a primary lymphoid organ and the site of T cell development and maturation of early thymic progenitors from the bone marrow – is one of the first tissues to experience aging. By age 65, the thymus is on average ~40% its original size [34], coincident with activation of the inflammasome component NLRP3 and Caspase-1, a pro-apoptotic protease [35, 36]. A build-up of intrathymic adipocytes further reduces thymic cellularity and deteriorates the thymic microenvironment. Thymic atrophy also contributes to a reduction of naïve T cells and an accumulation of memory lymphocytes, resulting in defective immunosurveillance and an exhaustion of B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !f self assert = Other common effects of aging on the adaptive immune system include a decline in the production of fresh naïve T cells, a less expansive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, T cell metabolic dysfunction, and weaker activation of T cells [38, 39]. Clonal populations of CD8+ T cells expand during aging, limiting their diversity, whereas CD4+ T cells retain fairly diverse TCRs [40] and, instead, suffer activation deficits [39].

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !g self assert = Interestingly, one study found that supercentenarians – defined as adults over 110 years old – tend to have an unusual population of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells whose activation doesn’t decline with age and can take on the effector functions usually performed by CD8+ T cells [41]. This T cell behavior may explain why some older people, even some people over 100, are able to survive COVID-19. Measuring the repertoire and frequency of TCRs in patients from a spectrum of ages and disease severity should be performed to determine if a loss of T cell diversity is a reason why SARS-CoV-2 viral loads tend to spike in older people but not the young.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !h self assert = Not only does the repertoire of T cells decline in aging, so do their numbers. Those over 60 years old increasingly have low T cell numbers, a condition known as lymphopenia [42]. Because T cells express very low levels of ACE2, the lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients is unlikely to be caused by direct SARS-CoV-2 infection

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !i self assert = One proposed cause of the T cell paucity is an exhaustion of the immune system driven by repeated exposures to viruses over one’s lifetime [42, 44, 45]. This hypothesis is based on several studies that tracked the morbidity and mortality of people over 60 who had been chronically infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [46, 47]. Cycles of CMV reemergence were associated with vast immune system remodeling, including a pronounced exhaustion of CD8+ T cells that was more predictive of all-cause mortality than chronological age.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !j self assert = Other studies indicate that T cell depletion is due to the cumulative exposure to many different pathogens and lifestyle factors, not CMV alone [46, 48]. At the chromosomal level, a major cause of immune exhaustion is telomere shortening in viral-specific memory CD8+ T cells, which induces cellular senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest and hyper-inflammation that prevents expansion upon re-infection [49]. The fact that in the most severe COVID-19 cases bronchoalveolar CD8+ T cells appear to have reduced expansion capability [25] and peripheral blood T cells express high levels of the immune-exhaustion marker PD-1 [42] make this theory plausible.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !k self assert = B cells – adaptive immune cells which produce antibodies in response to coronavirus antigens [21] – are also less diverse and less responsive in aging [50, 51]. While total B cells numbers do not decrease in aging, memory B cells accumulate and naïve B cells are depleted, which may lead to loss of diversity of the B cell repertoire, although this has not yet been definitively demonstrated in humans [51].

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !l self assert = Changes in IgG glycosylation patterns, however, have been shown to strongly associate with age and inflammation, and predict age-associated disease development [52]. In particular, IgG N-glycans appear to be the most predictive of biological aging, however B-cell intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of glycosylation in aging require further study.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !m self assert = Due to a lack of sun exposure and decreased production of vitamin D, about half of all older people have a deficiency in this vitamin [53], which reduces the efficacy of both adaptive and innate immune responses and increases the risk of infection [54]. Vitamin D levels in older people are correlated with preserved features of immunity such as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after stimulus. A recent meta-analysis of 25 randomized, placebo-controlled trials concluded that vitamin D supplementation prevented about 20% of acute respiratory infections [59]. As such, some health professionals have recommended vitamin D supplementation for older people in general and especially for aged-care residents and critically ill patients as a strategy for improving chances of COVID-19 survival.

  let !n self assert = Increased inflammation and cytokine storms in the aged: The cytokine profiles of late-stage COVID-19 patients are similar to patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, a type of cytokine storm that can be triggered by systemic viral infection, including increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, C-reactive protein (CRP), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP1-α) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !o self assert = Even more predictive of death than serum cytokine profiles is an increase in the fibrin degradation product D-dimer, released from blood clots in the microvasculature, and a prognostic for DIC [9]. As such, D-dimer is now widely regarded as a key indicator of the severity of late-stage COVID-19. D-dimer levels naturally increase with age, most likely reflecting a higher basal level of vascular inflammation [65], which could predispose patients to severe COVID-19. It would, therefore, be informative to know if pre-cytokine storm levels of D-dimer levels could predict who is likely to develop a cytokine storm

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !p self assert = In cytokine storms, high levels of IL-6 cause vascular endothelial cells to secrete fibrin, which causes DIC. In the lung, this may underlie the hypoxemia seen in patients with seemingly functional lungs. If left untreated, clots leach additional clotting factors from the bloodstream, increasing the risk of bleeding (coagulopathy) and multi-organ failure. Drugs such as tocilizumab (Actemra), which block IL-6 receptor activity, are currently being used in patients in advanced stages

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !q self assert = One in two fatal cases of COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm, 82% of whom are over the age of 60 [67]. Though there may be many simultaneous triggers of the storm, abundant evidence indicates that inflammaging is a major driver, exacerbated by obesity, poor diets and oral health, microbial dysbiosis, and sedentary lifestyles

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !r self assert = A central player that could help explain the predisposition to cytokine storms is NLRP3, the major protein component of the inflammasome. During aging, there is a steady increase in the abundance and activity of NLRP3 in immune cells, including AMs of the lung which, upon chronic stimulation, contribute to pulmonary fibrosis.n older individuals, NLRP3 may be poised for hyperactivation by SARS-CoV-2 antigens. NLRP3 activity is under the direct control of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a member of the NAD+-dependent sirtuin family of deacetylases (SIRT1-7) [75]. During aging, NAD+ levels decline, reducing the activity of the sirtuins [76]. Old mice, especially those deficient in SIRT2, have decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance [77]. This decline, exacerbated by COVID-19, might promote hyperactivation of NLRP3 and the trigger cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !s self assert = Maintaining NAD+ levels may therefore alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, a possibility supported by recent data showing that SARS-CoV-2 proteins hyperactivate poly-ADP-ribose polymerases PARP9, -10, -12, and -14 and deplete cellular NAD+ [78]. Additionally, NAD+ precursors lower inflammation in human subjects

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !t self assert = Mechanisms of infection in other coronaviruses support the hypothesis that NLRP3 activation is a trigger of cytokine storms in the aged. The SARS-CoV-1 ORF3a protein, for example, is a potent activator of pro-IL-1β gene transcription and protein maturation, the two main signals required for activation of NLRP3 [81]. In macrophages, SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 in cytosolic dot-like structures [82], suggesting another two-step model, in which inflammaging and the NLRP3 basal overactivation is the first step and SARS-CoV-2 antigen-mediated hyperactivation is the second step that triggers a cytokine storm.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !u self assert = Indeed, in older adults, the upregulation of two inflammasome-related gene sets correlate with increased risk of hypertension, metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress and mortality [84]. Individuals over the age of 85 that expressed lower levels of these inflammasome modules were less likely to die within seven years [84]. Taking together, the known effects of coronavirus proteins on NAD+, NLRP3, and the two stages of inflammasome activation, these data provide a plausible explanation as to why co-morbidities positively correlate with cytokine storms and fatality in COVID-19 patients.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !v self assert = After age and hematological cancers, obesity is the next major risk factor for COVID-19 fatality, similar to type 2 diabetes [85]. Obesity is well known to increase the activity of NLRP3 and stimulate low grade inflammation in mice, including higher levels of serum chemokines, and lower neutralizing antibodies and effector memory T cells during a viral infection [86]. Accordingly, this may help explain why obesity is associated with lower survival in COVID-19, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections, and why obesity-related human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes, predispose patients to cytokine storms (Table 1) [87–89]. In addition, by causing the endothelium of the microvasculature to become leaky, obesity and type 2 diabetes, may increase the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect surrounding pericytes that appear to express ACE2 at levels far greater than surrounding cells [12].

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !w self assert = Biological clocks: Over the past decade, a variety of biological clocks have been developed to predict human health and longevity more accurately than chronological age, including those based on DNA methylation patterns [134–136], inflammaging [137], gene expression patterns [138], frailty [139, 140], serum proteins [141], and IgG glycosylation [142–144]. Given that these clocks provide a quantitative measure of the rate of aging of an individual and their overall resilience, biological clocks may be useful for identifying at-risk populations and for predicting, within those populations, who will most likely progress to severe COVID-19.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !x self assert = Glycosylation clocks: Changes in glycosylation during aging may also predispose older individuals to severe COVID-19 [148]. Glycosylation is the enzymatic process by which carbohydrates called glycans, such as sialic acid, mannose and fucose, are covalently attached to proteins or lipids, typically on the cell surface or in the bloodstream. An individuals repertoire of glycans – a notable example being the type of N-glycans attached to immunoglobulins  – changes with age and environmental factors, such as smoking and poor diet. The type of glycans attached to IgGs affects their pro- and anti-inflammatory properties.

  / May, 2020 - Aging
  let !y self assert = Decreased galactosylation of IgGs is associated with central adiposity  and inflammaging in the context of diabetes. Biological clocks based on IgG glycosylation are able to predict chronological age within 10 years, and can be improved by inclusion of clinical parameters. Thus, changes to the glycome with age could serve both as an indicator of biological age and could potentially predict COVID-19 severity.

// Changes in contact patterns shape the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China
doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb8001
ref 'Zhang_et_al_04_29_2020
  head = Daily contacts were reduced 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults 15-64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95%CI 0.24-0.49), while in contrast, individuals over 65 years are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95%CI: 1.12-1.92). Based on these data, we build a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.

  >>> Abstract
    Intense non-pharmaceutical interventions were put in place in China to stop transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults 15-64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95%CI 0.24-0.49), while in contrast, individuals over 65 years are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95%CI: 1.12-1.92). Based on these data, we build a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !a self assert = We analyzed a total of 1,245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in Wuhan, and 1,296 contacts reported by 557 participants in Shanghai. In Wuhan, the average daily number of contacts per participant was significantly reduced from 14.6 for the baseline period (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 14.0) to 2.0 for the outbreak period (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 1.9) (p<0.001). The reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex, age group, type of profession, and household size (Table 1). A larger reduction was observed in Shanghai, where the average daily number of contacts declined from 18.8 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 19.8) to 2.3 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 2.1). Although an average individual in Shanghai reported more contacts than one in Wuhan on a regular weekday, this difference essentially disappeared during the COVID-19 outbreak period.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !b self assert =  Overall, contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members (94.1% in Wuhan and 78.5% in Shanghai). These findings are consistent with trends in within-city mobility data, which indicate an 86.9% drop in Wuhan and 74.5% in Shanghai between early January and early February. Such a large decrease in internal mobility is consistent with most of contacts occurring in the household during the outbreak period. Of note, the strict social distancing measures implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai did not entirely zero out contacts in the workplace, as essential workers continued to perform their activities.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !c self assert = We found that susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection increased with age. Young individuals (aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual aged 15-64 years [OR=0.34 (95%CI: 0.24-0.49), p-value<0.0001]. In contrast, older individuals aged 65 years and over had a higher risk of infection than adults 15-64 years [OR=1.47 (95%CI: 1.12-1.92), p-value=0.005]. These findings are in contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !d self assert = In the early phases of COVID-19 spread in Wuhan, before interventions were put in place, R0 values were estimated to range between 2.0 and 3.5 (12–18). In this analysis, we extended this range from 1 to 4 for the baseline period (i.e., before interventions). We find that the considerable changes of mixing patterns observed in Wuhan and Shanghai during the social distancing period led to a drastic decrease in R0. This finding is robust to relaxing assumptions about age differences in susceptibility to infection; the epidemic is still well controlled if SARS-CoV-2 infection is assumed to be equally likely in all age groups. We also performed sensitivity analyses regarding possible recall and compliance biases of self-reported contacts as well as the definition of contact (i.e., considering only contacts lasting more than 5 min). The results are consistent with those reported here.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !e self assert = In an uncontrolled epidemic (without intervention measures, travel restrictions, or spontaneous behavioral responses of the population), and for R0 in the range 2-3, we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 53%-92% after a year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, with slight variation between Wuhan and Shanghai. These estimates should be considered as an upper bound of the infection attack rate as they are based on a compartmental model that does not account for high clustering of contacts (e.g., repeated contacts among household members).

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !f self assert = If we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on, as the new virus emerges, the estimated R0 remains under the epidemic threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location. Furthermore, we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai would have been enough to block transmission for an R0 before the interventions up to ~6 in Wuhan and ~7.8 in Shanghai.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !g self assert = Our modeling approach indicates that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline R0 up to 1.5. Removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline R0 up to 1.2. If we apply these interventions to a COVID-19 scenario, assuming a baseline R0 of 2 - 3.5, we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence, and a delay in the epidemic, but transmission is not interrupted. For instance, for baseline R0=2.5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the mean peak daily incidence is reduced by about 64%. In the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed, we estimate a reduction of about 42%.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !h self assert = Overall, school-based closure policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a COVID-19 outbreak, but they can impact disease dynamics, and hence hospital surge capacity. It is important to stress that individuals aged 5-19 years in Shanghai represent 9.5% of the population (19), markedly lower than the mean in China [16.8% (19)] and other countries [including Western countries; e.g., 19.7% in the US

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !i self assert = In our simulation model, we estimated the effect of social distancing alone; combining social distancing with other interventions would have a synergistic effect to even further reduce transmission. It is likely that population wide social distancing, case-based strategies, and decontamination efforts, all contributed to achieve control in Wuhan and Shanghai, and their effect is difficult to separate out in retrospective observational studies.

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !j self assert = Modeling results may underestimate the effect of social distancing interventions as our results concentrate on number of contacts and ignore the type of social interactions (e.g., increased distance between individuals while in contact, or use of face mask), which may have changed due increased awareness of the population. Finally, it is worth noting that our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy, which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of different durations of intervention

  / April, 2020 - Science
  let !k self assert = Our study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in Wuhan and Shanghai, and the resulting changes in human behavior, drastically decreased daily contacts, essentially reducing them to household interactions. This leads to a dramatic reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As lockdown measures are put in place in other locations, human mixing patterns in the outbreak period could be captured by data on within-household contacts, which are available for several countries around the world. Moving forward, it will be particularly important to design targeted strategies for long-term control of COVID-19, including school- and work-based control strategies, along with large scale testing and contact tracing. Research should concentrate on refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection, disease, and infectiousness, which are instrumental to evaluating the impact of these strategies.

  head = We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77. Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate. In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation. Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures. ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. While in those cells lacking NLRP3 accumulating ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-independent cell death.

  >>> Abstract
    The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak was caused by a coronavirus (CoV) named the SARS-CoV. SARS pathology is propagated both by direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and aberrant activation of the innate immune response. Here, we identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets the innate immune response. We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77. Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate. In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation. Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures. ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages.

  let !a self assert = Though the exact mechanistic role of ORF8b in SARS-CoV pathogenesis remains unclear, it is well established that the splitting of ORF8 corresponds with the shift from the early to the middle stage of the SARS epidemic, with the majority of affected patients being infected by virus containing the split ORF. Recent advances in mouse models have shown that SARS pathogenesis is driven by high initial virus titers resulting from a late interferon response, which drives aberrant recruitment of IMMs and activation of the innate immune response resulting in cytotoxicity. Given the likelihood that ORF8b is evolutionarily adaptive for the virus, it follows that ORF8b may contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis by impairing the host interferon response and/or targeting the innate immune system.

  / June, 2019 - Cell Death Discovery
  let !b self assert = In our study, ORF8b appears to be degraded by the autophagy–lysosome system, as treatment with bafilomycin A1 increases ORF8b levels. The aggregation ability of ORF8b may be protective against degradation, as we consistently observed that the anti-aggregation V77K mutant is expressed at lower levels than ORF8b.

  let !c self assert = It has previously been reported that ORF8ab and ORF8b induce ER stress40, which is consistent with our findings showing accumulation of CHOP by ORF8b expression dependent on V77.

  let !d self assert = We also find induction of lysosomal stress and activation of TFEB by ORF8b. Both ER stress and TFEB have been shown to propagate the inflammatory response, with TFEB directly promoting the transcription of inflammatory cytokines26,41,42. This may be a cellular mechanism by which ORF8b activates the innate immune response in macrophages and contributes to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.

  / June, 2019 - Cell Death Discovery
  let !e self assert =  Our findings indicate the SARS-CoV can activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via ORF8b. While SARS-CoV abortively infects macrophages/monocytes, enough ORF8b may be present to impact lysosome integrity, autophagy pathways, and NLRP3 inflammasomes. In contrast to macrophages, the SARS-CoV productively replicates in lung epithelial cells. These cells also express NLRP3 and can assemble NLRP3 inflammasomes.

  let !f self assert = In humans infected with the SARS-CoV the full impact of ORF-8b on the pathways we delineated in this study are likely in the lung epithelium.

Moving forward, live virus deletion studies are required to assess the effects of ORF8b mediated intracellular aggregates and ORF8b mediated NLRP3 activation.



# seropervalence data, second wave
// Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong and in residents evacuated from Hubei province, China: a multicohort study
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30053-7
ref 'Wang-To_et_al_06_03_2020
  head = Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis. Furthermore, the higher amount of possible disease-enhancing cross-reactive antibody in adults than in children, as evident by the OD value of the enzyme immunoassay, should be explored further as a possible explanation of more severe disease in adults.

  >>> Background
    The role of subclinical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in perpetuating the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown because population seroprevalence data are absent. We aimed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay, and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong before and after the pandemic, as well as in Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China.

  >>> Methods
    We did a multicohort study in a hospital and university in Hong Kong. We evaluated the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with RT-PCR data from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with archived serum samples collected before 2019. We compared the seropositivity of the general population of Hong Kong before and after the pandemic had begun, and determined the seropositivity of Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China, in March, 2020.

  >>> Findings
    Between Feb 26 and March 18, 2020, we assessed RT-PCR samples from 45 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 to establish the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. To establish the specificity of these assays, we retrieved archived serum. The sensitivity was 91·1% (41 of 45 [95% CI 78·8–97·5]) for the microneutralisation assay, 57·8% (26 of 45 [42·2–72·3]) for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 66·7% (30 of 45 [51·1–80·0]) for anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and 73·3% (33 of 45 [58·1–85·4]) for enzyme immunoassay (either positive for anti-nucleoprotein or anti-RBD IgG). The specificity was 100% (152 of 152 [95% CI 97·6–100·0]) for both the enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. Among the Hong Kong general population, 53 (2·7%) of 1938 were enzyme immunoassay positive, but of those who were positive, all 53 were microneutralisation negative, and no significant increase was seen in the seroprevalence between April 12, 2018, and Feb 13, 2020. Among asymptomatic Hubei returnees, 17 (4%) of 452 were seropositive with the enzyme immunoassay or the microneutralisation assay, with 15 (88%) of 17 seropositive with the microneutralisation assay, and two familial clusters were identified.

  >>> Interpretation
    Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis. The role of age-related cross reactive non-neutralising antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 warrants further investigation.

  >>> Setting
    Union Hospital in Wuhan, China.

  >>> Participants
    453 patients were admitted to the hospital with laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐Cov‐2 infection from January 22, 2020 to March 17, 2020.

  >>> Main Outcomes and Measures
    Patients were classified into four categories: normal glucose, hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7–6.4%), newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%), and known diabetes. The major outcomes included in‐hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

  >>> Results
    Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest percentage to be admitted to the ICU (11.7%) and require IMV (11.7%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1%; 9.2%) and patients with hyperglycemia (6.2%; 4.7%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5%; 2.3%), respectively. The multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios of mortality among COVID‐19 patients with normal glucose, hyperglycemia, newly diagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes were 1.00, 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–16.6), 9.42 (95% CI 2.18–40.7), and 4.63 (95% CI 1.02–21.0), respectively.

  >>> Conclusion
    We firstly showed that COVID‐19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest risk of all‐cause mortality compared with COVID‐19 patients with known diabetes, hyperglycemia and normal glucose. Patients with COVID‐19 need to be under surveillance for blood glucose screening.

  let !a self assert = Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest percentage to be admitted to the ICU (11.7%) and require IMV (11.7%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1%; 9.2%) and patients with hyperglycemia (6.2%; 4.7%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5%; 2.3%), respectively.

  / May, 2020 - Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism
  let !b self assert = The multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratio of mortality among COVID‐19 patients with normal glucose was 1.00. Relative to normal glucose, all-cause mortality increased in hyperglycemia (HR 3.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-16.6), newly diagnosed diabetes (HR 9.42; 95% CI 2.18-40.7), and known diabetes (HR 4.63; 95% CI 1.02-21.0), after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. After further adjustment for using antihypertensive drugs, using lipid-lowering agents, admission to ICU, and using IMV, these associations did not change; however HR of mortality for known  diabetes became  higher than that for newly diagnosed diabetes after additional adjustment for using glucose-lowering drugs before hospital admission and  during hospitalization, and using corticosteroid.

  / May, 2020 - Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism
  let !c self assert = Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest and patients with known diabetes had higher mean values of CRP, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen,  lactate dehydrogenase,  blood urea nitrogen  and fasting glucose than patients with either normal glucose or hyperglycemia.

  / May, 2020 - Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism
  let !d self assert = Patients with known diabetes and  newly diagnosed diabetes had higher COVID-related complications including ARDS (3.1-10.5% vs 0.8-3.1%), acute kidney injury (15.3-17.0% vs 1.5-3.1%), shock (11.2-23.4% vs 2.3-4.7%), and hypoalbuminemia (36.7-39.4% vs 10.8-19.4%), as well as higher severe or critical types of COVID-19 (82.7-89.4% vs 61.4-72.1%) compared with patients with normal glucose or hyperglycemia.

  / May, 2020 - Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism
  let !e self assert = Patients with known diabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes were more likely to use antihypertensive drugs, glucose-lowering medicines during hospital admission, lipid-lowering agents, corticosteroid treatment, oxygen support, and stay longer at hospital compared with patients with normal glucose or slight hyperglycemia.

  / May, 2020 - Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism
  let !f self assert = When fasting glucose was considered as a continuous variable by using restricted cubic splines, a graded positive association of fasting glucose with all-cause mortality was observed among COVID-19 patients after excluding known diabetes.

  / May, 2020 - Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism
  let !g self assert = To assess the potential hyperglycemia to exposed COVID-19, we performed one sensitivity analysis among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes based on the first laboratory measurement of fasting glucose and HbA1c after hospital admission. Multivariable-adjusted HRs of mortality were 3.30 (95% CI 0.65-16.6) among patients with hyperglycemia, 9.06 (95% CI 1.88-43.6) among patients with fasting glucose >7 mmol/L but no HbA1c measurements, 10.4 (95% CI 1.97-54.7) among patients with fasting glucose >7 mmol/L and HbA1c <6.5%, 9.23 (95% CI 1.87-45.5) among patients with fasting glucose >7 mmol/L and HbA1c >6.5%, and 4.62 (95% CI 1.02-20.9) among patients with known diabetes, compared with patients with normal glucose.

  let !a self assert = TYPES OF TESTS: COVID-19 tests can be grouped as nucleic acid, serological, antigen, and ancillary tests, all of which play distinct roles in hospital, point-of-care, or large-scale population testing.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !b self assert = In NATs, viral RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA, which is then amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). NATs are the most widely used tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and are increasingly run on automated platforms that take several hours to complete. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended distinct SARS-CoV-2–specific RNA regions for testing (viral nucleocapsid N1, N2, and human RNase P gene), primers, and reagents. This assay differs from the World Health Organization (WHO) assay, which targets the CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and envelope (E) genes.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !c self assert = Serological tests rely on affinity ligands to assess host response proteins [host immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, interleukins, and other host components]. Most IgG/IgM serum tests use recombinant viral proteins or peptides harvested from Escherichia coli or human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells as capture reagents for human IgG/IgM. These tests need to accurately distinguish past infections due to SARS-CoV-2 from those caused by other human coronaviruses. The uses of serological testing include determination of previous viral exposure in the population for retrospective assessment of the efficacy of control measures, assessment of immune status for individuals, and determination of surrogates of immunity for vaccine development. Each of these uses places different constraints on diagnostics.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !d self assert = Most antigen tests probe for the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 via lateral flow or ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests. These tests can be performed using nasopharyngeal swabs and take less than an hour to complete. Ancillary tests comprise a broad category of personal devices (apps and wearable sensors) and hospital laboratory tests, including blood gas analysis, coagulation tests, and indicators of cytokine storm (7) such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), ferritin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein–1α (MIP-1α), and tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α). These tests aid in the management of patients with COVID-19.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !e self assert = CROSS-REACTIVITY, CROSS-IMMUNITY, ACCURACY, AND TURNAROUND TIME OF TESTS: Cross-reactivity in diagnostic tests has been observed. For example, an immunogenic domain in the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, and murine monoclonal antibodies raised against the SARS-CoV-1 immunogenic domain recognized the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Defining whether humans can naturally develop cross-immunity requires investigation. At present, studies using sera from individuals who have recovered from SARS or COVID-19 infections have shown limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection does not protect against the other.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !f self assert = The accuracy of a diagnostic test is commonly defined by its sensitivity (positive test in a patient with disease), specificity (negative test in a healthy individual), negative predictive value (chance that a person with a negative test is truly disease-free), and positive predictive value (chance that a person with a positive test is truly diseased). NATs typically have high analytical sensitivities and specificities under ideal circumstances. However, in clinical reality, the test sensitivity varies according to duration of illness, the specific clinical COVID-19 syndrome, the site of specimen collection, the quality of specimen collection, and the viral load. As a result, false-negative rates have been reported to occur in ~30% of patients with COVID-19 [range, 10 to 40%.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !g self assert =  If there is a high pretest probability in patients with symptoms or findings (suggestive computed tomography scans or chest x-rays), testing should be repeated after a single negative result. By contrast, concerns about “missing cases” that are infectious in the community because of imperfect sensitivity are outweighed by the current lack of access to testing.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !h self assert = The accuracy of serological tests can be near 100% when samples are acquired 20 days after infection or first symptoms. At earlier time points, the sensitivity and specificity are lower as the immune response is evolving.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !i self assert = Inaccurate serological tests may lead to two major problems: the false labeling of patients who have been infected as disease-negative, and the false labeling of patients who have not been infected as disease-positive. Both errors will affect control efforts in important ways and have consequences for individuals tested.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !j self assert = The time from sample acquisition to NAT result can vary from less than an hour to several days. Factors that determine this time include the testing platform as well as the logistics of sample acquisition, transport, processing, and reporting. NATs based on conventional PCR typically require 4 to 6 hours of processing, including sample preparation, RNA extraction, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and readout of amplified DNA products.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !k self assert = Point-of-care PCR kits can shorten the time to result to about 30 min (19) and can be occasionally faster (20). This is accomplished using cartridges or lateral flow technology for sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification, and detection. However, these rapid tests typically have lower throughput, are not yet automated, and are generally more expensive than other tests. In modern healthcare systems, there are different needs and requirements for different types of assays, for example, for screening large populations versus making rapid clinical decisions.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !l self assert = UNDERSTANDING VIRAL LOAD AND IMMUNITY: SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers innate and adaptive immune responses, which can be detected in peripheral blood. Extensive efforts are under way to characterize these immune responses longitudinally in patients with diverse clinical outcomes. Results from these studies should help explain how the body controls the infection and why it sometimes fails to do so. Among adaptive immune cells, B cells are of interest because some of them may produce IgM or IgG antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 antigens. In this context, a positive titer refers to the detection of SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies in a patient’s serum sample.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !m self assert = Seroconversion (the body’s process of developing antibodies) may occur around 1 to 2 weeks after infection and is thought to provide some immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in people who recover from the disease. Evidence from other coronaviruses suggests that protection may last for 1 to 2 years; however, at this time, the duration and nature of immunity generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown, and there is no evidence that COVID-19 antibody–positive patients who have recovered from the disease are protected from a second infection. It is thus advisable that such patients continue wearing personal protective equipment and practicing social distancing and frequent hand washing.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !n self assert = A complete infectious virus particle consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a capsid. NATs detect viral RNA that may not necessarily come from replicating viruses. Few studies have published the relationship between cultivatable virus and RNA shedding, and it seems that a large subset of convalescing people who shed RNA may not be infectious. These findings require confirmation. The only current test to unequivocally assess the presence of infectious viral particles is viral culture in cells. Host cells that support growth of SARS-CoV-2 include African green monkey kidney Vero C1008 clone E6 cells (ATCC-CRL-1586).

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !o self assert = In addition to antibodies, quantifying the abundance of virus within an infected individual may help inform treatment or outcomes. Viral load (also referred to as viral burden or titer) is a numerical expression of the quantity of virus in a given volume (the number of infectious particles per milliliter). Clinical observations suggest that the initial viral load in an individual is related to the severity of COVID-19 disease. The current evidence of this relationship, however, remains limited by the suboptimal quality of many of the studies, their retrospective nature, small sample sizes, and the potential for selection bias.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !p self assert = Another possible source of error is the type of NAT used. At high viral loads, both RT-PCR and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) show consistent results, whereas for low viral load samples, ddPCR was shown to be more accurate due to its higher sensitivity; however, this requires confirmation.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !q self assert = Also, patients of different ages, including children, may have similar viral loads, raising the possibility that children may be infectious despite typically showing less severe symptoms than adults.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !r self assert = In patients with COVID-19, positive test results determined by NATs have been reported as follows: bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 93%; bronchoscopy biopsy, 46%; sputum, 72%; nasal swabs, 63%; pharyngeal swab, 32%; feces, 29%; blood, 1%; and urine, 0%. These numbers vary in other cohorts and depend on the severity of the disease. The viability and infectiousness of the virus in these samples warrant further investigation.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !s self assert = TESTING COSTS AND PRIORITIZATION: A new law mandates that Medicare, Medicaid, other government health care and insurance plans, and most private plans cover COVID-19 testing in the United States without copays or deductibles. On 5 March 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for health care providers and laboratories to test patients for SARS-CoV-2. Starting in April, laboratories performing the test could bill Medicare and other health insurers for services, using a newly created HCPCS code (U0001). This code applies to all tests that were developed by the CDC.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !t self assert = Laboratories performing non-CDC laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 can bill for them using a different HCPCS code (U0002). Current test prices are $35.91 for U0001 and $51.31 for U0002. The overall costs should take into context how a diagnostic test is used in practice. For example, if a test is restricted to very sick patients, the cost is small compared to the overall medical care. Conversely, if a test is used for broad screening, the cost per positive result could be high depending on prevalence.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !u self assert = There are different indications for diagnostic testing for individuals with a proven or suspected case of COVID-19. Given the limited testing capacity in the United States, priority lists have been established. Priority 1 includes hospitalized patients and symptomatic health care workers. Priority 2 includes symptomatic patients in health care facilities, >65-year-old patients with underlying conditions, and first responders. Priority 3 includes symptomatic patients, including critical infrastructure workers. Individuals without symptoms are currently not prioritized for any testing

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !v self assert = When carried out broadly and repeatedly, NAT results have consequences for individuals, communities, and the entire population. These tests not only permit the identification, isolation, and treatment of infected individuals but also diagnose presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers and thus more accurately define the infection rates across populations. Serological testing should be used in parallel with NATs to determine which individuals have acquired immunity and how long it lasts. Serosurveys may also help efforts to develop vaccines. By extension, serological testing that is performed frequently and on a wide scale should help determine what fraction of the population may be immune to COVID-19 and which individuals may rejoin the workforce.

  / June, 2020 - Science Translational Medicine
  let !w self assert = Containing COVID-19 will likely require combinations and concomitant use of the different types of diagnostic tests discussed above. To be successful, these assays will need to be deployed in such a way that broad and repeated testing becomes routine.

// Effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and demand for hospital services in the UK: a modelling study
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30133-X
ref 'Davies_et_al_06_02_2020
  head = Using an age-structured transmission dynamic model, we explored different scenarios for COVID-19 transmission and control in the general population of the UK. We found that moderate interventions lasting for 12 weeks, such as school closures, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, or shielding of older people, would probably not have been sufficient to control the epidemic and to avoid far exceeding available ICU capacity, even when these measures were used in combination. In particular, school closures had little effect in our projections, despite our model accounting for substantial asymptomatic transmission among children However, we estimated that a scenario in which more intense lockdown measures were implemented for shorter periods, against a general background of physical distancing measures, might be able to keep projected case numbers at a level that would not overwhelm the health system.

  >>> Background
    Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK. Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been crucial to support evidence-based policy making during the early stages of the epidemic. This study assesses the potential impact of different control measures for mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the UK.

  >>> Methods
    We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, tracking 66·4 million people aggregated to 186 county-level administrative units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The four base interventions modelled were school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number, R0.

  >>> Findings
    We projected a median unmitigated burden of 23 million (95% prediction interval 13–30) clinical cases and 350 000 deaths (170 000–480 000) due to COVID-19 in the UK by December, 2021. We found that the four base interventions were each likely to decrease R0, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined intervention was more effective at reducing R0, but only lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R0 near or below 1; the most stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120 000 cases (46 000–700 000) and 50 000 deaths (9300–160 000). Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care demand exceeding availability.

  >>> Interpretation
    The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are probably required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.

  let !a self assert = We found that the four base interventions were each likely to decrease R0, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined intervention was more effective at reducing R0, but only lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R0 near or below 1

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !b self assert = The most stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120 000 cases (46 000–700 000) and 50 000 deaths (9300–160 000). Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care demand exceeding availability.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !c self assert = We projected that an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would result in a median 23 million (95% PI 13–30) clinical cases in the UK up to December, 2021. Under this scenario, 85% (95% PI 57–95) of the population would be infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 42% (32–51) of those infected showing clinical symptoms.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !d self assert = The unmitigated CFR was 1·5% (1·3–1·7) and the unmitigated infection-fatality ratio was 0·63% (0·45–0·79). In turn, this would result in a projected 350 000 deaths (170 000–480 000) directly attributable to COVID-19, without accounting for any potential increase in the CFR caused by exceeding hospital capacity.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !e self assert = The projected peak number of ICU beds required was 200 000 (61 000–370 000). This is roughly 13–80 times ICU capacity in the UK, which we tallied at 4562 beds in the absence of any efforts to further expand capacity.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !f self assert = When school closures, physical distancing, shielding of older people, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, and the combination intervention were timed to centre on the peak of the unmitigated epidemic, they each decreased the total number of cases by 20–30% and delayed the peak of the epidemic by 3–8 weeks on average.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !g self assert = While physical distancing was predicted to have the greatest impact on the total number of cases, shielding of older people was predicted to have the greatest impact on the number of deaths, because while shielding of older people had a smaller impact on overall transmission, it more effectively protected the highest-risk individuals from infection.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !h self assert = We found that, when implemented alone, none of these shorter-duration interventions were able to decrease health-care need to below available capacity. We estimated that neither school closures, physical distancing, shielding of older people, nor self-isolation alone would reduce R0 enough to bring about a sustained decline in the incidence of new infections. This combination strategy was projected to have a greater impact on R0, and in a small proportion (23 [12%] of 200) of simulations was sufficient to halt the epidemic altogether during the intervention period. However, lifting the interventions led to a rapid resurgence of cases in the model, even when R0 had been kept below 1 during the intervention period

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !i self assert = Examining the simulated dynamics at a county level shows that the timing of local epidemics can vary among counties, and highlights that epidemics at a local level are predicted to peak more sharply than they do across the entire UK

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !j self assert = When only a single, 12-week intervention is deployed, our projections also showed that instead of centring measures over the unmitigated peak of cases, it was preferable to trigger the intervention later to reduce the total health burden. This is because the introduction of control measures itself shifts the peak later in time—ie, by flattening the curve of the epidemic—and therefore the optimal timing of the intervention is also delayed. In particular, the most effective timing for introduction of measures could involve a delay of as much as 4 weeks. However, optimally timing an intervention could be more difficult in practice than these scenarios suggest, since here they are run with complete knowledge of when the simulated peak would occur in the absence of any intervention.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !k self assert = When varying adherence to interventions among counties, median outcomes were similar but less certain: where projections showed 14 million (95% PI 6·2–21) cases and 200 000 deaths (80 000–290 000) by December, 2021, without between-county variation, they showed 14 million (6·0–21) cases and 200 000 deaths (77 000–300 000) with county-level variation

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !l self assert = Although yearly attendance at sporting events is high (75·1 million spectators per year30), even if we assume that people make the equivalent of their mean daily physical contacts at such events (ie, five contacts per person, to make a total of 375 million), this number is very low relative to the number of yearly contacts that occur outside the context of sporting events (269 billion). A more general reduction in leisure contacts by 75% was estimated to have a more substantial impact on the epidemic, reducing cases by 1·9 million (0·37–4·6) up to Sept 1. In other words, while banning spectator sports might have decreased the total number of cases, we estimated that other potential policies relating to leisure activities would probably be more effective.

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !m self assert = Specifically, closing schools reduced deaths from 120 000 (95% PI 380–270 000) to 65 000 (150–260 000) and reduced peak ICU beds required from 53 000 (190–170 000) to 29 000 (580–140 000) up to July 20, but introducing one additional contact per weekday between children and older individuals for all children increased deaths to 79 000 (160–290 000) and increased peak ICU beds required to 35 000 (560–160 000) up to July 20

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !n self assert = When modelling the likely impact of the proposed intensive interventions strategy, we found implementation of these measures had the potential to delay the peak of the epidemic by 7 weeks (95% PI 1–49), from 12 weeks (9–20) to 19 weeks (10–69) after the start of community transmission, and to reduce the total number of deaths by half. Despite this substantial reduction in burden, the projections still showed a large number of cases (1·9–20 million), and a large number of ICU beds (8300–130 000) occupied during the peak of the epidemic. Indeed, we projected that ICU bed capacity could be exceeded by five times or more for several weeks. While we did not explicitly predict the impact of this on mortality rates, this would almost certainly lead to a substantially increased CFR.

  let !o self assert = We found that adding periods of lockdown to the intensive interventions scenario, to be triggered when ICU beds required for patients with COVID-19 exceeded a threshold of either 1000, 2000, or 5000 beds nationally, would still result in a high number of ICU beds being occupied, but at much lower levels than the scenario without lockdowns

  / June, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !p self assert = Lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R0 near or below 1, and hence to bring about a decrease in the incidence of new infections. We found that, depending on the threshold ICU bed occupancy at which lockdown periods were triggered, there was a tradeoff between having fewer, longer lockdown periods (lower threshold) and having more frequent, shorter lockdown periods (higher threshold), with the higher thresholds resulting in less time spent in lockdown overall but higher peak demands on ICU bed capacity. Lower thresholds also resulted in more individuals remaining susceptible at the end of the simulation period, potentially increasing the total duration for which recurrent lockdowns would need to be maintained.

  let !q self assert = The recurrent lockdown scenario with the most stringent triggering threshold of 1000 ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients reduced total COVID-19 deaths by 58% (95% PI 30–80) relative to the intensive interventions scenario, and by 86% (64–96) relative to the unmitigated epidemic.

// The ABO blood group locus and a chromosome 3 gene cluster associate with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure in an Italian-Spanish genome-wide association analysis
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.20114991
ref 'Ellinghaus_et_al_06_02_2020
  head = Using a pragmatic approach with simplified inclusion criteria and a complementary team of clinicians at the European Covid-19 epicenters in Italy and Spain and available German and Norwegian scientists, we were able to perform a complete GWAS for Covid-19 respiratory failure in about two months. We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 and rs657152 at 9q34, which were genome-wide significant (P<5×10-8) in the meta-analysis of both study panels. Our data aligns with the suggestions that blood group O is associated with lower risk compared with non-O blood groups whereas blood group A is associated with higher risk of acquiring Covid-19 compared with non-A blood groups.

  >>> Background
    Respiratory failure is a key feature of severe Covid-19 and a critical driver of mortality, but for reasons poorly defined affects less than 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

  >>> Methods
    We included 1,980 patients with Covid-19 respiratory failure at seven centers in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe (Milan, Monza, Madrid, San Sebastian and Barcelona) for a genome-wide association analysis. After quality control and exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1,255 population-derived controls from Italy, and 775 patients and 950 controls from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted a meta-analysis of both case-control panels.

  >>> Results
    We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 and rs657152 at 9q34, which were genome-wide significant (P<5x10-8) in the meta-analysis of both study panels, odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.14x10-10 and OR 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95x10-8), respectively. Among six genes at 3p21.31, SLC6A20 encodes a known interaction partner with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The association signal at 9q34 was located at the ABO blood group locus and a blood-group-specific analysis showed higher risk for A-positive individuals (OR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75, P=1.48x10-4) and a protective effect for blood group O (OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79, P=1.06x10-5).

  >>> Conclusions
    We herein report the first robust genetic susceptibility loci for the development of respiratory failure in Covid-19. Identified variants may help guide targeted exploration of severe Covid-19 pathophysiology.

  let !a self assert = We found two loci to be associated with Covid-19 induced respiratory failure with genomewide significance (P<5×10-8) in the meta-analysis, the rs11385942 insertion-deletion GA/A SNP at chromosome 3p21.31, ORmeta 1.77 (95% CI,1.48 to 2.11), P=1.14×10-10 and the rs657152 A/C SNP at 9q34.2, ORmeta 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47), P=4.95×10-8. Both loci showed nominally significant association in both the Spanish and Italian sub-analysis.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !b self assert = At 9q34.2 the association signal was restricted to the ABO blood group gene. Accordingly, the distribution of ABO blood groups, as predicted from combinations of genotypes of three different SNPs was skewed in Covid-19 patients with respiratory failure compared with controls, with higher risk for A-positive individuals (meta-analysis result OR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75, P=1.48×10-4) and a protective effect for blood group O (meta-analysis result: OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79, P=1.06×10-5). Both associations and effect directions were consistent in the separate Spain-only and Italian-only case-control analysis. We found no difference in blood group distribution between patients receiving oxygen supplementation only vs. mechanical ventilation of any kind.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !c self assert = Our data thus aligns with the suggestions that blood group O is associated with lower risk compared with non-O blood groups whereas blood group A is associated with higher risk of acquiring Covid-19 compared with non-A blood groups. Unlike for Chromosome 3, we found no difference between patients receiving oxygen supplementation only and those with mechanical ventilation any kind. However, it should be noted that the lead SNP at the ABO locus in our study (rs657152) has been associated with elevated interleukin-6 (IL6) levels in childhood obesity in previous GWAS27, providing a hypothetical link to the established association of elevated IL-6 with severity and mortality of Covid-19.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !d self assert = We found that the frequency of the risk allele GA of the lead SNP, rs11385942, was higher in patients with mechanical ventilation compared with those receiving oxygen supplementation only with an OR=1.70, 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.26, P=0.00033, in the unadjusted analysis. Available database entries suggest that the frequency of the risk allele of rs11385942 varies between populations world-wide and is monomorphic in China

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !e self assert = Since several viral infections are known to be controlled by genetic variation at the HLA complex at chromosome 6p21, we scrutinized the extended HLA region (chr6:25-34Mb). There were no SNP or allele associations signals at the HLA complex meeting neither genome-wide nor suggestive association significance threshold of P=1×10-5. Furthermore, we found no significant differences in allelic distribution between patients with oxygen supplementation only and those with mechanical ventilation of any kind (assessed by direct HLA typing, data not shown).

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !f self assert =  Furthermore, genetic variation at the ABO locus has previously been associated with a number of procoagulant markers such as von Willebrand factor and Factor VIII, and the potential relationship between our genetic findings and the significant coagulopathy that is observed in severe Covid-19 warrants further attention.

  head = We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.

  >>> Abstract
    Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.

  let !a self assert = Our phylogenetic analysis shows a high diversity of CoVs from bats sampled in China, with most bat genera included in this study (10/16) infected by both α- and β-CoVs. In our phylogenetic analysis that includes all known bat-CoVs from China, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is likely derived from a clade of viruses originating in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.)

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !b self assert = The geographic location of this origin appears to be Yunnan province. However, it is important to note that: 1) our study collected and analyzed samples solely from China; 2) many sampling sites were close to the borders of Myanmar and Lao PDR; and 3) most of the bats sampled in Yunnan also occur in these countries, including R. affinis and R. malayanus, the species harboring the CoVs with highest RdRp sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. For these reasons, we cannot rule out an origin for the clade of viruses that are progenitors of SARS-CoV-2 that is outside China, and within Myanmar, Lao PDR, Vietnam or another Southeast Asian country.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !c self assert = Additionally, our analysis shows that the virus RmYN02 from R. malayanus, which is characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein, belongs to the same clade as both RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, providing further support for the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats in the region.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !d self assert = Finally, while our analysis shows that the RdRp sequences of coronaviruses from the Malayan pangolin are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, analysis of full genomes of these viruses suggest that these terrestrial mammals are less likely to be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 than Rhinolophus spp. bats.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !e self assert = This analysis also demonstrates that a significant amount of cross-species transmission has occurred among bat hosts over evolutionary time. Our Bayesian phylogeographic inference and analysis of host switching showed varying levels of viral connectivity among bat hosts and allowed us to identify significant host transitions that appear to have occurred during bat-CoV evolution in China.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !f self assert = The ancient likely origin of the Rhinolophidae in Asia and China in particular may explain the central role they played in the evolution and diversification of bat-CoVs in this region, including SARSr-CoVs, MERS-cluster CoVs, and SADSr-CoVs, which contain important human and livestock pathogens. Horseshoe bats are known to share roosts with genera from all other bat families in this study, which may also favor CoV crossspecies transmission from and to rhinolophids34 280 . A global meta-analysis showing higher rates of viral sharing among co-roosting cave bats supports this finding.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !g self assert = Vespertilionid and miniopterid bats (largely within the Myotis and Miniopterus genera) also appear to have been involved in several significant host switches during α-CoV evolution. However, no significant transition from vespertilionid bats was identified for β-CoVs and these bats exhibit a divergent β-CoV diversity compared to other bat families. Vespertilionid and miniopterid bats are characterized by strong basal phylogenetic clustering but high recent CoV diversification rates, indicating a more rapid evolutionary radiation of CoVs in these bat hosts. At the genus level, similar findings were observed for the genera Myotis, Pipistrellus and Miniopterus.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !h self assert = A significant correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation of both α- and β-CoVs has been detected, even if only a relatively small proportion of the variance is explained by geographic distance.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = We revealed a significant effect of host phylogeny on β-CoV evolution while it had a minimal effect on α-CoV diversity. Contrary to the α-CoV phylogeny, the basal phylogenetic structure of β-CoVs mirrored the phylogeny of their bat hosts, with a clear distinction b/w the Yangochiroptera, encompassing the Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae, and the Yinpterochiroptera, which includes the megabat family Pteropodidae and the microbat families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae, as evidenced in recent bat phylogenies. These findings suggest a profound co-macroevolutionary process between β-CoVs & their bat hosts, even if host switches also occurred throughout their evolution as our study showed. The phylogenetic structure of α-CoVs, with numerous & closely related lineages identified in the Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae, contrasts with the β-CoV macroevolutionary pattern and suggests α-CoVs have undergone an adaptive radiation in these two Yangochiroptera families.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = Our BSSVS procedure and Markov jump estimates revealed higher connectivity, both qualitatively and quantitatively, among bat families and genera in the α-CoV cross303 species transmission history. Larger numbers of highly significant host transitions and higher rates oswitching events along these pathways were of inferred for α- than β-CoVs, especially at the host family level. These findings suggest that α-CoVs are able to switch hosts more frequently and between more distantly related taxa, and that phylogenetic distance among hosts represents a higher constraint on host switches for β- than α-CoVs. This is supported by more frequent dispersal events in the evolution of α- than β-CoVs in China.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !j self assert = We also found that some bat genera were infected by a single CoV genus: Miniopterus (Miniopteridae) and Murina (Vespertilionidae) carried only α-CoVs, while Cynopterus, Eonycteris, Megaerops (Pteropodidae) and Pipistrellus (Vespertilionidae) hosted only β-CoVs. This was found despite using the same conserved pan-CoV PCR assays for all specimens screened and it can’t be explained by differences in sampling effort for these genera: for example, >250 α-CoV sequences but no β-CoV were discovered in Miniopterus bats in China during our recent fieldwork. These migratory bats, which seem to have played a key role in the evolution of α-CoVs, share roosts with several other bat genera hosting β-CoVs in China57 326 , suggesting high likelihood of being exposed to β-CoVs. Biological or ecological properties of miniopterid bats may explain this observation and clearly warrant further investigation.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !k self assert = Coronaviruses use a large diversity of receptors, and their entry into host cells is mediated by the spike protein with an ectodomain consisting of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membranefusion subunit S2. However, despite differences in the core structure of their S1 receptor binding domains (RBD), several α- and β-CoV species are able to recognize and bind to the same host receptors. Other factors such as mutation rate, recombination potential, or replication rate might also be involved in differences in host switching potential between α- and β-CoVs. A better understanding of receptor usage and other biological characteristics of these bat-CoVs may help predict their cross318 species transmission and zoonotic potential.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !l self assert = Our Bayesian ancestral reconstructions revealed the importance of South western and Southern China as centers of diversification for both α- and β-CoVs. These two regions are hotspots of CoV phylogenetic diversity, harboring evolutionarily old and phylogenetically diverse lineages of α- and β-CoVs. South western China acted as a refugium during Quaternary glaciation for numerous plant and animal species including several bat species, such as Rhinolophus affinis65, Rhinolophus sinicus66, Myotis davidii, and Cynopterus sphinx68. The stable and long-term persistence of bats and other mammals throughout the Quaternary may explain the deep macroevolutionary diversity of bat-CoVs in these regions. Several highly significant and ancient CoV dispersal routes from these two regions have been identified in this study. Other viruses, such as the Avian Influenza A viruses H5N6, H7N9 and H5N1, also likely originated in South western and Southern Chinese regions.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !m self assert = Our findings suggest that bat host diversity is not the main driver of CoV diversity in China and that other ecological or biogeographic factors may influence this diversity. Overall, there were no significant correlations between CoV phylogenetic diversity and bat species diversity (total or sampled) for each province or biogeographic region, apart from a weak correlation between β-CoV phylogenetic diversity and the number of bat species sampled at the province level. Yet, we observed higher than expected phylogenetic diversity in several southern provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Hunan). These results and main conclusions are consistent and robust even when we account for geographic biases in sampling effort by analyzing random subsets of the data.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !n self assert = In this study, we identified the host taxa and geographic regions that together define hotspots of CoV phylogenetic diversity and centers of diversification in China. These findings may provide a strategy for targeted discovery of bat-borne CoVs of zoonotic or livestock infection potential, and for early detection of bat-CoV outbreaks in livestock and people, as proposed elsewhere . Our results suggest that future sampling and viral discovery should target two hotspots of CoV diversification in Southern and South western China in particular, as well as neighboring countries where similar bat species live. These regions are characterized by a subtropical to tropical climate; dense, growing and rapidly urbanizing populations of people; a high degree of poultry and livestock production; and other factors which may promote cross-species transmission and disease emergence.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !o self assert = Additionally, faster rates of evolution in the tropics have been described for other RNA viruses which could favor cross-species transmission of RNA viruses in these regions. Both SARS-CoV and SADS-CoV emerged in this region, and several bat SARSr-CoVs with high zoonotic potential have recently been reported from there, although the dynamics of their circulation in wild bat populations remain poorly understood. Importantly, the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2, a SARS-related virus, was found in a Rhinolophus sp. bat in this region, although it is important to note that our survey was limited to China, and that the bat hosts of this virus also occur in nearby Myanmar and Lao PDR.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !p self assert = Because intensive sampling has not, to our knowledge, been undertaken in countries bordering southern China, these surveys should be extended to include Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Vietnam, and perhaps across southeast Asia. Our finding that Rhinolophus spp. are most likely to be involved in host switching events makes them a key target for future longitudinal surveillance programs, but surveillance targeted the genera Hipposideros and Aselliscus may also be fruitful as they share numerous β-CoVs with Rhinolophus bats.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !q self assert = We have shown that α-CoVs have a higher propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADSCoV in pigs in Guangdong province. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in bats, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the human population. Future work discovering and characterizing the biological properties of bat α-CoVs may therefore be of potential value for public and livestock health.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !r self assert = Our study, and recent analysis of viral discovery rates, suggest that a substantially wider sampling and discovery net will be required to capture the complete diversity of coronaviruses in their natural hosts and assess their potential for cross-species transmission. The bat genera Rhinolophus, Hipposideros, Myotis and Miniopterus, all involved in numerous naturally-occurring host switches throughout α-CoV evolution, should be a particular target for α-CoV discovery in China and across southeast Asia, with in vitro and experimentalcharacterization to better understand their potential to infect people or livestock and cause disease.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !s self assert = The rate of inter-family host switching events was five times higher in the evolutionary history of α- (0.010 host switches/unit time) than β-CoVs (0.002 host switches/unit time) in China. For α-CoVs, host switching events from the Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae were greater than from other bat families while rhinolophids were the highest donor family for β-CoVs. The Rhinolophidae and the Vespertilionidae for α-CoVs and th Hipposideridae for β-CoVs received the highest numbers of switching events. When using the random dataset, similar results were obtained for β-CoVs while rhinolophids were the highest donor family for α-CoVs.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !t self assert = Most of the significant cross-genus CoV switches for α-CoVs, 15 of 20 (75%), were between genera in different bat families, while this proportion was only 6 of 16 (37.5%) for β-CoVs. The estimated rate of inter-genus host switching events (Markov jumps) was similar for α- (0.014 host switches/unit time) and β-CoVs (0.014 host switches/unit time). For α-CoVs, Rhinolophus and Miniopterus were the greatest donor genera and Rhinolophus was the greatest receiver. For β-CoVs, Rousettus was the greatest donor and Eonycteris the greatest receiver genus.

  head = Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies.

  >>> Abstract
    Knowing the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections is essential for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic. The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available. Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies.

  let !a self assert = After modeling the available national data on cumulative deaths and detected COVID-19 cases in the United States, the IFR-S from COVID-19 was estimated to be 1.3%. This estimated rate is substantially higher than the approximate IFR-S of seasonal influenza, which is about 0.1%19 (34,200 deaths among 35.5 million patients who got sick with influenza). Influenza is also believed to be completely asymptomatic in 16% of the infected population,20 and this fraction is not included in the calculation of its IFR-S.

  let !b self assert = The posterior means and the 95% credible intervals of county-specific IFR-Ss for twenty counties with the lowest rates (0.5%–1.4%) (plus the overall values for the U.S.) and twenty-one counties with the highest rates (2.3%–3.6%) are shown in supplemental exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.5 The IFR-S for other counties in the middle that are not shown ranged from 1.5% to 2.2%. The lowest rate was estimated to be in Putnam County, NY, (0.5%, 95% CCI: 0.1%–1.0%) while the highest in King County, WA (3.6%, 95%CCI: 0.5%–6.1%). Data at the county level are still evolving, and hence considerable uncertainty exists for some counties, especially towards the higher range of IFR-S estimates.

  / May, 2020 - HEALTH AFFAIRS
  let !c self assert = Supplemental exhibit 35 presents the comparison between predicted and observed rates, where each dot in the exhibit represents a rate for a county on a given day. It shows that the 95% central credible intervals from the posterior predictive distribution from the model were able to capture the true CFR rates (represented by the 45-degree diagonal line) for all counties over these four days. The Bayesian posterior predictive two-sided p-values17,18 were less than 0.05 for none of the 116 counties for any of the four days.

  / May, 2020 - HEALTH AFFAIRS
  let !d self assert = Since these estimates represent the crude IFR-S, many factors contribute to their variation across counties, including demographics (especially age distribution), levels of population health, and supply of healthcare. In that sense, IFR-S is a dynamic quantity even within a county, depending on how the case-mix of the infected population shifts over time.

  / May, 2020 - HEALTH AFFAIRS
  let !e self assert = Our COVID-19 IFR-S estimate is not outside the ballpark of estimates becoming available from other countries, but certainly lower, as expected from addressing the upward bias in those estimates. For example, the COVID-19 fatality rate for China (without correction for the upward bias inherent in looking at observed rates) was initially reported to be 5.6% (95% CI: 5.4–5.8%).22 By February 20, the crude fatality rate for China was estimated to be 3.8%.23 The fatality rate outside China was estimated to be 15.2% (95% CI 12.5–17.9%),22 which may be due to the more considerable upward bias during the beginning part of the pandemic within a county. We see the same patterns in the United States, with observed rates being much higher during the initial part of the pandemic. A recent estimate of CFR using individual-level data from Wuhan residents and also international Wuhan residents who repatriated on six flights was found to range from 0.66% to 1.4%.

  / May, 2020 - HEALTH AFFAIRS
  let !f self assert = If we carry out a thought experiment where 35.5 million individuals would contract COVID-19 illness this year in the US (i.e., the same number as flu last year)19 then, in the absence of any mitigation strategies or social distancing behaviors and the supply of health care services under typical conditions, our IFR-S estimate predicts that there would have been nearly 500,000 COVID-19 deaths this year. To the extent that COVID-19 is more infectious than flu and does not have any protection from a vaccine or treatment, the number of infections, and hence the number of deaths, would be higher. Certainly, with mitigation strategies, the death toll will be lower.

  / May, 2020 - HEALTH AFFAIRS
  let !g self assert = Our estimated IFR-S applies under the assumption that the current supply (until April 20) of health care services, including hospital beds, ventilators, and access to healthcare providers, would continue in the future. Constraints in the supply of health care services could surely increase IFR and the overall fatality rates. We hope that simulations to understand and forecast the impact of such shortages can be improved using our estimates of IFR-S as the baseline.

    MERS-CoV seronegative and seropositive camels received a single intramuscular dose of ChAdOx1 MERS, a replication-deficient adenoviral vectored vaccine expressing MERS-CoV spike protein, with further groups receiving control vaccinations. Infectious camels with active naturally acquired MERS-CoV infection, were co-housed with the vaccinated camels at a ratio of 1:2 (infected:vaccinated); nasal discharge and virus titres were monitored for 14 days. Overall, the vaccination reduced virus shedding and nasal discharge (p = 0.0059 and p = 0.0274, respectively). Antibody responses in seropositive camels were enhancedby the vaccine; these camels had a higher average age than seronegative. Older seronegative camels responded more strongly to vaccination than younger animals; and neutralising antibodies were detected in nasal swabs. Further work is required to optimise vaccine regimens for younger seronegative camels.

  let !a self assert = In this study, we demonstrated that boosting humoral immune responses in MERS-CoV seropositive camels requires a single intramuscular dose of ChAdOx1 MERS, whereas at least two doses of vaccine were required to induce Abs in young seronegative camels (<1 year). Interestingly, older seronegative calves (1–2 years) responded to a single dose of the vaccine and elicited systemic and local nAbs. As the history of MERS-CoV exposure in these camels is not known, it is possible that older camels found here to be seronegative may have had some natural exposure to MERS-CoV but their Abs had then declined prior to their inclusion in the study as reported previously

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !b self assert = It is also possible that these seronegative calves were truly immune naive to MERS-CoV and that greater vaccine responsiveness occurs in older animals with a more mature immune system. It is very unlikely that maternal Abs play any part in the lack of vaccine responsiveness in younger calves because ChAdOx1 MERS is a viral vectored vaccine that does not express MERS S protein on the virion surface and so will not be affected by pre-existing Abs at the time of vaccination.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !c self assert = Vaccination resulted in a statistically significant reduction in virus shedding after co-housing with infectious camels in both seropositive and seronegative camels. Whereas virus shedding was minimal from seropositive vaccinated camels, further optimisation is required to enhance protection in seronegative camels including the number of doses and route of immunisation.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !d self assert = Of note, we show here that in older seronegative camels, nAbs in nasal secretions were induced after a single intramuscular vaccination of ChAdOx1 MERS, but cannot rule out the possibility that these camels had previously been exposed to MERS-CoV despite proving seronegative on entry to the study, and the effects of intramuscular boosting after initial mucosal priming may be different from intramuscular priming of truly MERS-naive camels.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !e self assert = Infectious camels were not removed from the pen after co-housing to mimic natural conditions. Even under these stringent conditions one camel in group +V demonstrated complete absence of virus shedding, with two others (out of a total of 5) in the same group shedding extremely low levels of virus, indicating that high levels of protective immunity can be achieved. Importantly, this group had high level of nAbs that plateaued for a year, unlike the +C group that had decreasing nAb titres overtime. These results suggest that vaccinating seropositive camels with S-based vaccine could boost their pre-existing MERS-specific immunity and minimise viral shedding.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !f self assert = Nonetheless, following single dose vaccination, virus shedding was reduced in both seropositive and seronegative camels, which would reduce the likelihood of transmission to other camels or humans.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !g self assert = In the current study, we found that induction of S1-binding non-neutralising Abs alone is insufficient to reduce viral shedding and only the presence of nAbs can minimise virus excretion.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !h self assert = Nonetheless, previous studies suggest that only presence of high levels on nAb titres may provide sterilising immunity in dromedaries as even seropositive camels could be re-infected as nAbs wane over time. Our study also clearly confirms that MERS-CoV re-infection occur in dromedaries.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !i self assert = Virus shedding continued for up to 14 days, indicating an average time for the course of MERS infection in pen-housed camels. Notably, although seronegative younger calves responded with high level of Abs after prime-boost, as mentioned above, they did not show significant different in nasal discharge nor in virus titre, as compared to the prime-only seronegative younger calves (in group −V). This indicate that inducing protective immunogenicity in seronegative calves needs stringent and optimal vaccination regimens.

  / November, 2019 - Scientific Reports
  let !j self assert = This study also presents a significant correlation between in-house ELISA and commercially available ELISA kits although low level of antibodies in some samples were detected only by in-house ELISA, previous reports showed that commercial ELISA kits may have low sensitivity.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107725
ref 'Lv_et_al_06_02_2020
  head = Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future.

  >>> Summary
    The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development.

  let !a self assert = Patient Samples Show Cross-Reactivity in Binding: When compared with the plasma from healthy donors, plasma from patients from day 11 post-symptom onward have significant binding to the S ectodomain (p < 2e−16, two-tailed t test) and RBD (p = 2e−13, two-tailed t test) of SARS-CoV-2. The observation that none of the plasma from patients on or before day 11 post-symptom binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain and RBD is consistent with a previous study that showed seroconversion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients can be as late as 14 days after symptom onset.

  / June, 2020 - Cell Reports
  let !b self assert = Nevertheless, only five of the samples from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (patient nos. 4, 6, 11, 14, and 15) had convincing antibody-binding responses to the SARS-CoV RBD (optical density 450 [OD450] > 0.5). However, all samples were collected within 22 days after symptom onset, which is fairly early in the maturation of the humoral immune response, when antibody titers are still increasing. It is possible that more samples would have detectable cross-reactive binding to the SARS-CoV RBD if collected at later time points.

  / June, 2020 - Cell Reports
  let !c self assert = These results indicate that the cross-reactive antibody response to the S protein after SARS-CoV-2 infection targets both RBD and non-RBD regions. Consistent with that observation, reactivity of the plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could be detected with the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (p = 2e−4, two-tailed t test;

  / June, 2020 - Cell Reports
  let !d self assert = We also analyzed seven heparin-anticoagulated, convalescent (3–6 months after infection) plasma samples from SARS-CoV-infected patients. Similar to that observed in plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, cross-reactivity in binding could be detected. As compared with the plasma from healthy donors, SARS-CoV-infected patients have significant cross-reactivity in binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (p = 0.03, two-tailed t test), RBD (p = 0.03, two-tailed t test), and the S2 subunit (p = 0.007, two-tailed t test). These findings show that cross-reactivity in binding is common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in both directions. Of note, our recombinant S ectodomains of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV contained several mutations to stabilize the prefusion conformation, which should not affect most neutralizing epitopes.

  / June, 2020 - Cell Reports
  let !e self assert = Patient Samples Show Limited Cross-Neutralization: However, only one plasma sample could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, with very low neutralization activity (1:10). In fact, that cross-neutralizing plasma sample had the strongest reactivity in binding against SARS-CoV S ectodomain among all 15 patient samples, although its binding activity against SARS-CoV RBD was not the strongest.

  / June, 2020 - Cell Reports
  let !f self assert = Although five of the seven plasma samples from SARS-CoV-convalescent patients could neutralize SARS-CoV with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:320, none could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2. These results show that although cross-reactivity in binding is common between plasma from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-infected patients, cross-neutralization activity may be rare.

  let !g self assert = Cross-Reactivity in Mouse Infection and Immunization:  As compared with controls, plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 virus had significant binding to its autologous S ectodomain (p < 0.002, two-tailed t test) and RBD (p < 1e−4, two-tailed t test). Similarly, plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV virus had significant binding to its autologous S ectodomain (p < 2e−7, two-tailed t test) and RBD (p < 6e−6, two-tailed t test). In addition, plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV S ectodomain could react to its autologous RBD (p < 0.02, two-tailed t test).

  let !h self assert =  However, although plasma from mice infected with SARS-CoV virus could react with its autologous S ectodomain (p < 8e−6, two-tailed t test) and RBD (p < 2e−5, two-tailed t test), the reactivity of plasma from mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to its autologous S ectodomain and RBD could not be observed in this assay (p > 0.28, two-tailed t test). As expected, an antibody response from SARS-CoV-2-infected wild-type mice was not detected because of the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in wild-type mice.

  / June, 2020 - Cell Reports
  let !i self assert = Interestingly, we observed some cross-reactivity of plasma from SARS-CoV-2-immunized mice to both the SARS-CoV S ectodomain (p < 4e−5, two-tailed t test) and the SARS-CoV RBD (p < 0.006, two-tailed t test), as well as plasma from SARS-CoV-infected mice to the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (p < 0.005, two-tailed t test) but not to the RBD. Of note, the absence of detectable binding of plasma from SARS-CoV-infected mice to SARS-CoV-2 RBD could be due to the overall weak cross-reactive antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, as indicated by the relatively weak binding to the CoV-2 S ectodomain (OD450 ranges from 0.3 to 0.8). The lack of detectable binding of plasma from SARS-CoV-immunized mice to either SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain or RBD (p > 0.5, two-tailed t test) could be due to the overall low antibody response.

  head =  Studying over 1,400 hospitalized patients in a month, we established that COVID-19 is associated with high levels of all four cytokines at presentation. Importantly, our observations indicate that cytokine patterns are predictive of COVID-19 survival and mortality, independently of demographics, comorbidities, but also of standard clinical biomarkers of diseases severity, including laboratory and clinical factors. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.

  >>> Abstract
    The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.

  let !c self assert = We found that IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a were significantly elevated in COVID-19 serum compared to healthy donor serum or plasma isolated from CAR-T cell treated patients with no CRS. The four cytokines assessed had different detection ranges, with IL-6 having the most dynamic profile, followed by IL-8, and TNF-a. In line with previous reports, IL-1b levels were mostly low or at the limit of detection (even though controls worked as expected).

  let !d self assert = We hypothesized that cytokines are elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors and non-CRS CAR-T treated patients due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite similar comorbidities, cytokine levels in this subset of patients were significantly lower compared to patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

With increased age brackets (<50, 50-70, >70 years old), levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a increased and the same was observed for age when assessed as a continuous variable.

  let !f self assert = There was no association of any cytokine measured with body mass index, however, there is an increased prevalence of obesity in our studied population. Smoking and race/ethnicity showed weak but significant univariate associations with IL-6, IL-1b, and/or TNF-a which were not confirmed after adjusting for the other covariates, except for IL-1b and TNF-a which remained significantly higher when comparing Hispanics to African Americans.

  let !h self assert = Time to ELLA testing from time of hospital admission did not impact the cytokine levels, meaning whether patients were tested for cytokines immediately upon admission or later (as will be discussed in the longitudinal follow-up section) did not impact the level of cytokines. Therefore, this time difference was not considered as a potential confounder.

  let !i self assert = Using multivariable regression models, we confirmed that CKD was the only comorbidity significantly associated with elevated cytokine levels, while elevated TNF-a in patients with diabetes and hypertension were explained by other variables. From demographics, age and sex (for IL-6) remained significantly associated with cytokine levels as seen in univariate analyses.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !j self assert = We found that only age and CKD were significantly associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19. We found that each cytokine could predict the overall survival of patients, based on the first available measurement following hospital admission.

  let !k self assert = When considering all cytokines together in the model, for their relative independence, all but IL-1b remained significant, even after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities. This confirmed the relative independence of each cytokine tested, with only age (50-70 vs. >70, HR 0.55 [0.42-0.72]; <50 vs. >70: 0.24 [0.15-0.41]), IL-6 (HR 2.27 [1.65-3.12], IL-8 (HR 1.48 [1.11- 1.97]), and TNF-a (HR 1.50 [1.10-2.05]) remaining significantly associated with decreased survival after adjustments (respectively p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.0076, p=0.0105).

  let !l self assert = As additional validation, we also performed this analysis using a competing risk model, in which patients discharged alive were considered competing events and patients in hospital were censored, and found the same conclusion, where high IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a remained significantly associated with worse outcome regardless of demographics and comorbidities (not shown).

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !m self assert = We first tested whether the 4 tested cytokine levels were associated with known inflammation markers CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin, and found strong correlations in all cytokine with each measurement, with IL-6 and IL-1b additionally associated with fever. In addition, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were closely correlated with severity scale, which takes into account lung imaging and use of ventilation and end organ damage, while TNF-a did not distinguish moderate vs. severe COVID-19 presentation, but instead was only increased with end organ damage.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !n self assert = Looking at the predictive value of cytokines on survival after adjusting for levels of CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, and all comorbidities, IL-6 and IL-8 remained independently predictive of survival, therefore showing additive value to these known markers (not shown). However, when including additional severity metrics, severity scoring, IL-8 was no longer independent from other variables, likely because it was eclipsed by stronger measurements which follows a similar pattern.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !o self assert = Using unsupervised analyses, neutrophils, white blood cells, CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, and low O2 saturation were co-clustering with all cytokines except TNF-a, which was more closely correlated with markers of tissue damage like creatinin.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !p self assert = We conclude that IL-6 and TNF-a are independently predictive of patient outcomes in terms of both disease severity and survival. Even after stratifying for risk factors with the strongest p value, i.e. severity score, O2 saturation, and age, IL-6 and TNF-a remained independently predictive of survival.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !q self assert = Interestingly, the COVID-19-related cytokine response was quite distinct from the traditional cytokine storm associated with sepsis and CAR-T cells, with sustained elevated cytokine levels over days and weeks, and relative absence of coordination among them. This raises possibilities of honing on mitigation strategies with anti-cytokine treatments, though which one(s) and the window of opportunity for their use remain to be established. Guiding such therapies based on mechanistic association with cytokine levels could provide a rational approach.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !r self assert = There are no available data correlating levels of IL-6 and response to treatment, and none of the current studies have used cytokine profiling as part of their inclusion criteria. It is possible that patients with moderate disease and high IL-6 levels will best benefit from cytokine blockade. There is also a need to evaluate the effect of anti-TNF-a therapy on its own in COVID-19. Since IL-6 and TNFa appear to be independent variables, studies with combination regimen blocking both cytokines would be important to consider for added clinical efficacy

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !s self assert = Interestingly, off-label treatment with the anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody tocilizumab, which was given in a subset of patients with progressive respiratory failure with marked systemic inflammation, showed that patients who received this drug started with elevated IL-6 levels, and then had a transient increase in serum IL-6, which has previously been explained by disrupted clearance following drug saturation of the IL-6 receptor. This transient elevation was only observed for IL-6, not IL-8, while TNF-a appeared gradually decrease following therapy.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !t self assert = Other treatments such as corticosteroids and remdesivir showed, respectively, a rapid and gradual reduction in IL-6 over time compared to patients who did not receive these drugs, but no effect on TNF-a, while hydroxychloroquine, acetaminophen, or anti-coagulants did not clearly appear to alter cytokine levels.The clinical outcome of patients stratified based on IL-6 levels will need to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !u self assert = Early cytokine measurements are reliable predictors of outcome and therefore raise the critical importance of using serum cytokine levels for treatment decisions. The predictive value of these cytokines may help to inform therapeutic interventions to determine which individuals are likely to develop respiratory failure, end organ damage, and death. Cytokine levels can serve to evaluate appropriateness for pharmacotherapy with available or experimental agents and to select optimal trial designs to disrupt the underlying inflammatory milieu. A prediction model built on cytokine levels early in disease may serve to inform health care allocation and prioritization of individuals at highest risk.

// Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31142-9
ref 'Chu_et_al_06_01_2020
  head = The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support that physical distancing of at least 1 m is strongly associated with protection, but distances of up to 2 m might be more effective. Although direct evidence is limited, the optimum use of face masks, in particular N95 or similar respirators in health-care settings and 12–16-layer cotton or surgical masks in the community, could depend on contextual factors; action is needed at all levels to address the paucity of better evidence. Eye protection might provide additional benefits.

  >>> Background
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.

  >>> Methods
    We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047.

  >>> Findings
    Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 to −7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD −10·6%, 95% CI −12·5 to −7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.

  >>> Interpretations
    The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

At the moment, although there is consensus that SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads through large droplets and contact, debate continues about the role of aerosol, but our meta-analysis provides evidence (albeit of low certainty) that respirators might have a stronger protective effect than surgical masks. Nevertheless, our findings suggest it plausible that even in the absence of aerosolisation, respirators might be simply more effective than masks at preventing infection.

// COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer on chemotherapy or other anticancer treatments: a prospective cohort study
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31173-9
ref 'Lee_et_al_05_28_2020
  head = Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

  >>> Background
    Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer.

  >>> Methods
    In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission.

  >>> Findings
    From March 18, to April 26, 2020, we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52%) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28%) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 9·42 [95% CI 6·56–10·02]; p<0·0001), being male (1·67 [1·19–2·34]; p=0·003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (1·95 [1·36–2·80]; p<0·001) and cardiovascular disease (2·32 [1·47–3·64]). 281 (35%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (1·18 [0·81–1·72]; p=0·380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks.

  >>> Interpretation
    Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

// Cumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New York
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.25.20113050
ref 'Rosenberg_et_al_05_29_2020
  head =  Over 2 million adults were infected through late March 2020, with substantial variations by subpopulations. As this remains below herd immunity thresholds and as the epidemic grows in other regions of the country, this study offers a potential model for other jurisdictions to monitor their epidemic. Estimates of cumulative incidence can be combined with diagnostic totals, or other epidemic markers such as mortality, to provide a holistic epidemic view during a time of unprecedented pandemic and to best craft high-impact approaches to prevention, containment, treatment and mitigation.

  >>> Importance
    New York State (NYS) is an epicenter of the United States' COVID-19 epidemic. Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies, but US data are lacking, in part because societal closure complicates study conduct.

  >>> Objective
    To estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and percent of infections diagnosed in New York State, overall and by region, age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Design: Statewide cross-sectional seroprevalence study, conducted April 19-28, 2020.

  >>> Design
    Grocery stores (n=99) located in 26 counties throughout NYS, which were essential businesses that remained open during a period of societal closure and attract a heterogenous clientele.

  >>> Setting
    Convenience sample of patrons >=18 years and residing in New York State, recruited consecutively upon entering stores and via an in-store flyer.

  >>> Participants
    Convenience sample of patrons >=18 years and residing in New York State, recruited consecutively upon entering stores and via an in-store flyer.

  >>> Exposures
    Region (New York City, Westchester/Rockland, Long Island, Rest of New York State), age, sex, race and ethnicity.

  >>> Main Outcomes
    Primary outcome: cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on dry-blood spot (DBS) SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity; secondary outcome: percent of infections diagnosed.

  >>> Results
    Among 15,101 adults with suitable DBS specimens, 1,887 (12.5%) were reactive using a validated SARS-CoV-2 IgG microsphere immunoassay (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 99.75%). Following post-stratification weighting on region, sex, age, and race and ethnicity and adjustment for assay characteristics, estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%, 95% CI: 27.2-31.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2% 95% CI, 18.1-22.3%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%, 95% CI: 9.4-15.4%) adults than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, 95% CI: 7.4-8.7%, p<.0001). Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5%-24.0). Dividing diagnoses reported to NYS by estimated infection-experienced adults, an estimated 8.9% (95% CI: 8.4-9.3%) of infections were diagnosed, with those ≥55 years most likely to be diagnosed (11.3%, 95% CI: 10.4-12.2%).

  >>> Conclusions and Relevance
    Over 2 million adults were infected through late March 2020, with substantial variations by subpopulations. As this remains below herd immunity thresholds, monitoring, testing, and contact tracing remain essential public health strategies.

In sensitivity analyses at the extremes of test characteristics, cumulative incidence ranged from 9.8% (95% CI: [9.1-10.5%]) to 15.0% (95% CI: [14.3-15.7%]), representing a total of 1,494,700 (95% CI: [1,391,800-1,597600]) to 2,286,600 (95% CI: [2,178,200-2,395,100]) adults in NYS.

Those ≥55 years were most likely to be diagnosed (11.3%, 95% CI: 10.4-12.2%). Diagnosis rates in NYC (7.1%, 95% CI: 6.7-7.5%) and ROS (7.5%, 95% CI: 6.4-8.9%) were about half those observed in the other regions. Considering the May 8 upper-bound for diagnoses, a maximum of 15.7% (95% CI: 15.0-16.5%) of overall infections could have been diagnosed, with similar patterns observed across levels of each factor.

// SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques
doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc4776
ref 'Chandrashekar_et_al_05_20_2020
  head =  In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques induced humoral and cellular immune responses and provided protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. These data raise the possibility that immunologic approaches to the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection may in fact be possible. However, it is critical to emphasize that there are important differences between SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques and humans, with many parameters still yet to be defined in both species, and thus our data should be interpreted cautiously. Rigorous clinical studies will be required to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure in humans.

  >>> Abstract
    An understanding of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for vaccine and public health strategies aimed at ending the global COVID-19 pandemic. A key unanswered question is whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in protective immunity against re-exposure. We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that macaques had high viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, humoral and cellular immune responses, and pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. Following initial viral clearance, animals were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 and showed 5 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa compared with primary infection. Anamnestic immune responses following rechallenge suggested that protection was mediated by immunologic control. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced protective immunity against re-exposure in nonhuman primates.

  let !a self assert = We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that recapitulates many aspects of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, including high levels of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and clear pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, RNAscope, and CyCIF imaging demonstrated multifocal clusters of virus infected cells in areas of acute inflammation, with evidence for virus infection of alveolar pneumocytes and ciliated bronchial epithelial cells. These data suggest the utility of rhesus macaques as a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection for testing vaccines and therapeutics and for studying immunopathogenesis, and our findings complement and extend recently published data in cynomolgus macaques. However, neither nonhuman primate model led to respiratory failure or mortality, and thus further research will be required to develop a nonhuman primate model of severe COVID-19 disease.

  let !b self assert = SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques led to humoral and cellular immune responses and provided protection against rechallenge. Following SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge, animals exhibited rapid anamnestic immune responses, including increased virus-specific ELISA titers (P = 0.0034, two-sided Mann-Whitney test), pseudovirus NAb titers (P = 0.0003), and live virus NAb titers (P = 0.0003) as well as a trend toward increased IFN-γ ELISPOT responses (P = 0.1837) by day 7 after rechallenge. In particular, NAb titers were markedly higher on day 14 following rechallenge compared with day 14 following primary challenge (P < 0.0001, two-sided Mann-Whitney test). All animals developed anamnestic antibody responses following rechallenge, regardless of the presence or absence of residual viral RNA or sgmRNA in BAL or NS, and thus we speculate that the protective efficacy against rechallenge was mediated by rapid immunologic control.

  / May, 2020 - Science
  let !c self assert = We next evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in these animals. All 9 macaques developed binding antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein by ELISA and neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses using both a pseudovirus neutralization assay and a live virus neutralization assay. NAb titers of approximately 100 were observed in all animals on day 35 regardless of dose group (range 83-197 by the pseudovirus neutralization assay and 35-326 by the live virus neutralization assay). But the relative importance of neutralizing antibodies, other functional antibodies, cellular immunity, and innate immunity to protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Moreover, additional research will be required to define the durability of natural immunity.

  / May, 2020 - Science
  let !f self assert = On day 35 following initial viral infection, we rechallenged all 9 rhesus macaques with the same doses of SARS-CoV-2 that were utilized for the primary infection, namely 1.1 × 106 PFU (Group 1; N = 3), 1.1 × 105 PFU (Group 2; N = 3), or 1.1 × 104 PFU (Group 3; N = 3). Viral RNA following rechallenge was higher in NS compared with BAL, but exhibited dose dependence and rapid decline, and median peak viral loads in NS were still >1.7 log10 lower following rechallenge as compared with the primary challenge (P = 0.0011, two-sided Mann-Whitney test). Consistent with these data, plaque assays in BAL and NS samples following rechallenge showed no recoverable virus and were lower than following primary infection (P = 0.009 and 0.002, respectively, two-sided Mann-Whitney tests). Moreover, little or no clinical disease was observed in the animals following rechallenge.

ref 'Yu_et_al_05_20_2020
  head = In this study, we generated a series of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various S immunogens and assessed protective efficacy against intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. We demonstrate vaccine protection with substantial >3.1 and >3.7 log10 reductions in median viral loads in BAL and NS, respectively, in S immunized animals compared with sham controls. Protection was likely not sterilizing but instead appeared to be mediated by rapid immunologic control following challenge. We define NAb titers as an immune correlate of protection, which will accelerate the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.

  >>> Abstract
    The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has made the development of a vaccine a top biomedical priority. In this study, we developed a series of DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and evaluated them in 35 rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. Following vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in >3.1 and >3.7 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, as compared with sham controls. Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates.

  let !g self assert = We identified serum NAb titers, as measured by two independent assays (pseudovirus neutralization and live virus neutralization), as a significant correlate of protection in this study against both lower respiratory tract disease as well as upper respiratory tract disease. It is likely that protection in both anatomic compartments will be necessary for pandemic control, although protection in the upper respiratory tract may be more difficult to achieve. If this NAb correlate proves generalizable across multiple vaccine studies in both NHPs and humans, then this parameter would be a simple and useful benchmark for clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Innate immune effector functions such as ADCD may also contribute to protective efficacy.

  let !h self assert = Animals received 5 mg DNA vaccines by the intramuscular route without adjuvant at week 0 and week 3. After the boost immunization at week 5, we observed S-specific binding antibodies by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) using both a pseudovirus neutralization assay and a live virus neutralization assay. Two animals had binding antibodies at baseline by ELISA, which we speculate might reflect cross-reactivity of other natural primate coronaviruses. NAb titers measured by the pseudovirus neutralization assay correlated with NAb titers measured by the live virus neutralization assay (P < 0.0001, R = 0.8052, two-sided Spearman rank-correlation test). Moreover, NAb titers in the vaccinated macaques (median titer 74; median titer in the S and S.dCT groups 170) were comparable in magnitude to NAb titers in a cohort of 9 convalescent macaques (median titer 106) and a cohort of 27 convalescent humans (median titer 93) who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection

  let !k self assert = We also observed cellular immune responses to pooled S peptides in the majority of vaccinated animals by IFN-γ ELISPOT assays at week 5. Intracellular cytokine staining assays at week 5 demonstrated induction of S-specific IFN-γ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, with lower responses induced by the shorter S1 and RBD immunogens. S-specific IL-4+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were marginal, suggesting induction of Th1-biased cellular immune responses.

High levels of viral RNA were observed in the sham controls with a median peak of 6.46 (range 4.81-7.99) log10 RNA copies/ml in BAL and a median peak of 6.82 (range 5.96-7.96) log10 RNA copies/swab in NS. Lower levels of viral RNA were observed in the vaccine groups, including 1.92 and 2.16 log10 reductions of median peak viral RNA in BAL and NS, respectively, in S vaccinated animals compared with sham controls (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, two-sided Mann-Whitney tests). Viral RNA assays were confirmed by PFU assays, which similarly showed lower infectious virus titers in S vaccinated animals compared with sham controls (P = 0.04, two-sided Mann-Whitney test)

  let !m self assert = The log10 pseudovirus NAb titer at week 5 inversely correlated with peak log10 sgmRNA in both BAL (P < 0.0001, R = −0.6877, two-sided Spearman rank-correlation test) and NS (P = 0.0199, R = −0.4162). Similarly, the log10 live virus NAb titer at week 5 inversely correlated with peak log10 sgmRNA levels in both BAL (P < 0.0001, R = −0.7702) and NS (P = 0.1006, R = −0.3360). These data suggest that vaccine-elicited serum NAb titers may be immune correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We speculate that correlations were more robust with viral loads in BAL compared with viral loads in NS due to intrinsic variability of collecting swabs.

Moreover, NAb titers correlated with most antibody effector functions, except for antibody-mediated NK cell activation (bottom right panel). Taken together, these data suggest a primary role of NAbs in protecting against SARS-CoV-2, supported by certain innate immune effector functions such as ADCD.

  let !p self assert = All animals exhibited anamnestic humoral and cellular immune responses following challenge, including increased ELISA titers, pseudovirus NAb titers, live virus NAb titers, and IFN-γ ELISPOT responses on day 14 after challenge. These data suggest that vaccine protection was probably not sterilizing, including in the 8 of 25 animals that had no detectable sgmRNA in BAL and NS at any timepoint following challenge, but rather was likely mediated by rapid virologic control following challenge.

// Repeated seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a population-based sample from Geneva, Switzerland
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088898
ref 'Stringhini_et_al_2020
  head = Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

  >>> Background
    Assessing the burden of COVID-19 based on medically-attended case counts is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions and the wide spectrum of disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys provide one avenue for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic, overcoming many of these limitations.

  >>> Methods
    Taking advantage of a pool of adult participants from population-representative surveys conducted in Geneva,  Switzerland, we implemented a study consisting of 8 weekly serosurveys among these participants and their household members older than 5 years. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population.

  >>> Results
    In the first three weeks, we enrolled 1335 participants coming from 633 households, with 16% <20 years of age and 53.6% female, a distribution similar to that of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343). This increased to 6.1% (95% CI 2.6-9.33, n=416) in the second, and to 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third week. We found that 5-19 year-olds (6.0%, 95% CI 2.3-10.2%) had similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5%, 95%CI 4.99-11.7), while significantly lower seroprevalence was observed among those 50 and older (3.7%, 95% CI 0.99-6.0, p=0.0008).

  >>> Interpretation
    Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

While there were no meaningful differences in seroprevalence between men and women, we found that 5-19 year olds (6.0%, 95% CI 2.3-10.2%) had a similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5%, 95% CI 4.9-11.7), whereas seroprevalence among those 50 and older (3.7%, 95% CI 0.9-6.0, p<0.01) was significantly lower.  While the sample size of older adults was small, the lower seroprevalence estimates in this group suggest that targeted efforts to reduce social mixing of elderly people with others may have succeeded. However, it remains possible that, because of an age-related compromised ability to generate adaptive immune responses, the elderly develop a lower IgG response fter infection, something that needs further investigation.

  let !c self assert =  With an estimated 48,500 people having developed antibodies (9.7% of 500’000 inhabitants) while 4741 cases were confirmed on April 24th, we observe that there are roughly 10 infections for every COVID-19 confirmed case in Geneva, reflecting the variability in disease severity, testing practices and care-seeking behaviors. Further, we show that three weeks after the peak of confirmed cases, only 1 in 10 people has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, even in one of the more heavily affected areas in Europe. Thus, assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies measured in this study is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Given the time to development of IgG antibodies (1-3 weeks), we expect to continue seeing significant increases in seroprevalence over the coming weeks.

As the world develops plans to find a new balance between minimizing the direct impacts of COVID-19 on those infected and the indirect effects on all of society, serologic studies such as this are critical for providing new insights about transmission and the otherwise hidden immunologic state of the population.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc3517
ref 'Salje_et_al_2020
  head = This study shows the massive impact the French lockdown had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our modeling approach has allowed us to estimate underlying probabilities of infection, hospitalization and death, which is essential for the interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. The forecasts we provide can inform lockdown exit strategies. Our estimates of a low level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 indicates that efficient control measures that limit transmission risk will have to be maintained beyond the 11 May 2020 to avoid a rebound of the epidemic.

  >>> Abstract
    France has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and went into lockdown on the 17 March 2020. Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find 3.6% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.7% die, ranging from 0.001% in those <20 years of age (ya) to 10.1% in those >80ya. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 2.90 to 0.67 (77% reduction). By 11 May 2020, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 2.8 million (range: 1.8–4.7) people, or 4.4% (range: 2.8–7.2) of the population, will have been infected. Population immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave if all control measures are released at the end of the lockdown.

Once hospitalized, on average 19.0% (95% CrI: 18.7–19.4%) patients enter ICU after a mean delay of 1.5 days. We observe an increasing probability of entering ICU with age—however, this drops for those >70ya.

  let !b self assert = Overall, 18.1% (95% CrI: 17.8–18.4) of hospitalized individuals go on to die. The overall probability of death among those infected (the Infection Fatality Ratio, IFR) is 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.4–1.0), ranging from 0.001% in those under 20ya to 10.1% (95% CrI: 6.0–15.6) in those >80ya. Our estimate of overall IFR is similar to other recent studies that found values of between 0.5 and 0.7% for the Chinese epidemic.

This proportion will be 9.9% (range: 6.6–15.7) in Ile-de-France, which includes Paris, and 9.1% (range: 6.0–14.6) in Grand Est, the two most affected regions of the country.

  let !f self assert = Assuming a basic reproductive number of R0 = 3.0, it would require around 65% of the population to be immune for the epidemic to be controlled by immunity alone. Our results therefore strongly suggest that, without a vaccine, herd immunity on its own will be insufficient to avoid a second wave at the end of the lockdown. Efficient control measures need to be maintained beyond the 11 May.

  let !g self assert = We identify two clear subpopulations in those cases that are hospitalized: individuals that die quickly upon hospital admission (15% of fatal cases, mean time to death of 0.67 days) and individuals who die after longer time periods (85% of fatal cases, mean time to death of 13.2 days) (fig. S3). The proportion of fatal cases who die rapidly remains approximately constant across age-groups (fig. S4 and table S3). Potential explanations for different subgroups of fatal cases include heterogeneous patterns of healthcare seeking, access to care, underlying comorbidities, such as metabolic disease and other inflammatory conditions. A role for immunopathogenesis has also been proposed.

At a regional level, we estimate that 58% of infections will be in Ile-de-France and Grand Est combined. We find that the time people spend in ICU appears to differ across the country, which may be due to differences in health care practices

  let !j self assert = A seroprevalence of 3% (range: 0–3%) has been estimated among blood donors in Hauts-de-France, which is consistent with our model predictions (range: 1–3%) for this population if we account for a 10-day delay for seroconversion. Future additional serological data will help further refine estimates of the proportion of the population infected.

  / May, 2020 - Science
  let !k self assert = While we focus on deaths occurring in hospitals, there are also non-hospitalized COVID-19 deaths, including >9000 in retirement homes in France. We explicitly removed retirement home population from our analyses as transmission dynamics may be different in these closed populations. This means our estimates of immunity in the general population are unaffected by deaths in retirement homes, however, in the event of large numbers of non-hospitalized deaths in the wider community, we would underestimate the proportion of the population infected. Analyses of excess death will be important to explore these issues.

  head = We report functional neutralization of INO-4800 immune sera using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay (Fig. 4, Table 1), and PRNT assay against two wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains. As well, we show that INO-4800 induced antibodies block SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding to the host receptor ACE2, using a surrogate neutralization assay. This study highlights the immunogenicity of INO-4800, and further animal studies will test protection against infection.

  >>> Abstract
    The coronavirus family member, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causal agent for the pandemic viral pneumonia disease, COVID-19. At this time, no vaccine is available to control further dissemination of the disease. We have previously engineered a synthetic DNA vaccine targeting the MERS coronavirus Spike (S) protein, the major surface antigen of coronaviruses, which is currently in clinical study. Here we build on this prior experience to generate a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The engineered construct, INO-4800, results in robust expression of the S protein in vitro. Following immunization of mice and guinea pigs with INO-4800 we measure antigen-specific T cell responses, functional antibodies which neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and biodistribution of SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies to the lungs. This preliminary dataset identifies INO-4800 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting further translational study.

Humoral and T cell responses were observed in mice. In guinea pigs we employed clinical delivery parameters and observed SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding antibody titers and blocking of ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction in serum samples from INO-4800-treated animals. nAbs were also measured in both species.

  let !c self assert = Based upon our previous experience developing a vaccine against MERS coronavirus, and previous published studies of SARS vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 S protein was chosen as the antigen target. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a class I membrane fusion protein, which the major envelope protein on the surface of coronaviruses. In vivo immunogenicity studies in both mouse and guinea pig models revealed levels of S protein-reactive IgG in the serum of INO-4800 immunized animals. In addition to full-length S1 + S2 and S1, INO-4800 immunization induced RBD binding antibodies, a domain known to be a target for nAbs from SARS-CoV convalescent patients. We further demonstrate the functionality of these antibodies through neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus and pseudovirus, and competitive inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor in the presence of sera from INO-4800 immunized animals.

  let !f self assert = We believe synthetic DNA medicine platform has several synergistic characteristics which position it well to respond to disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19. As mentioned previously, the ability to design and immediately synthesize candidate vaccine constructs means that in vitro and in vivo testing can potentially begin within days of receiving the viral sequence. The DNA plasmid manufacture process allows for scalable manufacture of drug product, which has the potential to circumvent the complexities of conventional vaccine production in eggs or cell culture.

In the context of a pandemic outbreak, the stability profile of a vaccine plays directly to its ability to be deployed and stockpiled in an efficient and executable manner. In this study, we observed seroconversion after a single intradermal administration of the INO-4800 in guinea pigs (Fig. 6). Whether a single immunization will be sufficient in humans will be investigated in clinical trials.

  let !h self assert = It is important to note the majority of studies demonstrating CoV vaccine-induced immunopathology utilized the BALB/c mouse, a model known to preferentially develop Th2-type responses. The DNA vaccine platform induces Th1-type immune responses and has demonstrated efficacy without immunopathology in models of respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV8, MERS-CoV10, and RSV41. SARS-CoV-2 animal challenge studies will assess INO-4800-mediated protection against disease, and vaccine-enhanced disease.

// Convergent Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Convalescent Individuals
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.092619
ref 'Robbiani_et_al_2020
  head = The observation that plasma neutralizing activity is low in most convalescent individuals, but that recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies with potent neutralizing activity can be found in individuals with unexceptional plasma neutralizing activity suggests that humans are intrinsically capable of generating anti-RBD antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Thus, vaccines that selectively and efficiently induce antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD may be especially effective.

  >>> Abstract
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21–5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 33% to below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.

There was no positive correlation between anti-RBD or -S IgG or IgM levels and duration of symptoms or the timing of sample collection relative to onset of symptoms. On the contrary, as might be expected, anti-RBD IgM titers were negatively correlated with duration of symptoms and the timing of sample collection.

Consistent with this observation, hospitalized individuals with longer symptom duration showed slightly higher average levels of neutralizing activity than non hospitalized individuals (p=0.0495). Finally, we observed a significant difference in neutralizing activity between males and females (p=0.0031). The difference between males and females was consistent with higher anti-RBD and -S IgG titers in males, and could not be attributed to age, severity, timing of sample collection relative to onset of symptoms or duration of symptoms.

  let !g self assert = The frequency of antigen-specific B cells, identified by their ability to bind to both Phycoerythrin (PE)and AF647-labeled RBD, ranged from 0.07 to 0.005% of all circulating B cells in COVID-19 convalescents but they were undetectable in pre-COVID-19 controls We obtained 534 paired IgG heavy and light chain (IGH and IGL) sequences by reverse transcription and subsequent PCR from individual RBD-binding B cells from the 6 convalescent individuals. When compared to the human antibody repertoire, several IGHV and IGLV genes were significantly over-represented.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !h self assert =  The average number of V genes nucleotide mutations for IGH and IGL was 4.2 and 2.8, respectively, which is lower than in antibodies cloned from individuals suffering from chronic infections such as Hepatitis B or HIV-1, and similar to antibodies derived from primary malaria infection or non-antigen-enriched circulating IgG memory cells. Among other antibody features, IGH CDR3 length was indistinguishable from the reported norm and hydrophobicity was below average.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = Potent neutralizing antibodies were found in individuals irrespective of their plasma NT50s. For example, C121, C144, and C135 with IC50s of 1.64, 2.55 and 2.98 ng/mL against authentic SARS144 CoV-2, respectively, were obtained from individuals COV107, COV47, and COV72 whose plasma NT50 values were of 297, 10,433 and 3,138, respectively. Finally, clones of antibodies with shared IGHV and IGLV genes were among the best neutralizers, e.g., antibody C002 composed of IGHV3-30/IGKV1-39 is shared by the 2 donors with the best plasma neutralizing activity. We conclude that even individuals with modest plasma neutralizing activity harbor rare IgG memory B cells that produce potent SARS150 CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !j self assert = The antibodies tested comprised 3 groups, all of which differ in their binding properties from CR3022, an antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV and binds to, but does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Representatives of each of the 3 groups include: C144 and C101 in Group 1; C121 and C009 in Group 2; C135 in Group 3. All of these antibodies can bind after CR3022. Groups 1 and 2 also bind after Group 3, and Groups 1 and 2 differ in that Group 1 can bind after Group 2 but not vice versa. We conclude that similar to SARS-CoV, there are multiple distinct neutralizing epitopes on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2.

  / May, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !k self assert = Consistent with the conformational flexibility of the RBD, 2D class averages showed heterogeneity in both occupancy and conformation of bound Fabs for both groups. The 3D reconstructions of S-Fab complexes revealed both a fully-occupied RBD and partial density for a second bound Fab, suggesting that Fabs from both groups are able to recognize “up” and “down” states of the RBD as previously described for some of the antibodies targeting this epitope. The 3D reconstructions are also consistent with BLI measurements indicating that Groups 1 and 2 antibodies bind a RBD epitope distinct from antibody CR3022, which is only accessible on the RBD “up” conformational state11 174 , and bind the RBD with different angles of approach, with Group 1 antibodies most similar to the approach angle of the SARS-CoV antibody S230.

ref 'Yan_et_al_2020
  head = This study has identified three indicators (LDH, hs-CRP and lymphocytes), together with a clinical route, for COVID-19 prognostic prediction. We have developed an XGBoost machine learning-based model that can predict the mortality rates of patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy, enabling detection, early intervention and potentially a reduction of mortality in patients with COVID-19.

  >>> Abstract
    The sudden increase in COVID-19 cases is putting high pressure on healthcare services worldwide. At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.

  let !a self assert = The significance of our work is twofold. First, it goes beyond providing high-risk factors. It provides a simple and intuitive clinical test to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death. Second, the three key features, LDH, lymphocytes and hs-CRP, can be easily collected in any hospital. In crowded hospitals, and with shortages of medical resources, this simple model can help to quickly prioritize patients, especially during a pandemic when limited healthcare resources have to be allocated

  let !b self assert = The increase of LDH reflects tissue/cell destruction and is regarded as a common sign of tissue/cell damage. Serum LDH has been identified as an important biomarker for the activity and severity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis11. In patients with severe pulmonary interstitial disease, the increase of LDH is significant and is one of the most important prognostic markers of lung injury11. For critically ill patients with COVID-19, the rise in LDH level indicates an increase of the activity and extent of lung injury.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Machine Intelligence
  let !c self assert = The increase of hs-CRP, an important marker for poor prognosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome, reflects a persistent state of inflammation. The result of this persistent inflammatory response is large grey-white lesions in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 (seen in autopsy). In tissue sections, a large amount of sticky secretion is also seen overflowing from the alveoli.

  / May, 2020 - Nature Machine Intelligence
  let !d self assert = Finally, our results also suggest that lymphocytes may serve as a potential therapeutic target. This hypothesis is supported by the results of clinical studies. Lymphopenia is a common feature in patients with COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality. Injured alveolar epithelial cells could induce the infiltration of lymphocytes, leading to persistent lymphopenia, as was seen in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV (they share similar alveolar penetrating and antigen presenting cell (APC) impairing pathways). A biopsy study has provided strong evidence of substantially reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated20. Also, Jing and colleagues have reported that the lymphopenia is mainly related to the decrease in CD4 and CD8 T cells21. It is thus likely that lymphocytes play distinct roles in COVID-19, which deserves further investigation.

  head = We have previously demonstrated that a common, inexpensive, and well-tolerated class of drugs called alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (⍺1-AR) antagonists can prevent hyperinflammation (“cytokine storm”) and death in mice. We here present clinical data that supports the use of ⍺1-AR antagonists in the prevention of severe complications of pneumonia, ARDS, and COVID-19. Our findings suggest that ⍺1-AR antagonists may protect from immune-mediated morbidity and mortality resulting from common lung injury and infection.

  let !a self assert = We have recently shown that CRS observed with bacterial infections, CAR-T cells, and other T cell-activating therapies is accompanied by a surge in catecholamines. Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (⍺1-AR) signaling.

  / April, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !b self assert = Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with metyrosine, a tyrosine hydroxylase antagonist, reduced levels of catecholamines and cytokine responses and resulted in markedly increased survival following various inflammatory stimuli in mice. Similar protection against a hyperinflammatory stimulus was observed with the well-tolerated ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin (but not with beta-adrenergic receptor [βAR] antagonists), demonstrating that this class of drugs can also prevent cytokine storm.

  let !c self assert = We conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 13,125 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 655 patients (5.0%) were prescribed α1-AR antagonists in the previous year. Overall, 15.9% of all patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and 8.2% both were ventilated and died in the hospital. We found that patients with prior use of ⍺1-AR antagonists had ~22% lower incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.94, p=0.015; AOR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.019). Perhaps more importantly, those patients had a ~36% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.37-1.01, p=0.074; AOR=0.59, 95% CI 0.34- 0.95, p=0.042). By contrast, prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonists was not correlated with either outcome in this cohort.

  let !d self assert = The second cohort consisted of patients admitted with pneumonia. Of the 108,956 subjects in this cohort, 5,498 patients (5.0%) were taking ⍺1-AR antagonist. Overall, 8.9% of all patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and 2.1% both were ventilated and died in the hospital. We found that patients with prior use of ⍺1-AR antagonists had ~13% lower incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.95, p=0.004; AOR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p<0.001) (Figure 1 E,F). Further, those patients had a~16% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.68-1.02, p=0.087; AOR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.014) (Figure 1 E,G). By contrast, prior use of β-AR antagonists was not correlated with either outcome in this cohort, with or without adjusting.

  let !e self assert = Prazosin is inexpensive and safe, as has been documented by long-term treatment of millions of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, and other conditions. However, all drugs can have unanticipated side effects in different clinical contexts, and the incompletely understood relationship between hypertension and COVID-19 suggests caution in using any agent that impacts blood pressure.

  >>> Abstract
    Coronavirus-19 (COVI-19) involves humans as well as animals and may cause serious damage to the respiratory tract, including the lung: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1β which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18Rα receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1β, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1β by IL-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. IL-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. IL-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by coronavirus-19, providing a new relevant strategy.

    >>> Abstract
      The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites.

Unfortunately, we missed the earlier time points of patient 1 and 3 who were directly admitted to ICU on transfer to our hospital because of severe condition, of patient 4 who had serum sample collected one day post the diagnosis of severe illness. We, fortunately, observed high serum viral load in serum within their severe illness stage.

    let !f self assert = In the anal swab cohort, we found that the presence of virus RNA in the anal digestive tract was also positively correlated with disease severity (p = 0.0102). The 3 patients detected with anal virus RNA but in mild stage should be monitored whether they will progress to the severe stage. Secondly, a high concentration of viral RNA in anal swabs suggested the digestive tract might be one extra-pulmonary site for virus replication.

    / February, 2020 - Emerging Microbes and infections
    let !g self assert = We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa. Bat originated coronavirus was found to replicate in the swine digestive tract recently, also suggesting the potential replication possibility in the human digestive tract. Nevertheless, confirmation of virus transmission through the digestive tract warrants further virus isolation from the anal swab in high safety level lab.

    / February, 2020 - Emerging Microbes and infections
    let !i self assert = We didn’t collect sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for virus detection because that the dry coughing characteristic of patients infected with 2019-nCoV prevents producing enough amount of sputum and that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection requires a sophisticated operation which increases virus exposure possibility of care providers to high concentrations of virus-containing aerosol.
