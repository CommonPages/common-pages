# Clinical and virological data, epidemic, viral load, and suspecibility to infection, first cases in Europe, France, (check the author name)
// Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30200-0
ref 'XavierLescure_et_al_2020
  head = In this paper, we report clinical and virological data on the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe, with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. Although we acknowledge the fact that the results provided are based on a small number of cases, a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy enabled us to illustrate the different courses of the disease we observed, and provide some relevant criteria regarding the severity of disease. We believe that these findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

  >>> Background
    On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.

  >>> Methods
    In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.

  >>> Findings
    The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.

  >>> Interpretations
    We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

  let !a self assert = In this case series of five patients with COVID-19, we illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution: first, mild cases through two paucisymptomatic patients aged younger than 50 years who were diagnosed early, with high viral load in nasopharyngeal samples, suggesting a significant shedding of SARS-CoV-2, reflected by virus detection by RT-PCR; second, two young patients presenting with mild symptoms at admission and experiencing a secondary progression to pneumonia and severe disease by days 10–11; and third, an older patient with a rapid evolution towards critical disease with multiple organ failure and a long and sustained persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal detection associated with viral RNA detection in multiple sites, including blood.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !b self assert = Among the five cases investigated here, the two patients with mild disease were diagnosed at an early stage of the disease because they had a contact with a confirmed case. High viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are suggestive of potentially high risk of transmissibility during the very first days of symptoms. This finding is in line with data reported by Zou and colleagues, who analysed viral load in the upper respiratory tract in relation to day of onset of symptoms in 17 symptomatic patients in whom higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset. This observation suggests that the virus shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from that seen with SARS-CoV, in which the virus load was very low at disease onset

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !c self assert = In two of five patients reported here, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples. This possible route of transmission must be investigated; detection of viral RNA does not necessarily imply that infectious particles are present and transmissible,20 particularly when patients, such as these two individuals, have no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !d self assert = In this case series, three patients had a severe or critical disease with two different patterns. The first one, in patients with severe diseases (patients 1 and 2), is characterised by a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed with a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples: SARS-CoV-2 was no longer detected in the upper respiratory tract in one patient and at very low levels in the other. In patients with this pattern, a CT scan at the moment of the worsening showed ground-glass lung opacities, in line with those reported by others in patients with COVID-19. Time to worsening of respiratory symptoms was around 10 days after disease onset in these two cases, close to the median disease duration before worsening (8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !e self assert = In this case series, except for the patient with critical disease, the viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and day 14. Of note, the virus was also detected by rtRT-PCR at low levels in the upper respiratory tract, even after full resolution of symptoms. Whether infectious virus might be still present despite symptom resolution will require further attempts of virus isolation.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !f self assert = In these patients, one might postulate that the lung damage is more related to immunopathological lesions, resulting from an excessive pro-inflammatory host response, rather than to uncontrolled viral replication. Of note, we did not assess virus load in low respiratory tract samples from these two patients.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !g self assert = The second pattern, observed in the patient classified as having critical disease and who died (patient 3), consists of a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with positive virus detection by rtRT-PCR in other body fluids, including blood. By contrast with the previous pattern, this persistent high viral load suggests the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to evade the immune response.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !h self assert = Indeed, the 80-year-old patient, unlike the other cases, had evidence of high viral replication in the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract, with virus detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid. The impaired immune response might have facilitated the bacterial and fungal superinfections. Patient 3 was aged 80 years and might have had an impaired interferon pathway.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !i self assert = These different patterns, and especially the fact that patients with severe or critical disease might have different viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract, might be important.The findings suggest that different therapeutic approaches, based on viral kinetics monitoring, might be needed in patients with a virus load decrease in the upper respiratory tract versus those with high viral replication and systemic virus dissemination. We should be cautious when analysing these data because of the small number of patients, but adapting treatment to the clinical course should be considered in future studies.

  / March, 2020 - The Lancet
  let !j self assert = We considered remdesivir use in the three patients with severe disease patterns. On the basis of our data, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of remdesivir on COVID-19 infections. In two patients, the drug was initiated at the time of disease worsening, when the virus was already barely detectable in the clinical specimens. In one of them, remdesivir was discontinued after 5 days because of a combined alanine aminotransferase elevation and a rash, although it could not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to remdesivir. In the third patient, remdesivir was discontinued after a single dose because of renal replacement therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation. Remdesivir contains cyclodextrin, an excipient whose clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance. Because the patients condition was worsening and viral load was not decreasing, we reinitiated remdesivir.

// Association of HLA class I with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection
doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9
ref 'Lin_et_al_2003
  head = While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.

  >>> Background
    The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection.

  >>> Methods
    HLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190 normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis.

  >>> Results
    Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a "severe cases" patient group from the infected "probable SARS" patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc = 0.0279).

  >>> Conclusions
    Densely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.

On the contrary, the frequency of HLA-B* 4601 in the five severe cases was slightly increased when compared to the 28 excluded fever patients (P = 0.007, Pc = ns), but the difference was clearly significant when compared to control A (P = 0.0008, Pc = 0.03).

Interestingly, HLA-B* 4601/B46 is also seldom seen in Europeans populations where very few cases of SARS infection of individuals of European origin were reported

// HLA Class I Alleles Are Associated with Peptide-Binding Repertoires of Different Size, Affinity, and Immunogenicity
doi: https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1302101
ref 'Paul_et_al_2013
  head = In this study, our data shows that different HLA class I alleles are associated with different peptide-binding repertoire sizes, defined as the fraction of all possible peptides that are bound at a given affinity threshold and sheds new light on the mechanisms governing allelic polymorphism of MHC molecules. We investigated the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. Although no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than are HLA A alleles. We predict that this enhanced understanding will further increase the accuracy and ease of prediction of MHC-restricted T cell epitopes.

  >>> Abstract
    Prediction of HLA binding affinity is widely used to identify candidate T cell epitopes, and an affinity of 500 nM is routinely used as a threshold for peptide selection. However, the fraction (percentage) of peptides predicted to bind with affinities of 500 nM varies by allele. For example, of a large collection of ∼30,000 dengue virus–derived peptides only 0.3% were predicted to bind HLA A*0101, wheras nearly 5% were predicted for A*0201. This striking difference could not be ascribed to variation in accuracy of the algorithms used, as predicted values closely correlated with affinity measured in vitro with purified HLA molecules. These data raised the question whether different alleles would also vary in terms of epitope repertoire size, defined as the number of associated epitopes or, alternatively, whether alleles vary drastically in terms of the affinity threshold associated with immunogenicity. To address this issue, strains of HLA transgenic mice with wide (A*0201), intermediate (B*0702), or narrow (A*0101) repertoires were immunized with peptides of varying binding affinity and relative percentile ranking. The results show that absolute binding capacity is a better predictor of immunogenicity, and analysis of epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database revealed that predictive efficacy is increased using allele-specific affinity thresholds. Finally, we investigated the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. Although no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than are HLA A alleles.

  let !a self assert = Our analysis demonstrates that the breadth of repertoire and associated epitope affinities is likely influenced by the structure of the HLA molecule, as differences are apparent between the HLA A and B loci.It is generally assumed that pathogen escape is a major driver of evolution of HLA polymorphism. In this regard, it is reasonable to hypothesize that repertoire size and average epitope affinity should be considered as broad variables potentially influencing HLA evolution at the immunogenetic and immunochemical level.

  / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
  let !b self assert = It is noteworthy that similar variation in repertoire size was recently noted in the case of the class I molecules expressed by the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) (55). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that similar allele-related variation in repertoire size will be broadly observed. Future studies will address this point by combined immunological and bioinformatics analyses.

  / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
  let !c self assert = A theoretical point of potential interest is whether the presence within a species or a population of different MHC allelic variants associated with different repertoire sizes might confer some advantage and be optimal in terms of overall biological function of the MHC system. A wide repertoire will render pathogen escape by loss of MHC binding less likely, but alternatively it might dilute the focus of the immune response, be more likely to trigger autoimmunity, or even paradoxically result in a too narrow T cell repertoire because of overzealous negative selection.

  / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
  let !d self assert = Note, too, that in evolutionary terms, HLA B polymorphism is more recent, more diverse, and more rapidly evolving. Thus, in a broad sense, HLA A seems, on average, to be associated with a broader repertoire approach than does HLA B, which seems to be enacting a strategy based on somewhat narrower but more flexible and diverse repertoires and binding motifs. Indeed, most examples of HLA class I molecules associated with disease resistance to viral infections, such as HIV or DENV, are HLA B.

  / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
  let !e self assert = First, our data indicate that when a single criterion for alleles has to be chosen, it is preferable to use absolute binding affinity, rather than a relative percentile. Second, the data indicate that 500 nM is a reasonably good “universal” threshold. Third, our data indicate that more effective allele-specific thresholds can be derived either experimentally or by linear regression equations as the one shown in Fig. 4 and Supplemental Table I.

  / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
  let !f self assert = In this case, our data indicate that the number of peptides necessary to predict a similar fraction of epitopes will vary as a function of the particular allele considered, and thus the optimal prediction strategy can be adapted to the specific experimental goal.

  >>> Summary
    Following their discovery in the early 1970s, classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been the prototypical candidates for genetic susceptibility to infectious disease. Indeed, the original hypothesis for the extreme variability observed at HLA loci (H-2 in mice) was the major selective pressure from infectious diseases. Now that both the human genome and the molecular basis of innate and acquired immunity are understood in greater detail, do the classical HLA loci still stand out as major genes that determine susceptibility to infectious disease? This review looks afresh at the evidence supporting a role for classical HLA loci in susceptibility to infectious disease, examines the limitations of data reported to date, and discusses current advances in methodology and technology that will potentially lead to greater understanding of their role in infectious diseases in the future.

// Human leukocyte antigen susceptibility map for SARS-CoV-2
doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00510-20
ref 'Nguyen_et_al_2020
  head = We found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS. Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic. Based on our study, we think variation in HLA genes is part of the explanation for the huge differences in infection severity in many COVID-19 patients. These differences in the HLA genes are probably not the only genetic factor that affects severity of COVID-19, but they may be a significant piece of the puzzle.

  >>> Abstract
    Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [lsqb]HLA[rsqb] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (Lin M, Tseng H-K, Trejaut JA, Lee H-L, Loo J-H, Chu C-C, Chen P-J, Su Y-W, Lim KH, Tsai Z-U, Lin R-Y, Lin R-S, Huang C-H. BMC Med Genet 4:9. 2003.). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.

  >>> Importance
    Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of viral severity in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.

Conversely, we note that 56 different HLA alleles demonstrated no appreciable 124 binding affinity (<500nM) to any of the conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides, suggesting a 125 concomitant lack of potential for cross-protective immunity from other human coronaviruses. We note, in particular, HLA-B*46:01 is among these alleles.

We found that in general, there is no correlation between the HLA allelic frequency in the population and allelic capacity to bind SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 peptides, irrespective of estimated timing of peptide production during the viral replication cycle.

It is important to further study how HLA types can clinically affect COVID-19 severity and to test these predictions using real cases. Understanding how variation in HLA types may affect the clinical course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease.

ref 'Asadi_et_al_2019
  head = This paper shows that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as “speech superemitters,” consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.

  >>> Abstract
    Mechanistic hypotheses about airborne infectious disease transmission have traditionally emphasized the role of coughing and sneezing, which are dramatic expiratory events that yield both easily visible droplets and large quantities of particles too small to see by eye. Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as “speech superemitters,” consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.

  let !a self assert = Our results indicate that speech is potentially of much greater concern than breathing for two reasons: the particles on average are larger, and thus could potentially carry a larger number of pathogens, and much greater quantities of particles are emitted compared to breathing, thus increasing the odds of infecting nearby susceptible individuals.

  let !b self assert = Although the particle emission rate increased with amplitude, the size distribution of the particles was not affected significantly, with the geometric mean particle diameter remaining near 1 μm regardless of voice amplitude. Because the particle size remains similar regardless of amplitude, the increased particle counts  indicate that the total volume of emitted respiratory fluid (i.e., the proteinaceous liquid droplets aerosolized from the serous and mucoid layers lining the respiratory tract) increases considerably with the vocalization loudness.

Coupled with the observation that the particles generated during speech on average are slightly larger, the results suggest that laryngeal particle generation, which presumably does not occur during normal breathing, is at least partially responsible for the observed larger rates of particle emission.

In other words, although half of the participants emitted fewer than 3 particles per second, a small fraction of individuals (8 out of 40) emitted considerably more.

ref 'Hebert-Dufresne_et_al_2020
  head = This paper reiterates that when accounting for the full distribution of secondary cases caused by an infected individual, there is no direct relationship between R0 and the size of an outbreak. We also stress that both R0 and the full secondary case distribution are not properties of the disease itself, but are instead set by properties of the pathogen, the host population and the context of the outbreak. Nevertheless, we provide a straightforward methodology for translating estimates of transmission heterogeneity into epidemic forecasts. Altogether, predicting outbreak size based on early data is an incredibly complex challenge but one that is increasingly within reach due to new mathematical analyses and faster communication of public health data.

  >>> Abstract
    The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory (Newman2001) that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. %, in the case of COVID-19 from 10-70\% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.

Clearly, once interventions are put in place and/or substantial behavioral change occurs, all methods that do not account for these effects will over-estimate the total outbreak size. Nevertheless, our approach provides a much more reasoned estimate of the total risk to any given population, and predictions very close to the most recent seropositivity estimates for the COVID-19 outbreak in a German Municipality and in obstetrical patients presenting for delivery, as well as for SARS among wild animal handlers (other smaller estimates correspond to health-care workers)

Comparing the output of agent-based simulations with reported incidence can be used to effectively sample a joint posterior distribution over R0 and dispersion parameter k.

Instead, they only need to be run over enough early data to infer the parameter estimates that are then fed into our network model to compute the final outbreak size.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !h self assert = As for COVID-19, how the width of the confidence interval on our prediction for the final outbreak size mostly stems from uncertainty in the heterogeneity of secondary infections; i.e., the dispersion parameter k. With limited heterogeneity, our predictions would have been closer to classic mass-action forecasts and the current pandemic of COVID-19 would likely have been a consequence of not only R0, but of the homogeneity of secondary infections: each new cases steadily leading to additional infections. Thankfully, with recent large estimates for its heterogeneity, the observed transmission could be mostly maintained by so-called “super-spreading events”, which could be easier to manage with contact tracing, screening and infection control.



# heterogenity in host susceptibility, model, underscoring the importance of heterogeneity in infectious disease systems, Heterogeneity in susceptibility is a key determinant of disease dynamics and impacts

doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00796-17
ref 'Langwig_et_al_2017
  head = Our data emphasize the importance of incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility in estimates of control measure efficacy. Inclusion of this variance will help to improve prediction and allow for better management of infectious diseases of humans and wildlife.

  >>> Abstract
    Heterogeneity in host susceptibility is a key determinant of infectious disease dynamics but is rarely accounted for in assessment of disease control measures. Understanding how susceptibility is distributed in populations, and how control measures change this distribution, is integral to predicting the course of epidemics with and without interventions. Using multiple experimental and modeling approaches, we show that rainbow trout have relatively homogeneous susceptibility to infection with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus and that vaccination increases heterogeneity in susceptibility in a nearly all-or-nothing fashion. In a simple transmission model with an R0 of 2, the highly heterogeneous vaccine protection would cause a 35 percentage-point reduction in outbreak size over an intervention inducing homogenous protection at the same mean level. More broadly, these findings provide validation of methodology that can help to reduce biases in predictions of vaccine impact in natural settings and provide insight into how vaccination shapes population susceptibility.

  >>> Importance
    Differences among individuals influence transmission and spread of infectious diseases as well as the effectiveness of control measures. Control measures, such as vaccines, may provide leaky protection, protecting all hosts to an identical degree, or all-or-nothing protection, protecting some hosts completely while leaving others completely unprotected. This distinction can have a dramatic influence on disease dynamics, yet this distribution of protection is frequently unaccounted for in epidemiological models and estimates of vaccine efficacy. Here, we apply new methodology to experimentally examine host heterogeneity in susceptibility and mode of vaccine action as distinct components influencing disease outcome. Through multiple experiments and new modeling approaches, we show that the distribution of vaccine effects can be robustly estimated. These results offer new experimental and inferential methodology that can improve predictions of vaccine effectiveness and have broad applicability to human, wildlife, and ecosystem health.

  let !b self assert = Heterogeneity in infectiousness can modify disease dynamics, but importantly must be correlated with susceptibility, contacts, or other parameters (e.g., mortality from disease) to influence the size of epidemics. This is because the mean of the distribution will be identical among infected cohorts unless other model parameters preferentially remove or add individuals that change this mean (e.g., individuals that are more infectious die before they transmit).

  / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
  let !c self assert = Conversely, like heterogeneity in susceptibility, heterogeneity in contacts will change dynamically over an epidemic as the individuals with the highest numbers of contacts become infected early in the epidemic and continue to infect others during their infectious period but then exit the infected pool as they recover (for pathogens with a recovered class). Therefore, adding heterogeneity in the encounter rate should further reduce the size of outbreaks, dependent on correlations between model parameters and the relative importance of each host trait in determining infection and mortality.

  let !d self assert = Excluding heterogeneity in susceptibility from epidemic models had a significant impact on disease dynamics. Using a polarized mode of vaccine action resulted in fewer infected individuals under a wide range of R0 values, whereas homogeneous protection led to all hosts becoming infected for R0 values of 6. While the fraction of hosts infected will depend on particular parameter estimates, and we have not exhausted all parameter combinations and shape possibilities, this study provides further evidence that heterogeneous susceptibility decreases the size of epidemics. This is because the polarized mode of vaccine action greatly reduced the susceptibility of a fraction of individuals, nearly completely protecting them against infection.

  / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
  let !e self assert = Transitions of susceptible individuals into the infected class occurred nonuniformly, with the most susceptible individuals first becoming infected, leaving increasingly resistant individuals in the susceptible class as the epidemic progressed. Conversely, the homogeneous model assumed that the susceptibility of all individuals was identical and therefore did not allow for the effect of cohort selection.The discrete all-or-nothing model overestimated vaccine protection compared to the experimentally derived distribution of vaccine protection. This further emphasizes that empirical estimates of vaccine protection can vastly improve epidemiological predictions and provide insight into vaccine programs.

If selection is strongly directional and uncorrelated with other traits, susceptibility to a specific pathogen would be predicted to decrease and become more homogeneous over time, just as mean susceptibility decreases over the course of an epidemic

ref 'Ferrari_et_al_2006
  head = The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.

  >>> Abstract
    The spread of infectious disease through communities depends fundamentally on the underlying patterns of contacts between individuals. Generally, the more contacts one individual has, the more vulnerable they are to infection during an epidemic. Thus, outbreaks disproportionately impact the most highly connected demographics. Epidemics can then lead, through immunization or removal of individuals, to sparser networks that are more resistant to future transmission of a given disease. Using several classes of contact networks—Poisson, scale-free and small-world—we characterize the structural evolution of a network due to an epidemic in terms of frailty (the degree to which highly connected individuals are more vulnerable to infection) and interference (the extent to which the epidemic cuts off connectivity among the susceptible population that remains following an epidemic). The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.

    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2–2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period. We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9).

ref 'Britton_et_al_2020

Our illustration indicates a reduction from 60% down to 43% (assuming R0 = 2.5) but this should be interpreted as an illustration, rather than an exact value or even a best estimate.

  >>> Abstract
    Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level hC is defined as hC=1-1/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level hD, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than hC. As an illustration we show that if R0=2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is hD=43% rather than hC=1-1/2.5=60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

However, more complex and realistic models have many other types of heterogeneities: for instance increased spreading within households (of different sizes) or within schools and workplaces; and spatial aspects with rural areas having lower contact rates than metropolitan regions.It seems reasonable to assume that most such additional heterogeneities will have the effect of lowering the disease-induced immunity level hDS even further, in that high spreading environments (metropolitan regions, large households, big workplaces, ...) will have a higher fraction infected thus resulting in immunity being concentrated even more on highly active individuals. Some complex models do not categorize individuals into different activity levels, or the related feature in an underlying social network with varying numberof acquaintances.

// Individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 lowers the herd immunity threshold

ref 'Gomes_et_al_2020
  head = This paper demonstrates that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure (connectivity) accelerates the acquisition of immunity in populations. More susceptible and more connected individuals have a higher propensity to be infected and thus are likely to become immune earlier. Due to this selective immunisation, heterogeneous populations require less infections to cross their herd immunity thresholds than homogeneous (or not sufficiently heterogeneous) models would suggest. We integrate continuous distributions of susceptibility or connectivity in otherwise basic epidemic models for COVID-19 and show that as the coefficient of variation increases from 0 to 4, the herd immunity threshold declines from over 60% to less than 10%. Measures of individual variation are urgently needed to narrow the estimated ranges of herd immunity thresholds and plan accordingly.

  >>> Abstract
    As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the incidence of new cases to decline. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

  let !a self assert = Individual variation in risk of acquiring infection is under selection by the force of infection, whether individual differences are due to biological susceptibility, physical exposure, or a combination of the two traits. Selection results in the removal of the most at-risk individuals from the susceptible pool as they become infected and eventually recover (some die). This selective acquisition of infection and immunity results simultaneously in decelerated epidemic growth and accelerated induction of immunity in the population.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !b self assert = In idealised scenarios of vaccines delivered at random and individuals mixing at random, herd immunity thresholds are given by a simple formula (1 − 1⁄R0!) which, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, suggests that 60-70% of the population should be immunised to halt spread considering estimates of R0! between 2.5 and 3. A crucial caveat in exporting these calculations to immunization by natural infection, is that natural infection does not occur at random.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !c self assert = Individuals who are more susceptible or more exposed are more prone to be infected and become immune earlier, which lowers the threshold. The herd immunity threshold declines sharply when coefficients of variation increase from 0 to 2 and remains below 20% for more variable populations.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !d self assert = We searched the literature or estimates of individual variation in propensity to acquire or transmit COVID-19 or other infectious diseases and overlaid the findings as vertical lines in Figure 3. Most CV estimates are comprised between 2 and 4, a range where naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may place populations over the herd immunity threshold once as few as 10-20% of its individuals are immune. This depends, however, on which specific transmission traits are variable.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !e self assert = Heterogeneity in the transmission of respiratory infections has traditionally focused on variation in exposure summarised into age-structured contact matrices. Besides overlooking differences in susceptibility given exposure, the aggregation of individuals into age groups curtails coefficients of variation with important downstream implications. Popular models based on contact matrices use a coefficient of variation around 0.9 and perform similarly to our scenarios for CV = 1. Supported by existing estimates across infectious diseases, we argue that CV is generally higher and prognostics more optimistic than currently assumed. However plausible, this needs to be confirmed for the current COVID-19 pandemic and, given its relevance to policy decisions, it should be set as a priority

  let !f self assert = Variation in infectiousness was critical to attribute the scarce and explosive outbreaks to superspreaders when the SARS-CoV-1 emerged in 2002, but infectiousness does not respond to selection as susceptibility or exposure do. Models with or without individual variation in infectiousness perform equivalently when implemented deterministically and only differ due to stochasticity in an entirely different phenomenon to that presented in this paper. Among the estimates of individual variation plotted in Figure 3, those corresponding to SARS-CoV viruses have been described as variation in individual infectiousness, but the way authors describe superspreaders is suggestive that higher infectiousness stems from higher connectivity with other individuals, who may be susceptible displayed in Figure 2, with CV = 3 for exposure to infection.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !g self assert = Interventions themselves have potential to manipulate individual variation.Current social distancing measures may be argued to either increase or decrease variation in exposure, depending on the compliance of highly-susceptible or highly-connected individuals in relation to the average. A deep understanding of these patterns is crucial not only to develop more accurate predictive models, but also to refine control strategies and to interpret data resulting from ongoing serological surveys

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !h self assert = Most CV estimates are  comprised between 2 and 4, a range where naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may place populations over the herd immunity threshold once as few as 10-20% of its individuals are immune. This depends, however, on which specific transmission traits are variable.

  / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !i self assert = On the one hand, if CV is very low, the most stringent control measures would need to be continued for suppression of the epidemic. The other side of that coin is a scenario where keeping only the mildest control measures (protecting the elderly to reduce mortality rates) is optimal. It would therefore be imperative to conduct longitudinal serological studies in representative samples of the population, as control measures are relaxed. Given a percent positivity in an initial survey, the speed at which that figure increases after control measures are eased would reveal what the most likely value of CV is, and simultaneously advise which control measures should be enforced.

// Clinical presentation and virological assessment of hospitalized cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in a travel-associated transmission cluster
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502
ref 'Woelfel_et_al_2020
  head = The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.

  >>> Abstract
    Background: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.

  let !b self assert = Also, viral load differed considerably. In SARS, it took 7 to 10 days after onset until peak RNA concentrations (of up to 5x105 copies per swab) were reached. In the present study, peak concentrations were reached before day 5, and were more than 1000 times higher. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !c self assert = Successful live virus isolation from throat swabs is another striking difference from SARS, for which such isolation was rarely successful. Altogether, this suggests active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues, where only minimal ACE-2 expression is found and SARS-CoV is therefore not thought to replicate.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !d self assert = Whereas proof of replication by histopathology is awaited, extended tissue tropism of SARSCoV-2 with replication in the throat is strongly supported by our studies of sgRNAtranscribing cells in throat swab samples, particularly during the first 5 days of symptoms. Striking additional evidence for independent replication in the throat is provided by sequence findings in one patient who consistently showed a distinct virus in her throat as opposed to the lung.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !e self assert = The majority of patients in the present study seemed to be already beyond their shedding peak in upper respiratory tract samples when first tested, while shedding of infectious virus in sputum continued through the first week of symptoms. Together, these findings suggest a more efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV through active pharyngeal viral shedding at a time when symptoms are still mild and typical of upper respiratory tract infection.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !f self assert = Later in the disease, COVID-19 then resembles SARS in terms of replication in the lower respiratory tract. Of note, the two patients who showed some symptoms of lung affection showed a prolonged viral load in sputum. Studies should look at the prognostic value of an increase of viral load beyond the end of week 1, potentially indicating aggravation of symptoms.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !g self assert = One of the most interesting hypotheses to explain a potential extension of tropism to the throat is the presence of a polybasic furin-type cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is not present in SARS-CoV.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !h self assert = The combination of very high virus RNA concentrations and occasional detection of sgRNAcontaining cells in stool indicate active replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Active replication is also suggested by a much higher detection rate as compared to MERScoronavirus, for which we found stool-associated RNA in only 14.6% samples in 37 patients hospitalized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !i self assert = Our failure to isolate live SARS-CoV-2 from stool may be due to the mild courses of cases, with only one case showing intermittent diarrhea. In China, diarrhea has been seen in only 2 of 99 cases. Further studies should therefore address whether SARS-CoV-2 shed in stool is rendered non-infectious though contact with the gut environment.

  let !j self assert = Our initial results suggest that measures to contain viral spread should aim at droplet-, rather than fomitebased transmission.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !k self assert = Based on the present findings, early discharge with ensuing home isolation could be chosen for patients who are beyond day 10 of symptoms with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies per ml of sputum. Both criteria predict that there is little residual risk of infectivity, based on cell culture.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !l self assert = The serological courses of all patients suggest a timing of seroconversion similar to or slightly earlier than in SARS-CoV infection. Seroconversion in most cases of SARS occurred during the second week of symptoms. As in SARS and MERS, IgM was not detected significantly earlier than IgG in immunofluorescence, which might in part be due to technical reasons as the higher avidity of IgG antibodies outcompetes IgM for viral epitopes in the assay. IgG depletion can only partially alleviate this effect.

  / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !m self assert = When aligned to viral load courses, it seems there is no abrupt virus elimination at the time of seroconversion. Rather, seroconversion early in week 2 coincides with a slow but steady decline of sputum viral load. Whether certain properties such as glycosylation pattern at critical sites of the glycoprotein play a role in the attenuation of neutralizing antibody response needs further clarification. In any case, vaccine approaches targeting mainly the induction of antibody responses should aim to induce particularly strong antibody responses in order to be effective.

ref 'Bastier_et_al_2015
  head = Large-volume irrigation provides good distribution over the sinonasal cavities as a whole; and a stable, reproducible isotonic solution with slightly alkaline pH and a composition close to that of seawater optimizes trophic and functional recovery of the respiratory epithelium.

  >>> Abstract
    Nasal irrigation plays a non-negligible role in the treatment of numerous sinonasal pathologies and postoperative care. There is, however, a wide variety of protocols. The present review of the evidence-based literature sought objective arguments for optimization and efficacy. It emerged that large-volume low-pressure nasal douche optimizes the distribution and cleansing power of the irrigation solution in the nasal cavity. Ionic composition and pH also influence mucociliary clearance and epithelium trophicity. Seawater is less rich in sodium ions and richer in bicarbonates, potassium, calcium and magnesium than is isotonic normal saline, while alkaline pH and elevated calcium concentration optimized ciliary motility in vitro. Bicarbonates reduce secretion viscosity. Potassium and magnesium promote healing and limit local inflammation. These results show that the efficacy of nasal irrigation is multifactorial. Large-volume low-pressure nasal irrigation using undiluted seawater seems, in the present state of knowledge, to be the most effective protocol.

In humans, solutions with acidic pH likewise reduced ciliary beat frequency, while slightly alkaline solutions enhanced it. In vivo, on the other hand, in humans, pH impact on mucociliary clearance is more difficult to ascertain. England et al. found no statistical correlation between pH and mucociliary clearance in healthy non-smokers

  let !d self assert = However, change in mucociliary clearance seems not to depend exclusively on pH: in vitro, in chicken embryo tracheal explants, hypertonic (1.5%) and hypotonic (0.45%) irrigation both reduced ciliary beat frequency as compared to physiological (0.9%) saline. Beat arrest was irreversible with a 14% solution, and hypertonicity triggered mucus hypersecretion and increased the permeability of tight junctions. These data correlated in vivo with increased secretion and exudation in response to hypertonic solutions. Paradoxically, other authors reported improved in vivo mucociliary clearance on saccharine test in healthy subjects with hypertonic solutions between 3% and 5%.

It also demonstrated that irrigation reduced number of episodes, ENT complications and medication (antipyretics, antibiotics, mucolytics and decongestants) in children suffering from frequent rhinitis. The second, single-center, study of 69 children with acute sinusitis, found that standard treatment (antibiotics, mucolytics and local nasal decongestants) reduced symptoms more effectively when associated to nasal irrigation with an isotonic solution.

During normal operation, the airplane ventilation system was designed to completely exchange the air in the passenger compartment, a volume of 3 m3, every four and one-half minutes. The airflow from ceiling to floor was laminar, with little fore-to-aft turbulence between rows. However, following engine failure, the ventilation system was turned off and the doors were kept closed for approximately two hours. Later, when the front cargo and rear passenger compartment doors were opened, most passengers felt that the compartment was comfortable or warm although the outside temperature was 1.7 C (29 F), suggesting that there was poor air exchange even during this period.

Moreover, this attack rate varied by groups of persons on board; e.g. crew, 40 per cent; Anchorage boarding passengers, 58 per cent; and Homer boarding passengers, 83 per cent. Among these groups, those with higher attack rates were again the persons who had been on the airplane longer. The high clinical attack rate among passengers aboard the aircraft was probably the result of their exposure to large aerosols of droplets produced by an ill passenger in a confined, stagnant and dry airspace.

# SARS, Aircraft transmission,
// Transmission of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on Aircraft
doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa031349
ref 'Olsen_et_al_2003
  head = Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

  >>> Background
    The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.

  >>> Methods
    We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.

  >>> Results
    After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

  >>> Conclusions
    Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

  let !a self assert = Among the 22 patients with SARS, the date of onset of illness ranged from March 17 to March 23, a mean of four days after the flight (range, two to eight) and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. A total of five persons died as a result of their illness (three persons from Hong Kong, one from China, and one from Singapore).

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !b self assert = The risk of illness was related to the proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 passegers who were seated in the same row as the patient or in the three rows in front of him, as compared with 10 of the 88 passengers who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). It is notable that 56 percent of the passengers who became infected were not seated in the same row as the index patient or in the three rows in front of him.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !c self assert = The observation that the passengers who became infected were clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft, is consistent with the pattern described in other cases in which a respiratory pathogen was transmitted on board an aircraft and lends further plausibility to the theory that transmission occurred during the flight.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !d self assert = The distance covered by three economy-class rows on a Boeing 737-300 is 2.3 m (90 in.). On this aircraft, 90 percent of the persons who became ill were seated more than 36 in. away from the index patient, so airborne, small-particle, or other remote transmission may be more straightforward explanations for the observed distribution of cases.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !e self assert = There was no significant difference in risk between persons seated in an aisle seat and those seated in a middle or window seat (6 of 39 [15 percent] vs. 12 of 72 [17 percent]; relative risk, 0.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 2.3). Hand contact might have been expected to increase the risk among passengers who sat in aisle seats, but we did not find such a pattern. Two of the 20 passengers who became infected (and whose seating assignments are known) were seated within 0.9 m (36 in.) of the index patient.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !f self assert = As was expected on the basis of the known patterns of transmission of SARS, the fact that the virus appeared to be transmitted by passengers who were in the symptomatic phase of illness but not by those who were in the presymptomatic phase suggests that the risk of transmission varies according to the phase of illness. It is likely that persons who fly during the incubation period (within 10 days before the onset of illness) pose very little or no risk to other passengers. However, we might have missed some cases because of the low percentage of passengers from Flight 1 who were contacted and because of the limitations in routine surveillance.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !g self assert = As in our findings with regard to Flights 2 and 3, the risk of transmission can vary widely. The variation in risk might be influenced by the duration of the flight, the stage of illness, the type of air-ventilation system in use, the size of the aircraft, and the number of infected persons on board. In addition, some investigators have proposed that poorly characterized host factors in certain patients predispose them to transmit the virus to large numbers of persons (making them so-called “super-spreaders”), a hypothesis that has been used to explain epidemiologic clustering in Hong Kong and Singapore and that might be applicable to the index patient on Flight 2

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !h self assert = It is important to emphasize that the true attack rate on Flight 2 may be different from the rate we calculated. Sixteen of the 22 cases that resulted from this flight had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV. No specimens were available for testing from five patients, and one patient had a negative test; some patients who were deemed to have probable cases of SARS may not have been infected with SARS-CoV.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !i self assert = On the other hand, five of the cases resulted in death, and the other patients had illness compatible with a diagnosis of SARS whose onset occurred within the expected incubation period. Forty-six of the passengers who were considered not to have been infected were not interviewed, including the two who sat next to the index patient, and it is possible that routine surveillance missed some additional infections.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !j self assert = The fact that only 45 percent of the passengers were interviewed despite intensive investigation by three health departments over the course of two months highlights the difficulties faced by such investigations and raises the possibility that more transmission occurred than was recognized.

  / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !k self assert = In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

ref 'Hamburger_et_al_1948
  head = Although sneezing probably accounts for a certain number of sporadic cases of hemolytic streptococcal infection, it is not, in our opinion, important in epidemics because (1) it is not a common symptom and (2) very few sneezes discharge significant numbers of beta hemolytic streptococci into the air as droplet nuclei. The rare carriers whose sneezes heavily contaminate the air may be very dangerous if they do not baffle the sneezes efficiently. Since the material atomized in a sneeze is saliva, these individuals represent a type of dangerous carrier whose nose culture may be negative.  whose nose culture may be negative. Coughing, likewise, is important only in sporadic infections for similar reasons. This symptom is more common than sneezing. Talking expels negligible numbers of hemolytic streptococci.

  let !a self assert = The material dispersed into the air during a sneeze is chiefly saliva.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !b self assert = Four dispersion patterns of beta hemolytic streptococci by sneezing were evident. In the most common, moderate numbers were expelled in large droplets which fell rapidly to the floor 1.5 feet from the sneezer, but very few or none in droplet nuclei. In one of two less common patterns, small numbers of beta streptococci were sneezed as droplet nuclei but none in large droplets; in the other, no beta streptococci were recovered from the air. In the rarest, of which only one example was found, large numbers of beta (and alpha) streptococci were expelled both as droplet nuclei and in large droplets; many were collected as far as 9.5 feet from the sneezer. The saliva of this carrier contained huge numbers of beta streptococci. Thirty-five per cent of twenty carriers sneezed out large numbers of alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei. Eighty per cent discharged moderate or large numbers in heavy droplets which fell rapidly to the floor.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !c self assert = Thirty-five per cent of twenty carriers sneezed out large numbers of alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei. Eighty per cent discharged moderate or large numbers in heavy droplets which fell rapidly to the floor.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !d self assert = In the most common pattern (65 per cent of the subjects) few or no beta streptococci were discharged as droplet nuclei, but many were expelled in large droplets captured by the settling plate on the floor 1 1/2 feet from the subject. Fewer than 10 per cent of these large droplets traveled as far as 5 1/2 feet. In a less common pattern, 10 per cent of the subjects, small numbers of droplet nuclei contained beta streptococci but none were collected in large droplets failing on the settling plates. In 20 per cent of the subjects, few or no beta streptococci were recovered at all.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !e self assert = Only one carrier, No. 20, sneezed large numbers of beta streptococci (and also alpha streptococci), both as droplet nuclei and in large droplets falling on all three settling plates. That this subject was really an unusually good atomizer was shown by a second test performed six days after the first. In these two tests he expelled an average of nine beta streptococci per cubic foot per sneeze as droplet nuclei fairly evenly distributed among the three bubblers. In the third experiment the following week his between the sneeze patterns of alpha and output diminished.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !f self assert = Alpha Streptococci and “ Total Bacteria.” In addition to the, beta streptococci, greenforming colonies (salivary streptococci) were usually counted in the pour plates made from bubbler air samples as were the total number of colonies (exclusive of beta streptococci) on the gentian violet blood agar plates exposed on the floor. The numbers of these non-pathogens recovered from the air are presented in  was common, occurring in 35 per cent ofthe subjects. Most of the remaining 65 per cent expelled few or no alphas as dropletnuclei but significant numbers in large droplets. Thus the common and rare patterns but not the less common patternsof beta streptococcus expulsion were reproduced by alpha streptococci.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !g self assert = Of even greater importance is the relative number of bacteria expelled in tiny droplet nuclei as compared with rapidly falling droplets. The fact that 35 per cent of the carriers in this series sneezed large numbersof alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei indicates that expulsion of these tiny nuclei by sneezing is a frequent occurrence.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !h self assert = Uniformity of Distribution of Droplet Nuclei Sneezed into the Experimental Room. Nearly as many droplet nuclei were recovered 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 feet from the sneezer as 1 1/2 feet away. This distribution was in striking contrast with that of the larger droplets, 90 percent of which travelled only 1 1/2 feet.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !i self assert = Persistence of Alpha and Beta Streptococci in air after Sneezing. First, approximately 50 per cent of the number of streptococci collected during sneezing still remained suspended in the air ten to sixteen minutes. Air cultures made in one experiment thirty minutes after the first sneeze, revealed only 5 per cent left. Our findings are in general agreement with those of Bourdillon, Lidwell and Lovelock, who noted that of the total number of air-borne bacteria recovered during the first minute after sneezing, 32 per cent were present fifteen minutes later.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !j self assert = The second point of interest is the sharp change in the distribution of the streptococci on the three settling plates ten to sixteen minutes after sneezing as compared with the sneezing period. During sneezing, about ten times as many streptococci were collected in the nearest settling plate as in either of the other two whereas the three plates exposed ten to sixteen minutes after sneezing recovered approximately equal numbers. This means that the plates in the postsneezing period probably collected particles of the same order of size as did the bubblers during sneezing. Once the rapidly falling droplets had left the air, settling plates collected small droplets or droplet nuclei which had become evenly dispersed throughout the room and settled slowly to the floor.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !k self assert = In the case of most carriers the greatest proportion of the streptococci expelled in saliva during sneezing fall rapidly to the ground and hence do not contaminate the air until they are resuspended as dust. Sneezing, moreover, contributes relatively little to the bacterial reservoirs in dust, bed clothing and elsewhere in the environment because it is not a common symptom in carriers.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !l self assert = In the present study of twenty carriers, only one discharged large numbers of these bacteria as tiny droplet nuclei during violent unbaffled sneezing although of course a carrier such as this one represents a real hazard. He possessed the two important requisites for the expulsion of large numbers of hemolytic streptococcus-containing droplet nuclei during sneezing: an unusually high contamination of the saliva (7,000,OOO per cc.) and a mechanically efficient atomizing capacity.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !m self assert = Since the concentration of alpha (salivary) streptococci per cc. of saliva is remarkably constant from one individual to another, the number of these microorganisms recovered from the air in large droplets or drdplet nuclei during sneezing provides a gobd index of the quality of sneezes.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !n self assert = Coughing does not ordinarily discharge saliva. A cough, because it originates in the back of the throat, disperses the secretions of the pharynx, the secretions of the nose if they have dripped back into the throat or material from below the larynx. This is confirmed bacteriologically by the absence of salivary streptococci from the air into which carriers coughed. The explanation of the failure of 95 per cent of carriers to expel beta streptococci by coughing, even though they were present in large numbers in the throat, is probably that the act of coughing, even volleys of twelve violent coughs, does not ordinarily shear off enough fluid from the mucous membranes of the posterior pharynx to carry significant numbers of these organisms.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !o self assert = One carrier, No. 21, expelled very large numbers, averaging 4 per cubic foot per cough, or 45 per cubic foot during the volley of twelve coughs. Quite large numbers were recovered by both bubblers and plates 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 feet from the cougher. Interestingly enough the air contained no alpha streptococci, indicating that the fluid coughed was not saliva but rather material the other hand, his saliva contained only 38,000 per cc. Further evidence that the saliva is not ordinarily the fluid which comprises cough droplets was the absence of alpha streptococci in the air in nearlyall the other cough tests.

  / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
  let !p self assert = Previous studies have shown that carriers exhibiting positive nose cultures for hemolytic streptococci were more likely to transmit infection than those with positive throat but negative nose cultures. Throat carriers whose nose cultures were negative were also occasionally found to be responsible for secondary cases of streptococcal infection. Carrier No. 20 of this present series, who sneezed very large numbers of hemolytic streptococci, exhibited negative nose cultures at the time of the test although the nose cultures had been positive a few days before. As mentioned in the text his saliva contained an unusually highconcentration of hemolytic streptococci.Such individuals, as well as some of thosedescribed in the earlier investigation ofcoughing and sneezing,’ represent throat carriers who are not innoccuous.

 / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
 let !q self assert = Talking- Almost no beta (or alpha) streptococci were expelled during talking. ‘No bubbler sample collected as many as one streptococcus per cubic foot, and twenty-nine of the thirty samplers in tests of ten carriers captured none at all. The settling plates likewise were practically free of streptococci, only three of thirty plates exhibiting one colony each.

 / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
 let !r self assert = A more precise understanding of the ro1e of sneezing in the transmission of different respiratory diseases may result from a study of the concentration of the infective agent in the saliva and of thefrequency of sneezing among carriers of the agent.

Contact at lunch with the index case or with one of the carriers was associated with carriage or illness (P = 0.026 and 0.054, respectively, by two-tailed Fishers exact test). Contact with the other four affected children and sharing food were not associated statistically with carriage

ref 'Jefferson_et_al_2008
  head = In this systematic review we found that physical barriers such as handwashing, wearing a mask, and isolation of potentially infected patients were effective in preventing the spread of respiratory virus infections.

  >>> Objective
    To systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

  >>> Data Extraction
    Search strategy of the Cochrane Library, Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, without language restriction, for any intervention to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hygiene). Study designs were randomised trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and controlled before and after studies.

  >>> Data Synthesis
    Of 2300 titles scanned 138 full papers were retrieved, including 49 papers of 51 studies. Study quality was poor for the three randomised controlled trials and most of the cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of most data except that from six case-control studies. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggest that the spread of respiratory viruses into the community can be prevented by intervening with hygienic measures aimed at younger children. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggests that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52); wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03); wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06); wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41); wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12); and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease the spread of respiratory disease remains uncertain. The lack of proper evaluation of global measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing prevent firm conclusions being drawn.

  >>> Conclusion
    Routine long term implementation of some physical measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult but many simple and low cost interventions could be useful in reducing the spread.

ref 'Ryan_et_al_2001
  head =  The implementation of this simple handwashing program in a Navy training camp was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of outpatient respiratory illness that was sustained over a 2-year period. Despite its success, maintenance of the handwashing program has been challenging in the time-constrained setting of military training.

  >>> Objectives
    In response to increasing concerns about respiratory illness in military recruits, a simple handwashing program was developed and evaluated at a large Navy training center.

  >>> Methods
    Clinical records from 1996 through 1998 were reviewed to determine weekly rates of respiratory illness before and after program implementation (1,089,800 person-weeks reviewed). A supplemental survey was given to a sample of recruits to assess self-reported respiratory illness and compliance with the handwashing program.

  >>> Results
    A 45% reduction in total outpatient visits for respiratory illness was observed after implementation of the handwashing program. No change was noted in hospitalization rates for respiratory illness, which remained low during the observation period. Survey data supported clinical observations, as frequent handwashers self-reported fewer respiratory illness episodes when compared to infrequent handwashers. Surveys also revealed challenges with handwashing compliance.

  >>> Conclusions
    Implementation of a handwashing program in this population of healthy young adults was associated with a marked reduction in outpatient visits for respiratory illness. Despite its success, maintenance of the handwashing program has been challenging in the time-constrained setting of military training.

  head = In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

  >>> Background
    During the current worldwide pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was first diagnosed in Iceland at the end of February. However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population.

  >>> Methods
    We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples.

  >>> Results
    As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.

  >>> Conclusions
    In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

  let !a self assert =  On April 4, 2020, among the 9199 persons who were targeted for testing, 1221 (13.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through population screening, positive results were reported for 100 of 13,080 participants (0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.0); positive test results were reported for 87 of 10,797 persons (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.0) who accepted the open invitation for testing and 13 of 2283 persons (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9) who were invited at random. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. These results were consistent with a slow spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the Icelandic population.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !b self assert = The lack of increase in the incidence of infection over time may be due to containment efforts by the Icelandic health care authorities and their nimble response to the outbreak abroad. Testing of exposed persons with symptoms had been carried out for 1 month before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was identified in Iceland. Self-isolation, quarantining, and other social-distancing measures may also have helped to prevent an increase in the infection rate.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !c self assert = Of the participants who tested positive from the early targeted-testing phase and who had traveled, 86.1% had visited areas designated as being at high risk by the end of February (China and the Alps mountain regions in Austria, Italy, and Switzerland), whereas only 1 of the participants with a positive test identified through population screening had traveled to a high-risk area. On the other hand, 12 of 87 participants (13.8%) with positive tests in the screening group had recently traveled to the United Kingdom, as compared with 1.8% of those who tested negative, which suggests relatively early spread of the virus in the U.K. population.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !d self assert = In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of the participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had recently traveled outside Iceland. In the later phase, 15.5% had recently traveled outside the country. Overall, 23.0% of those with positive test results through population screening had recently traveled, in contrast to 8.7% of those who tested negative.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !e self assert = In the early phase of targeted testing, 40.1% of the participants who tested positive reported having had contact with a known infected person, as compared with 60.2% in the later phase of targeted testing. However, only 6.9% of the participants in the population-screening group reported having had contact with an infected person, probably because infected persons and their contacts were in isolation and therefore not eligible for the population screening.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !f self assert = Among the participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms of Covid-19 were reported by 93% of those in the overall targeted-testing group and by 57% of those in the overall population-screening group. However, 29% of participants who tested negative in the overall population-screening group also reported having symptoms. Reports of symptoms became less common among participants in the population screening during the study period (despite the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate), probably owing to a general decrease in other respiratory infections, which in turn may have been brought about through measures implemented to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !g self assert = Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older.

  let !h self assert = Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%).

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !i self assert = The haplotype composition of the viruses from persons who were identified through population screening was different from that of viruses infecting persons who tested positive in the early phase of targeted testing, so we conclude that the haplotypes of the virus that were propagating in the general population came from a different source (as compared with those infecting high-risk persons in the early phase of targeted testing), perhaps brought into Iceland by persons arriving from countries that had not yet been designated as high-risk areas.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !j self assert = Several viral lineages have emerged during the 3 to 4 months since the original outbreak in China, with an average of five mutations separating the lineages from the founding haplotype from Wuhan (the central haplotype of clade A). Although the sequencing efforts vary considerably among populations, it is clear that the geographical distribution of clades is highly structured. Thus, A and B haplotypes are common in East Asia, whereas the B1a haplotype appears to be at the center of the outbreak on the West Coast of the United States, and A2a and its descendants are almost exclusively found in European populations.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !k self assert = The A1a haplotype was more common in the general population than in those who received targeted testing, with a total of 23 of 59 haplotypes among participants in the population-screening group, as compared with only 8 of 157 haplotypes in the early-targeted testing.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !l self assert = The composition of haplotypes changed substantially from early targeted testing to later targeted testing. The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes, which had collectively made up 103 of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early-targeted testing, were reduced to 115 of 361 haplotypes (31.9%) in the later-targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and other A2a-derived haplotypes. This change probably meant that population screening identified clusters of infected persons who seeded infection from areas that had not been designated as high risk, such as the United Kingdom. The relatively high prevalence of A1a and A2a clades in the later-targeted testing group was unsurprising: the targeted testing had been extended to include those who had traveled to additional high-risk areas, and population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform tracking efforts.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !m self assert = The A2a3a and A2a2a haplotypes were the two most common haplotypes in Iceland; of the 577 persons who provided samples that were sequenced, the A2a3a haplotype was found in 78 (13.5%) and the A2a2a haplotype was found in 45 (7.8%).

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !n self assert = Haplotype analysis that was based on SARS-CoV-2 sequences overlaid on contact-tracing networks16 showed concordance between the contacts identified by the tracking team and those based on viral sequences. Of the 369 pairs of persons found through contact tracing, 295 were consistent with the sequence data (i.e., their haplotypes differed by strictly less than 3 mutations).

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !o self assert = Haplotype analysis of the contact tracing network shows one of the most complex contact-tracing networks, in which clusters of persons returning from Italy or Austria transmitted the virus to persons in Iceland. The figure shows a network of 14 persons who were infected in Iceland. Haplotype analysis showed that these persons were infected by viruses with the A2a1 haplotype, more commonly imported from northern Italy than from Austria. This cluster also contained persons with a mutation that was specific to Iceland. The cluster can be traced to a person who had both mutated and wild-type haplotypes; those whom this person infected had only the mutated haplotype. We searched for persons carrying these mutations who were not associated with this cluster and found two who had probably been infected by someone in the cluster through an unknown contact.

  / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
  let !p self assert = We categorized exposure into six categories: family, social, tourism (working in the travel industry in Iceland), work (including schools), travel (international), and unknown and observed a shift in the composition of exposures from international travel and social exposure to familial exposure over time.

ref 'Jing_et_al_2020
  head = We found that COVID-19 patients in their incubation period were at least as infectious as during their illness period. SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.

  >>> Background
    As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive.

  >>> Methods
    Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and theinfectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.

  >>> Results
    A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (≥60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51- 0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.

  >>> Conclusions
    SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.

  let !d self assert = Most cases were found in the densely populated districts (56% of the total population in Guangzhou) including Yuexiu, Liwan, Haizhu, Tianhe and Baiyun. Three clusters with 5 or more secondary cases (not counting tertiary or further generations) were observed, one in each of Yuexiu, Haizhu and Baiyun districts, and all primary cases in these clusters were imported. The longest transmission chain had three subsequent generations from the primary case, which occurred in Panyu district. Five other clusters had two subsequent generations. The reported residential locations of primary and nonprimary cases within the same clusters are mostly identical, but non-household non-primary cases might live far from the primary cases. Most transmissions occurred between household members

A longer incubation periods is associated with a slightly lower, whereas a longer infectious period is associated with a slightly higher, SAR estimate. The household SAR varies from 12% to 17%, and the non-household SAR varied from 6% to 9%.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !g self assert = The local R based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was estimated to be 0.48 (0.39, 0.58), which is insensitive to the setting for the incubation and infectious periods. In other words, a typical case infected 0.48 individuals on average in Guangzhou, implying an inefficient transmission of the disease under the control measures. The projected local R, had there been no quarantine of cases, was estimated as 0.62 (0.51-0.75). High estimates of projected local R were associated with short incubation and longer infectious periods

In comparison to the elderly group (≥60 years old), the odds of infection is 0.27 (0.13-0.55) in the youngest group (<20 years old) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.54-1.20) in the younger adult group (20-59 years old). These age effects on susceptibility are insensitive to the assumptions about the natural history of disease. Cases <60 years old were slightly less infectious than those ≥60 years old, with ORs varying in the range of 0.73- 0.79 but not significantly different.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !j self assert = Restricting household contacts to those who were living at the same address as the primary case led to higher SAR estimates among household contacts, 16.4-23.4%, but lower SAR estimates among the non-household contacts under the various settings of the natural history of disease. Under the setting of the shortest incubation and infectious periods, the SAR was estimated as 19.3% (95% CI: 15.51-23.86%). The age effects and the relative infectivity of the illness period vs. the incubation period remained qualitatively similar.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !k self assert = We are the first to quantify the infectivity of COVID-19 patients during their incubation period using contact-tracing data, but qualitative evidence has been noted before. In our unpublished analysis of a separate dataset of case clusters in China, the mean serial interval (time between symptom onsets of a primary and a secondary  case) was shorter than the mean incubation period, suggesting that infectivity during the incubation period is not trivial. This finding has a profound implication on prevention and control strategies, e.g., the necessity of testing asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and the importance of wearing facial mask regardless of symptoms in order to curb the pandemic.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !l self assert = We estimated the local reproductive number to be relatively low, around 0.48, which is consistent with the average level of. We projected that, without isolation of cases and their contacts, the local reproductive number would have been about 30% higher to reach 0.62 in our primary analysis setting. This moderate effect of isolation is partly due to high infectivity during the incubation period, that is, many secondary cases had been infected before or shortly after the symptom onset of the primary cases before the primary cases were identified and isolated. This observation also implies that the low reproductive number in Guangzhou possibly resulted more from policies restricting human movement, limiting the number of contacts of COVID-19 cases during their entire infectious period including the incubation period, than from the detection and isolation of cases and close contacts.

  head = This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.

  >>> Abstract
    On the 21st of February 2020 a resident of the municipality of Vo, a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.

  >>> Abstract
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease with a high case-fatality rate and devastating socio-economic impact. In this report we summarized the results from an epidemiological investigation of a SARS outbreak in a hospital in Tianjin, between April and May 2003. We collected epidemiological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of SARS associated with the outbreak. Transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated. The outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters. All SARS cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people. The patients ranged from 16 to 82 years of age (mean age 38·5 years); 38·7% were men. The overall case fatality in the SARS outbreak was 11·7% (13/111). The outbreak lasted around 4 weeks after the index case was identified. SARS is a highly contagious condition associated with substantial case fatality; an outbreak can result from one patient in a relatively short period. However, stringent public health measures seemed to be effective in breaking the disease transmission chain.

  let !a self assert = Outbreak in Tianjin was initiated by a single patient from Beijing. The index case was treated in three hospitals in Tianjin and infected a large number of persons. In Hospital P alone, 33 SARS patients were directly infected by the index case.

  let !b self assert = Patient M clinical symptoms and examination results made one attending physician suspect SARS. Further investigation revealed the contact history with SARS in the Beijing hospital. Based on his clinical symptoms and contact history, patient M was immediately listed as a suspect SARS case. At 11:30 hours on 17 April, he was transferred to Tianjin Thorax Disease Hospital. He was treated there for 2 days before being transferred again to Tianjin Infectious Disease Hospital on 19 April at around midnight, where he died. Cases occurred after exposure to patient M in both these other hospitals and have been documented elsewhere. Briefly, 164 of the total 175 SARS in this city can be traced to patient M.

  let !c self assert = Of the 1140 hospital staff and patients in this hospital at the time, 111 were diagnosed as either suspect or probable cases. The crude attack rate was 9-7%. Among all cases observed in this hospital, 33 were infected directly from patient M and 89 of all 111 SARS patients in the hospital could be traced to him.

  / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
  let !d self assert = The latent period for the secondary cases varied from 2 to 11 days with a median latent time of 4 days. The outbreak started on 16 April, peaked on 24 April and lasted until 12 May.

  let !e self assert = Of the 111 people who became infected in Hospital P, 81-1% (90/111) of them were probable cases. The SARS infection pattern in Hospital P is consistent with a person-to-person transmission pattern. Cardiology Unit I, where the index patient was first seen, had the highest number of SARS patients.

  / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
  let !f self assert = However, the SARS outbreak in Hospital P as well as in Tianjin came under control after Tianjin municipal authorities, at various levels, acted aggressively to implement stringent measures to enhance active surveillance, isolate SARS patients, and quarantine those having possible contact with SARS patients. These measures proved effective and SARS transmission was halted.

  / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
  let !g self assert = Compared with the outbreak in Beijing [9-11] where effective SARS control was delayed for several weeks, stringent transmission control measures in Tianjin started sooner (i.e. 4 days) after the index case was identified. As a result, there were fewer community transmissions in Tianjin and a large proportion of SARS cases occurred within medical settings [12]. The number of cases from Hospital P accounted for 51-4 % of the SARS cases in Tianjin.

  / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
  let !h self assert = The term SARS super-spreader has been used to describe certain individuals who have been implicated in spreading SARS to numerous other individuals. SARS super-spreaders were noticed in several SARS outbreaks in 2003 [8, 14, 15]. The SARS outbreak in Tianjin as described in this paper seems typical of an outbreak associated with super-spreaders. While it is not clear whether super-spreaders are associated with more contagious viral strains or simply a result of unprotected natural transmission, it highlights the critical importance of early intervention in controlling SARS transmission.

  / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
  let !i self assert = Finally, this study only describes the outbreak in Hospital P. Most of the SARS cases in Tianjin occurred in this hospital. Thus, this study reflects one major component of the outbreak of SARS in Tianjin, providing a snapshot of a SARS outbreak in one hospital. Our findings add to our understanding of disease control, which may help us to better prepare to confront other emerging diseases in the future.

// A Major Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Hong Kong
doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa030685
ref 'Lee_et_al_2003
  head = We report an outbreak in our hospital of a deadly pneumonia, which caused rapid deterioration of pulmonary function requiring ICU admission in 23.2 percent of cases and mechanical ventilation in 13.8 percent. Within a period of less than two months, SARS has become a global health problem, prompting the WHO to issue a global alert for the first time in more than a decade.

  >>> Background
    There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. We report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 cases of suspected SARS during a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong.

  >>> Methods
    From March 11 to 25, 2003, all patients with suspected SARS after exposure to an index patient or ward were admitted to the isolation wards of the Prince of Wales Hospital. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

  >>> Results
    There were 66 male patients and 72 female patients in this cohort, 69 of whom were health care workers. The most common symptoms included fever (in 100 percent of the patients); chills, rigors, or both (73.2 percent); and myalgia (60.9 percent). Cough and headache were also reported in more than 50 percent of the patients. Other common findings were lymphopenia (in 69.6 percent), thrombocytopenia (44.8 percent), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels (71.0 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively). Peripheral air-space consolidation was commonly observed on thoracic computed tomographic scanning. A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04).

  >>> Conclusions
    SARS is a serious respiratory illness that led to significant morbidity and mortality in our cohort.

  let !a self assert = SARS developed in 69 health care workers and 16 medical students, all with unremarkable medical histories, after exposure at work in the medical ward for men where our index patient was hospitalized. The high infectivity was also demonstrated by the fact that there were 26 tertiary cases, which included family members of the infected health care workers.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !b self assert = We suspected that the infection was transmitted by droplets and possibly by fomites, and we therefore instituted both airborne precautions (e.g., use of the N-95 respirator) and contact precautions (e.g., use of gowns and gloves), as recommended by the CDC. However, the use of a jet nebulizer to administer aerosolized albuterol in the index patient had probably aggravated the spread of the disease by droplet infections.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !c self assert = In our cohort, most of the common bacterial pathogens were ruled out, in addition to viral diseases such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection. Moreover, lack of a response to the initial antimicrobial treatment we provided led to the suspicion that we were dealing with a novel virus that causes lower respiratory tract infection.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !d self assert = In the first 138 cases, we have identified several cardinal symptoms of SARS. Besides fever, chills, and rigor, which were present in more than 70 percent of cases, cough was present in more than 50 percent and dizziness in more than 40 percent of cases. Rigor may represent the viremic phase of the disease, which subsided gradually as the illness progressed. In addition, moderate lymphopenia and its subsequent progression, thrombocytopenia, a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels, and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels were prevalent in the early phase of the illness in our cohort; all these findings are quite different from those associated with pneumonia caused by usual bacterial pathogens. Although these symptoms and laboratory findings are nonspecific, the constellation of these features should alert medical practitioners to the possibility of SARS.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !e self assert = We have also found that the chest radiograph offers an important diagnostic clue to this condition. Typically, our patients presented with unilateral, predominantly peripheral areas of consolidation. After approximately one week, it progressed rapidly to bilateral patchy consolidation, and the extent of the lung opacities was correlated with the deterioration in respiratory function. In cases in which plain chest radiographs appeared normal in the presence of a high spiking fever and lymphopenia, CT of the thorax was a sensitive imaging approach for the diagnosis. The characteristic finding on CT was bilateral peripheral air-space ground-glass consolidation mimicking that in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !f self assert = In fact, the similarity of this radiographic picture to that of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and the similarity of the histologic features to those of early ARDS in postmortem studies have prompted us to use corticosteroids in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of SARS. In ARDS and particularly in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, corticosteroid therapy has been used with some success.7 The majority of our cohort appeared to have a response to corticosteroid therapy, in addition to ribavirin, with resolution of fever and lung opacities within two weeks.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !g self assert = In this study, we were able to identify some clinical and laboratory features on presentation that were associated with the adverse clinical outcome of respiratory failure requiring care in the ICU or death. Univariate analyses showed that advanced age, male sex, a high neutrophil count, a high peak creatine kinase level, high initial and peak lactate dehydrogenase levels, and a low serum sodium level were associated with an adverse outcome.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !h self assert = Only advanced age, a high neutrophil count, and a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level were independent predictors. Since high lactate dehydrogenase levels are often seen in association with tissue damage, we propose that this finding indicates more extensive lung injury. The significant association between a high neutrophil count and an adverse outcome remains to be explained.

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !i self assert = A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions (in our analyses, coexisting illness was not correlated with a poor outcome, probably because of the small number of such patients). In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04).

  / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
  let !j self assert = SARS has already become a global health hazard, and its high infectivity is alarming. The discovery of the infective agent and studies of its behavior are crucial to an understanding of this new disease. A reliable, rapid diagnostic test, based on blood samples or nasopharyngeal aspirates, is of great importance in the future management of this disease. Until such a diagnostic test is available, a clear picture of its clinical presentation will help physicians be on the alert for this condition. Early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate therapy are the keys in combating this deadly infection.

// Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence
doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04153
ref 'Lloyd-Smith_et_al_2005
  head = The central role of R0 in epidemic analysis is unassailable, but our findings show that emerging disease outbreaks cannot be fully understood if individual variation in infectiousness is neglected. Examination of other population processes dependent on small numbers of individuals may yield similar insights. Our findings also indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.

  >>> Abstract
    Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous ‘superspreading events’ in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.

  let !a self assert = According to this analysis, the great majority of SARS cases in Singapore were barely infectious (73% had ν < 1) but a small proportion were highly infectious (6% had ν > 8). This is consistent with field reports from SARS-afflicted regions5,6 but contrasts with published SARS models.

  / November, 2005 - Nature
  let !b self assert = Comparing results for eight directly transmitted infections reveals the differing degree of individual variation among diseases and outbreak settings. The Poisson offspring distribution is almost always strongly rejected. The geometric model has considerable support for several data sets, which indicates significant individual variation in transmission rates because real infectious periods are less dispersed than the exponential distribution. The negative binomial model is selected decisively for several data sets, and enables comparative study of diseases through the dispersion parameter.

  let !c self assert = Like SARS, measles in highly vaccinated populations shows high variation in two surveillance data sets, with narrow confidence intervals excluding the conventional models (note that heterogeneous vaccination coverage is an important environmental factor contributing to this pattern).Monkeypox and smallpox viruses show intermediate variation, consistent across multiple data sets, and pneumonic plague transmission is slightly less variable. Data limitations prevent definitive conclusions for other diseases.

  let !f self assert = For outbreaks avoiding stochastic extinction, epidemic growth rates strongly depend on variation in ν. Diseases with high individual variation show infrequent but explosive epidemics after introduction of a single case. This pattern recalls SARS in 2003, for which many settings experienced no epidemic despite unprotected exposure to SARS cases27,28, whereas a few cities suffered explosive outbreaks. Our results, using k̂ = 0.16 for SARS, explain this simply by the presence or absence of high-ν individuals in the early generations of each outbreak6. In contrast, conventional models (with k = 1 or k → ∞) cannot simultaneously generate frequent failed invasions and rapid growth rates without additional, subjective model structure.

  / November, 2005 - Nature
  let !g self assert = We analysed contact tracing data from four outbreaks before and after imposition of control measures. Control always lowered the estimated dispersion parameter (that is k̂c < k̂) as predicted by the individual-specific model, although small sample sizes often led to overlapping confidence intervals. This increased skew in transmission arose chiefly from undiagnosed or misdiagnosed individuals, who continued to infect others (and even cause SSEs), whereas controlled individuals infected very few. To further examine our control theories, we calculated  and  for each data set; k̂c was always closer to , although twice it fell between the two predictions, indicating a possible combination of control mechanisms. Real-world control thus seems to increase individual variation, favouring extinction but risking ongoing SSEs. Larger data sets are needed to establish this pattern definitively.

  / November, 2005 - Nature
  let !h self assert = If highly infectious individuals can be identified predictively (see Supplementary Notes) then the efficiency of control could be greatly increased. Focusing half of all control effort on the most infectious 20% of cases is up to threefold more effective than random control. When k = 0.1 or 0.5, outbreak containment is assured for targeted control levels at roughly half the threshold level of c = 1 - 1/R0 for random control. Gains in efficiency increase with more intense targeting of high-ν cases, but saturate as overall coverage c increases. Again, branching process theory generalizes these findings: for a given proportion c of individuals controlled, greater targeting of higher-ν individuals leads to lower effective reproductive number R and higher extinction probability q

  / November, 2005 - Nature
  let !i self assert = At a minimum, we propose a new measure for inclusion in outbreak reports: the proportion of cases not transmitting (p0), which, together with R0 is sufficient to estimate the degree of variation in ν. As more data become available, trends may emerge in the degree of variation present, for example, for different modes of spread or levels of virulence. Richer data sets may also enable testing of the branching process assumption that case outcomes are independent and identically distributed, by detecting possible correlations in ν values within transmission lineages or systematic changes as outbreaks progress.

// Outbreak of Tuberculosis among Regular Patrons of a Neighborhood Bar
doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199507273330404
ref 'Kline_et_al_1995
  head = We report an outbreak caused by nonresidential exposure at a neighborhood bar. A highly infectious person with cavitary tuberculosis spent much of his time at the bar for several months. He became increasingly symptomatic, yet remained untreated and without a diagnosis. Mental health problems and chronic alcoholism effectively blocked his access to health care. The result was an outbreak of tuberculosis among those who frequented the bar. The outbreak had a substantial impact on community health, contributing 35 percent of all new active cases of tuberculosis in Minneapolis during 1992.

  >>> Background
    Outbreaks of tuberculosis have been reported in prisons, nursing homes, urban homeless shelters, and other crowded settings. We report a nonresidential outbreak of tuberculosis that originated in a neighborhood bar.

  >>> Methods
    A homeless patient with highly infectious pulmonary tuberculosis was a regular patron of a neighborhood bar during a long symptomatic interval before diagnosis. We investigated 97 other regular customers and employees of the bar through interviews, tuberculin skin testing, and chest roentgenography. We performed DNA fingerprinting on isolates from the index patient and 11 other patients.

  >>> Results
    The index patient apparently infected 41 of 97 contacts (42 percent), resulting in 14 cases of active tuberculosis and 27 cases of infection but no disease (indicated by positive tuberculin skin tests). Four other cases of active tuberculosis occurred among regular customers of the bar who were missed by the contact investigation. There were also two secondary cases. Radiographic findings in active cases included upper-lobe disease in seven cases (three cavitary) and negative chest films at the time of diagnosis in four cases. All 12 culture isolates we tested had the same chromosomal-DNA restriction pattern.

  >>> Conclusions
    The spread of tuberculosis in a neighborhood bar can be a major public health problem. The high rate of infection and disease among the contacts was unexpected and was not due to coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Possible explanations include heavy alcohol use among the contacts, high infectivity of the index case, or both. Sputum cultures must be performed in tuberculin-positive contacts who have symptoms, even if the chest films are normal.

  let !a self assert = The index patient had a progressively worsening cough, and over a period of six months his weight declined from 80 to 49 kg. There was no intervention, however, even though he was eligible for health care under government programs. There was a public clinic within six blocks of the bar and a public hospital within three miles, yet he did not seek health care, nor did any of the bars employees or customers intervene.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !b self assert = Instead, the patient went untreated until he could barely stand unassisted, had extensive destruction of lung tissue, and had infected numerous others. His alcoholism and mental health problems were a highly effective barrier to health care. Though it would have been difficult, early intervention would probably have reduced the extent of the outbreak.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !c self assert = The index patient proved highly infectious. Forty-one of 97 contacts (42 percent) interviewed at the bar were infected. Active tuberculosis developed in 14 of 97 (14 percent). These numbers are higher than expected. In a typical contact investigation, approximately 20 to 30 percent of the close contacts have positive tuberculin skin tests and in only 1 or 2 percent does active tuberculosis develop.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !d self assert = Also higher than expected was the proportion of the people we surveyed who were infected but without disease initially (i.e., they had positive tuberculin skin tests, normal chest films, and no symptoms), yet who later progressed to active disease.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !e self assert = Nineteen such people were offered isoniazid prophylaxis. Six completed therapy and remained well, but 13 refused preventive therapy or were noncompliant. In 3 of these 13 (23 percent), active tuberculosis developed within two years.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !f self assert = Typically, in approximately 5 percent of the people who convert to positive tuberculin skin tests, active tuberculosis develops in one year, and in an additional 5 percent it develops at some time during their lives.10 A higher rate of active disease after conversion of the tuberculin test is expected among people infected in infancy, during puberty and adolescence, and in senescence, and those infected with HIV.10,11 However, all the contacts at the bar in whom active tuberculosis developed were adults, and only one was HIV-positive.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !g self assert = Our study suggests that initial infection may progress to active disease more frequently in heavy alcohol users. Another factor contributing to the high incidence of both infection and active disease at the bar may have been the high infectivity of the index patient.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !h self assert = RFLP analysis proved very useful in our investigation and supplemented standard epidemiologic procedures. The same 15 repeats of the insertion sequence were found in all the isolates we tested. The genetic fingerprint of the outbreak strain helped prove linkage among the infected people, including one person with exogenous reinfection, four with upper-lobe disease that resembled endogenous reactivation, and two who were missed by the contact investigation and presented more than two years later.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !i self assert = In a study of an outbreak of tuberculosis in a homeless shelter, Nardell and colleagues also identified cases of exogenous reinfection and of upper-lobe disease resembling endogenous reinfection. They used phage typing and the resistance patterns of culture isolates to link cases to the outbreak. Our findings support their conclusion that the radiographic pattern of disease may not distinguish reactivation tuberculosis from primary infection acquired during an outbreak.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !j self assert = Four symptomatic participants had positive sputum cultures but negative chest films. Active pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with negative chest films, an underappreciated combination, has been reported, particularly in immunocompromised patients. In the context of a contact investigation, a negative chest film in a tuberculin-positive subject does not rule out active tuberculosis.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !k self assert = The cost of failing to complete prophylactic treatment was very high. Of 13 tuberculin-positive contacts who refused isoniazid prophylaxis or did not comply with the regimen, 3 had their conditions progress to active tuberculosis within two years.

  / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
  let !l self assert = Our experience suggests that chronic alcoholism is such a high-risk factor for progression to active disease that major efforts to ensure completion of six months of isoniazid therapy are worthwhile for tuberculin-positive heavy drinkers who are close contacts of people with active disease.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.1.338
ref 'Woolhouse_et_al_1997
  head = From an analysis of the distributions of measures of transmission rates among hosts, we identify an empirical relationship suggesting that, typically, 20% of the host population contributes at least 80% of the net transmission potential, as measured by the basic reproduction number, R0. This is an example of a statistical pattern known as the 20/80 rule. The rule applies to a variety of disease systems, including vector-borne parasites and sexually transmitted pathogens. The rule implies that control programs targeted at the “core” 20% group are potentially highly effective and, conversely, that programs that fail to reach all of this group will be much less effective than expected in reducing levels of infection in the population as a whole.

  let !a self assert = The results suggest that heterogeneities in contact rates lead to consistent and substantial increases in the value of R0, by factors in the range 2 to 4 for vector-borne infections and considerably higher for STDs. This may well apply to other infectious agents where “contact” is less easy to quantify. In practice, additional heterogeneities are also likely to contribute to the effects on R0.

  let !b self assert = In the case of the STD study from France, only 13% of the adult population had any new sexual partners during 1 year and thus made any contribution to R0 over that time scale. For all other nine data sets, Rc can reduced by more than 80% of R0 by removing 20% of households or individuals; we refer to this empirical observation as the 20/80 rule.

  / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
  let !c self assert = Biting by mosquitoes of humans is not random, and attractiveness may be related to sex, skin surface area (hence age), and other factors. Susceptibility to schistosome infection varies with the nature of contacts, possibly with skin thickness and lipid content and may be related to genetic factors. Risk of STD transmission is affected by the frequency and type of sexual acts and by cofactors. Acquired immunity may also affect host susceptibility to infection (55, 56), but this is not relevant to analyses of R0, which is defined with respect to a fully susceptible (naive) population. The magnitude of the effect of these other heterogeneities at the population level is unknown; but they will not decrease R0 unless negatively correlated with the variables analyzed here.

  / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
  let !d self assert = There may also be effects of “higher order” heterogeneities, all of which may further increase R0: heterogeneities in the distribution of vectors; differing usage of different water contact sites; patterns of contact between highly sexually active and less sexually active groups, and differences between the sexes (58). Consistency through time of the heterogeneities in transmission rates is also important.

  / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
  let !e self assert = Clearly, if the relative contribution of each host subgroup to R0 is itself variable then the fraction to be targeted must be continually reappraised. For human malaria in Tanzania over 12 months and in Papua New Guinea over 28 months, and for canine leishmaniasis over consecutive years, there is little variation in the relative abundance of vectors compared across households. Such information is not available for behaviors associated with the transmission of either schistosomiasis or STDs. It is important that the time scale of the observation of contact rates is sufficient to properly characterize their distribution across the host population

  / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
  let !f self assert = Although the actual values of R0 for any given infectious agent will vary between locations and through time, the heterogeneities in transmission rates recorded in this study suggest that targeted interventions can, in principle, induce very substantial reductions in rates of infection. This has been suggested before, but the novelty of the result lies in the apparent conformity with the 20/80 rule found across widely different host–parasite associations and in the relative magnitude of the contribution to the transmission potential (over 80%) made by a small fraction (20%) of the host population.

  / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
  let !g self assert = In the application of this empirical rule the key issues will be the methods used and the costs entailed in identifying the “core” transmitters. Put simply, if the cost of identifying and treating the core 20% is less than the cost of treating the entire population then targeting control interventions such as vaccination, drug treatment, or exposure protection may be preferred to nontargeted interventions on economic grounds. What is lacking in public health research into disease control is a quantitative assessment of the relative costs and effects. The 20/80 rule should encourage efforts to make such assessments.

We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.

  >>> Abstract
    The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.

  head = The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.

  >>> Summary
    Early studies that explored host-pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.

  head = This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses.

  >>> Abstract
    The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARSCoV-2 undergo intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is necessary to determine if this remains true.

// Pregnancy upregulates angiotensin type 2 receptor expression and increases blood flow in uterine arteries of rats
doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioy130
ref 'Mishra_et_al_2018
  head = This study demonstrates that pregnancy causes a reprogramming of the Ang II receptor expression pattern, resulting in ontogenic increase in uterine arterial AT2R levels that coincides with Ang II increase and relates to the onset and magnitude of uterine blood flow increase in pregnant rats. Estrogens appear to directly upregulate uterine vascular AT2R independent of any endogenous factors. This suggests that local uterine vascular RAS, in addition to central RAS, may play an important role in maintenance of blood flow to the uteroplacental unit.

  >>> Abstract
    Normal pregnancy is associated with decreased uterine vascular contraction and increased blood flow even though angiotensin II (AngII) levels are increased. AngII not only activates the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) to mediate vasoconstriction but also angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) to cause vasodilation. We hypothesized that upregulation of AT2R expression and function accounts for increased uterine artery blood flow during pregnancy. Virgin, pregnant (at different days of gestation) and post-partum Sprague-Dawley rats were used to determine uterine artery hemodynamics using micro ultrasound and plasma angiotensin II levels by ELISA. Isolated uterine arteries were examined for AT1R and AT2R expression and isometric contraction/relaxation. Plasma AngII levels were steady up to mid-pregnancy, increased as pregnancy advanced, reaching a peak in late pregnancy, and then restored to pre-pregnant levels after delivery. The pattern of increase in AngII levels mirrored a parallel increase in uterine blood flow. AT1R expression did not change, but AT2R expression increased during pregnancy correlating with uterine blood flow increase. Treatment with the AT2R antagonist PD123319 reduced uterine arterial blood flow. Vasoconstriction to angiotensin II was blunted in pregnant rats. Treatment with PD123319 caused greater enhancement of AngII contraction in pregnant than virgin rats. Ex vivo exposure of estradiol to uterine arterial rings dose dependently upregulated AT2R expression, that was inhibited by estrogen receptor antagonist. These results demonstrate that elevated AngII levels during gestation induce an increase in uterine blood flow via heightened AT2R-mediated signaling. Estrogens appear to directly upregulate uterine vascular AT2R independent of any endogenous factors.

In vivo administration of PD123319 can also act by blocking AT2R’s expressed in the heart and kidneys.

  let !b self assert = In the present study, Ang II-induced contractile responses were significantly blunted in pregnant rats compared to nonpregnant rats. The ED50 and Emax were reduced in the pregnant than nonpregnant rats correlating with the increase in AT2R expression and decrease in RI. The findings that PD123319 significantly increased Ang II-induced contractions in uterine arteries of pregnant rats and that its blockade abrogated the difference in the Ang II-induced contractions between nonpregnant and pregnant uterine arteries indicate that pregnancy-induced attenuation in uterine arterial contractions to Ang II is conferred primarily by enhanced AT2R activity.

Importantly, inhibition of estradiol receptors with ICI 182,780 abolished estradiol-induced upregulation of AT2R mRNA (n = 6) and protein (n = 5) (and B; P < 0.05), suggesting a direct effect of estradiol on AT2R expression in uterine arteries in an estradiol receptor-dependent manner.

  let !d self assert = The finding that ex vivo estradiol exposure in uterine arteries upregulates AT2R mRNA suggests that AT2R is a physiological target for estradiol and that estrogens can directly regulate the transcription of AT2R independent of any endogenous factors.

  / November, 2018 - Biology of Reproduction
  let !e self assert = This is consistent with the finding that estradiol upregulates AT2R in the kidneys and myometrium. Possible mechanisms include modulation of AT2R transcription through estrogen response elements. Although the AT2R promoter does not contain estrogen response elements, estrogen may activate AT2R transcription from alternative response elements such as the activator protein site (AP-1). Intriguingly, estradiol does not upregulate AT2R expression in the lungs and urinary bladder. Why estradiol selectively regulates AT2R expression in certain tissues but not others remain to be clarified.

Although this prevalence has limited generalizability to geographic regions with lower rates of infection, it underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients. Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.

// Impact of statin therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) depends on ARDS severity: a prospective observational cohort study
doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0368-6
ref 'Mansur_et_al_June_2015
  head = The main finding of this investigation was that patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS who received statin therapy had a significantly better 28-day survival rate compared with those without this therapy. This evidence of a beneficial impact of statin continuation on severe ARDS patients suggests that statin therapy should be continued for all critically ill patients who are at high risk of developing sepsis or infection, i.e., those undergoing surgical procedures with a high infection risk.

  >>> Background
    Previous investigations have presumed a potential therapeutic effect of statin therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Statins are expected to attenuate inflammation in the lungs of patients with ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical investigations of the role of statin therapy have revealed contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate whether pretreatment and continuous therapy with statins in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS are associated with 28-day survival according to disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe).

  >>> Methods
    Patients with sepsis-associated ARDS from the surgical intensive care were enrolled in this prospective observational investigation. ARDS was classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe); 28-day mortality was recorded as the primary outcome variable and organ failure was recorded as secondary outcome variable. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the requirements for organ support were evaluated throughout the observational period to assess organ failure.

  >>> Results
    404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS were enrolled in this investigation. The distribution of the ARDS subgroups was 13 %, 59 %, and 28 % for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Statin therapy improved 28-day survival exclusively in the patients with severe ARDS compared with patients without statin therapy (88.5 % and 62.5 %, respectively; P = 0.0193). To exclude the effects of several confounders, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis, which showed that statin therapy remained a significant covariate for mortality (hazard ratio, 5.46; 95 % CI, 1.38–21.70; P = 0.0156). Moreover, after carrying a propensity score-matching in the severe ARDS cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the improved 28-day survival among patients with statin therapy (P = 0.0205). Patients with severe ARDS who received statin therapy had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those without statin therapy (13 ± 7 and 9 ± 7, respectively; P = 0.0034), and they also required less extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and had more ECMO-free days (18 ± 9 and 15 ± 9, respectively; P = 0.0873).

  >>> Conclusions
    This investigation suggests a beneficial effect of continuous statin therapy in patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS and a history of prior statin therapy. Further study is warranted to elucidate this potential effect.

  let !b self assert = We found that the beneficial impact of statin therapy was accompanied by significantly lower organ-specific SOFA scores in three organ systems (the cardiovascular, central nervous, and hepatic systems) among the patients on statin therapy.

  / June, 2015 - BMC Medicine
  let !f self assert = Similarly, the observed lower hepatic SOFA scores can be explained by the fact that statin therapy has a beneficial effect on liver function. As shown by Arnaud et al., statins exert direct anti-inflammatory effects on hepatocytes by reducing IL-6-induced CRP production.

ref 'Simonnet_et_al_2020
  head = This cohort study showed that obesity is a factor in disease severity of SARS-CoV2, having greatest impact in patients with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2. Patients with obesity and especially those with severe obesity should take extra measures to avoid COVID-19 contamination by enforcing prevention during the current pandemic.

  >>> Objective
    The Covid‐19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America, where obesity is highly prevalent. The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has not been fully documented.

  >>> Methods
    In this retrospective cohort study we analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS‐CoV‐2, in a single French center.

  >>> Results
    Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (p<0.01, Chi square test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (p<0.05) and BMI (p<0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 vs patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 was 7.36 (1.63‐33.14; p=0.02)

// Saliva is more sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 detection in COVID-19 patients than nasopharyngeal swabs
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067835
ref 'Wyllie_et_al_2020
  head = The results indicate that using saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection is more sensitive and consistent than using nasopharyngeal swabs. Overall, we demonstrate that saliva should be considered as a reliable sample type to alleviate COVID-19 testing demands.

  >>> Abstract
    Rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is essential for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because (1) collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and (2) saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.

  let !a self assert = We found strong concordance between the U.S. CDC “N1” and “N2” primer-probe sets ,  and thus calculated virus titers (virus copies/mL) using only the “N1” set. From all positive samples tested ( n = 46 nasopharyngeal, 37 saliva), we found that the geometric mean virus titers from saliva were about 5⨉ higher than nasopharyngeal swabs (p < 0.05,Mann-Whitney test)

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !b self assert = When limiting our analysis to only patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples (n = 38 for each sample type), we found that SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva were significantly higher than nasopharyngeal swabs ( p = 0.0001, Wilcoxon test;). Moreover, we detected SARS-CoV-2 from the saliva but not the nasopharyngeal swabs from eight matching samples (21%), while we only detected SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs and not saliva from three matched samples (8%). Overall, we found higher SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva than nasopharyngeal swabs from hospital inpatients.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !c self assert = Our nasopharyngeal swab results are consistent with previous reports of variable SARS-CoV-2 titers and results. We found 5 instances where a participant’s nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 followed by a positive result during the next collection (5/33 repeats, 33%;). In longitudinal saliva collections from 12 patients, however, there were no instances in which a sample tested negative and was later followed by a positive result. As true negative test results are important for clinicians to track patient improvements and for decisions regarding discharges, our data suggests that saliva is a more consistent sample type than nasopharyngeal swabs for monitoring temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 titers.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !d self assert = While human RNase P detection was better from saliva in both the inpatient and healthcare worker cohorts, this alone may not indicate better virus detection. More importantly, we found that human RNase P detection was more variable from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from inpatients (p=0.0001, F test for variances) and self-collected from healthcare workers (p = 0.0002;). Our results suggest that saliva may also be an appropriate, and perhaps more sensitive, alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for screening asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. however, a larger sample size is needed to confirm.

  / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !e self assert = We found that the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection from saliva is comparable, if not superior to nasopharyngeal swabs in early hospitalization and is more consistent during extended hospitalization and recovery.

// Elevated exhaustion levels and reduced functional diversity of T cells in peripheral blood may predict severe progression in COVID-19 patients
doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-020-0401-3
ref 'Zheng_et_al_2020
  head = The data indicate that COVID-19, similar to some chronic infections, damages the function of CD4+ T cells and promotes excessive activation and possibly subsequent exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Together, these perturbations of T cell subsets may eventually diminish host antiviral immunity. It also indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may possess a unique immune pathology compared to other coronaviruses.

// SARS-CoV-2 Infection of the Placenta
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.20083907
ref 'Hosier_et_al_2020
  head = These findings suggest that Covid-19 may have contributed to placental inflammation that ultimately resulted in early-onset preeclampsia and worsening maternal disease.

  >>> Abstract
    Background: The effects of Covid-19 in pregnancy remain relatively unknown. We present a case of second trimester pregnancy with symptomatic Covid-19 complicated by severe preeclampsia and placental abruption. Methods: We analyzed placenta for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular and immunohistochemical assays and by and electron microscopy, and we measured the maternal antibody response in blood to this infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. Conclusion: This case demonstrates, for the first time, SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.

  let !b self assert = Intervillositis, as seen in this case, describes a placental pathology consisting of fibrin deposits and mononuclear cell infiltration of the intervillous spaces. It is associated with high rates of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, and severe early preeclampsia. This entity is typically idiopathic or autoimmune in nature, but can also be seen in association with infections such as cytomegalovirus as well as malaria. Massive fibrin deposition was also noted as a feature of placental pathology in pregnant women with SARS as well as malaria. In this case, it remains unknown whether Covid-19 precipitated intervillositis.

  / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
  let !c self assert = However, the massive macrophage infiltration alongside fibrin deposition has recently been observed in lung tissue examined at autopsy from patients with severe Covid-19, raising the possibility of a common immunopathology leading to macrophage recruitment and activation causing tissue damage. Further studies of placenta from women with Covid-19 may help address whether this is a histological feature associated with placental SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  let !d self assert = This patient’s thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia were more severe than what would have been expected from Covid-19 alone.

  let !e self assert = Importantly, there were no amino acid differences found in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequenced from the placenta compared to others sequenced from around the world , suggesting that placenta nvasion is not a unique feature of this virus and it does not require adaptation. Rather, given the patient’s high serum titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies, a potential mechanism to explain placental invasion in this case would be antibody dependent transcytosis mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which has previously been observed for other viruses including CMV, HIV, and Zika.
