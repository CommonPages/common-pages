  # doi is not working, Convalescent Plasma
  // Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19. A randomized clinical trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.01.20139857

    head = The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. After discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No statistically significant differences in mortality or improvement in the day-15 disease severity was observed when the study was suspended.

    >>> Background
      After recovery from COVID-19, most patients have anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15.

    >>> Results
      The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care.

    >>> Conclusion
      Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

Donors had been symptomatic for a median of 12 days (IQR 8 - 18) and were younger compared to patients with a substantially milder disease course.  78% and 43% had PRNT50 titers of at least 1:80 or 1:320 respectively. This resulted in the use of plasma from 19 donors and with a median titer of 1:640 (IQR 1:320 - 1:1280).

The SARS-CoV2 PRNT50 titer could be measured in 56 of these 66 and in 44 (79%) neutralizing antibodies at a titer of ≥1:20 were detected. The median PRNT50 titer in these 56 patients was comparable to the titer observed in the overall donor population (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40).

Here as well we found that 26/37 (70%) of patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig antibodies and in 23/37 (62%) at a ratio >10, indicating high neutralization capacity.

    let !i self assert = In a post-hoc analysis we evaluated if ConvP administration accelerated the increase in neutralizing antibody titers over time. For this, the PRNT50 titers on day 7 were compared with the titers on day 1 in the subgroup of patients with a titer <1:160 at baseline. In all 9 patients, including 5 randomized to standard of care, a fourfold increase in titers was observed on day 7.

    let !j self assert = Recent observations from our laboratory indicate that a positive Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ig ELISA with an OD ratio ≥10 correlates well with a PRNT50 titer of at least 1:80. This could already help to reliably exclude donors with low neutralizing antibody when PRNT is unavailable, although it will not guarantee high PRNT50 titers.

    / July, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !k self assert = Our data also show that in hospitalized patients testing for the presence of antibodies prior to ConvP should be part of the protocol, and stratifying or even excluding patients based on a positive antibody test will be needed. With the large variety of serological assays that have come available, it is important to carefully validate the assays prior to use and ideally correlate the assay to gold standard virus neutralization assays.

    / July, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !l self assert = Second, ConvP may have an effect that is unrelated to the neutralizing antibodies because therapy with intravenous immunoglobulines or plasma can have diverse anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects as well. However, we considered any such effect unlikely because doses of Ig therapy when used as an immunomodulatory agent are typically at least 10-fold higher than the quantity of mmunoglobulinsin 300ml plasma.

    head = An alternative method is sampling from the mask of the patient. This approach will be advantageous, simple, safe, easy to use and non-invasive. The size of the respiratory droplet is from >5 to 10 μm in diameter and Edwards et al. demonstrated that during normal breathing many people generate a substantial number of aerosols ~150 nm in diameter. Hence, N95 masks can offer an easy adjunct for NP samples.

    let !a self assert = The N95 masks use charged electret fibres as the filtering medium, and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that they collect >95% of the aerosolized virus. In 2008, Huynh et al., developed a novel prototype mask-like sampling device. It was made from impermeable and stretchable PVC. It contained an electret (25-mm diameter) opposite the nose and mouth region. This sampling device had low airflow resistance (15 mmH2O) at normal respiratory flows and was able to collect 80% of 0.52-µm latex particles (virus droplet representative). Hence, after sampling, electret can be easily removed, placed in RNA lysis buffer and PCR can be performed.

    let !b self assert = In a recent study by Williams et al.,face-mask sampling offered an efficient and non-invasive method for detection of exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a high sensitivity of 86·5%. In this simple technique, the person wears a face mask containing strips made of a gelatin sampling matrix for a duration of 30 minutes. These moist strips will trap the virus in the matrix and can then be preserved after drying out and used for virus isolation. The preserved strips can be directly transported to the laboratory, precluding the need for special storage before analysis. This method obviates the need for health-care workers, and no expertise is required to collect the samples

    / July, 2020 - Clinical Microbiology and Infection
    let !c self assert = The major limitation of this method is that it is patient-dependent. Non-compliance in a claustrophobic patient can limit the sensitivity of detection. Another concern is the storage of samples. An NP swab in Viral Transport Medium can be refrigerated at 2°C–8°C for 48 hours and at –70°C for a longer duration and has a shelf life of 5 years. Storage and shelf life of the mask with gelatin strips warrants more studies.

Another study that claimed survival of 4 days used a similarly large sample (10⁶ infectious virus particles) on the surface. A report by van Doremalen and colleagues found survival of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 of up to 2 days (on surfaces) and 3 days (in aerosols generated in the laboratory), but again with a large inoculum (10⁵–10⁷ infectious virus particles per mL in aerosols, 10⁴ infectious virus particles on surfaces).

  # BCG, CQ and HCQ
  // BCG vaccination policy and preventive chloroquine usage: do they have an impact on COVID-19 pandemic?
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2720-9
  ref 'Sharma_et_al_07_08_2020
    head = We have presented the data, suggesting that the BCG immunization correlates with lower incidence and gravity of the COVID-19 disease across different countries, even when the BCG immunization was performed in childhood. The literature on CQ and HCQ has so far exclusively dealt in therapeutic role in  advanced stages. We have instead emphasized the possible chemoprophylactic role of CQ and HCQ: even if the evidence for it is admittedly only circumstantial.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the light of its rapid global spreading, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Interestingly, the global spreading of the disease is not uniform, but has so far left some countries relatively less affected. The reason(s) for this anomalous behavior are not fully understood, but distinct hypotheses have been proposed. Here we discuss the plausibility of two of them: the universal vaccination with Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) and the widespread use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ). Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful. The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination. We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse. Taken together, the data in the literature have led to the suggestion of a possible inverse correlation between BCG immunization and COVID-19 disease incidence and severity.

    # let !a self assert = The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !a self assert = The six major BCG strains, namely Pasteur 1173 P2, Danish 1331, Glaxo 1077 (derived from the Danish strain), Tokyo 172-1, Russia BCG-I, and Moreau RDJ, now account for >90% of the BCG vaccines employed worldwide 25. As five different strains of BCG were employed in different countries, we analyzed their correlative efficacy in protecting against COVID-19. Our data have shown that mixed and JAPAN strains seem superior to the DANISH strain.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !c self assert = BCG exhibits efficacy against disseminated TB and meningitis in childhood26,27; currently, ~100 million children are vaccinated every year worldwide. However, the vaccine exhibits poor efficacy against adult pulmonary TB and several countries have, therefore, discontinued BCG immunization. Subsequently, BCG was shown to exhibit protective effects against leprosy, buruli ulcer, and several other diseases, including those not associated with mycobacteria. BCG is a potent immunomodulator, especially of the cell-mediated immunity, and is employed for the treatment of cancers such as that of the bladder. It is actually being tested for several other cancers. Recently, BCG was shown to exhibit efficacy against type I diabetes. This was first shown in mice in Edmonton in 1993, which also partially protects against sepsis and respiratory infections when given following early infection.

    / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    let !a self assert = The results show that countries without a universal BCG policy (such as Belgium, Italy, the United States, and the Netherlands) have increased incidence of COVID-19 (2810.9 ± 497.1 (mean ± SEM) per million) compared with countries with ongoing national BCG policy (570.9 ± 155.6 (mean ± SEM) per million). The incidence for countries that discontinued BCG vaccination was intermediate between these two groups (1844.67 ± 508.89 (mean ± SEM) per million).

    / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    let !b self assert = In terms of morbidity, the countries with a universal BCG policy exhibited the lowest number of deaths due to COVID-19 (92.4 ± 34.7 (mean ± SEM) per million), which is significantly lower than that for countries that discontinued universal BCG vaccination (104.5 ± 33.6 (mean ± SEM) per million) (p = 0.001, Mann–Whitney U-test). Countries with no BCG vaccination were most profoundly affected (186.1 ± 56.8 (mean ± SEM) per million). These results are in line with two previous reports.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !f self assert = This type of analysis does not reflect the true impact of BCG against COVID-19. For example, a country with a higher percentage of population of elderly people may report more deaths than a country with a relatively younger population, simply because of increased comorbidities that worsen disease severity. Unfortunately, not enough public data are available to analyze the impact of such confounding factors.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !g self assert = The results represent the distribution of disease incidence among different age groups for the three different types of countries, indicating three significant features as follows: (i) the disease incidence is very low for subjects <15 years of age and does not show significant dependence on the presence or absence of universal BCG vaccination policies. This is possibly due to high resistance of young people to symptomatic disease. (ii) The number of infected cases across the age groups is always higher for countries without universal BCG vaccination policy. (iii) The differences between countries with universal BCG vaccine policy and countries without such a policy increase and reach their peak for age groups 45–64 and 65–79 years. The difference in the number of confirmed cases in these age groups is ~550–600 per million of the population between countries with vs. without universal BCG vaccination policy.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !h self assert = The reduction in disease incidence seems significant for countries without universal BCG vaccination policy, where the number of confirmed cases per million is quite high for the younger age groups.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !j self assert = The results show that the distribution of fatal cases per million of people across different age groups for countries without mass vaccination and countries with discontinued mass vaccination are not significantly different (p = 0.41, Mann–Whitney U-test). With increasing age, the death toll increases for countries without or discontinued BCG vaccination programs. In comparison, the mortality is quite consistent and rises only slightly in the elderly population. Differences in the death toll between countries with or without a national BCG program thus suggest that BCG has a role in lowering the COVID-19 casualty by manifold.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !k self assert = Although our results indicate a correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 progression/mortality, one should also note that the confirmed cases to death ratio varies widely among the countries analyzed. This might be due to different strains of BCG used in these countries for an induced trained immunity.

    / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    let !c self assert = We found that countries adopting a mixture of different strains of the BCG vaccine such as South Korea and the Philippines reported a lower number of confirmed and fatal cases. The BCG-Denmark and BCG-Russia strains correlated poorly in terms of limiting the COVID-19 spread and casualty. Taken together, the bulk of the data of the analysis appear to be compatible with a correlation between BCG vaccination and susceptibility to COVID-19 disease.

    / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    let !d self assert = To this end, a discussion related to certain countries, which have performed very differently compared with other countries is essential. One such example is Brazil. Even if it is a country with universal BCG vaccination policy, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is the highest among the countries with similar vaccination strategy. This could be due to the use of the BCG-Brazil strain, which has been found ineffective against COVID-19.

    / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    let !e self assert = The case of Russia is probably similar, as the BCG strain used in Russia is probably also not effective against the coronavirus. A country that has done extremely well in restricting the COVID-19 spread is Australia. Although Australia has dropped its BCG program back in 1985, the number of incident and deaths due to COVID-19 are very low. This could be due to very low population density of Australia, which helped to restrict the spread of the virus effectively.

    / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    let !f self assert = Similarly, the BCG vaccine, which is routinely administered to all newborns in Israel and was administered to immigrants with unknown vaccination records, showed no statistically significant difference in the susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !p self assert = We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic. The possibility that the diffuse use of CQ and HCQ may possibly have a chemoprophylactic role in the populations that have so far been much less affected by the pandemic, e.g., those of most African countries or of India, could not be based on the accurate numerical analyses done for the BCG vaccination. However, although highly circumstantial, it should still be discussed, considering the still very diffuse consumption of CQ by populations in which malaria is still endemic.

    # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
    # let !q self assert = However, caution should be taken, as observational clinical trials for HCQ in COVID-19 patients was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death also in association with azithromycin and in view of potential toxicity as well. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the negative results of the “Solidarity” international trial on HCQ21 have been indicated to be flawed. In any case, the “therapeutic” effect would not concern the discussion in this contribution, as we are considering its possible prophylactic role.

  ref 'Wrobel_et_al_07_09_2020
    head = Structural and biochemical data indicate that a bat virus, similar to RaTG13, would not be able to bind effectively to human ACE2 receptor and would be unlikely to infect humans directly. Our observations support the involvement of recombination between distinct coronavirus genomes in the generation of SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have emerged from bats, possibly via a secondary host. Here, we investigate the relationship of spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 with the S protein of a closely related bat virus, RaTG13. We determined cryo-EM structures for RaTG13 S and for both furin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; we compared these with recently reported structures for uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S. We also biochemically characterized their relative stabilities and affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Although the overall structures of human and bat virus S proteins are similar, there are key differences in their properties, including a more stable precleavage form of human S and about 1,000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor. These observations suggest that cleavage at the furin-cleavage site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S and facilitates the adoption of the open conformation that is required for S to bind to the ACE2 receptor.

    let !a self assert = Structure of protease-cleaved SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein: The observation here of a substantially populated (39%) intermediate form, in which one of the RBDs is disordered and two of NTDs have shifted, suggests that this conformation, which is possibly transient, will lead to a receptor-binding-competent form. Thus, we suspect that, in addition to its requirement for membrane fusion, efficient protease cleavage might be selected to ensure there is a higher proportion of S protein on the virus surface that is capable of binding to receptor.

    / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
    let !b self assert = Although the loop containing the cleavage site (residues 676–689) is disordered, in both cleaved and uncleaved forms, the observation of the intermediate form and the much lower thermal stability of the cleaved protein suggest that cleavage reduces the overall stability of S. This reduction in stability may facilitate the movement of the NTDs and the RBDs, enabling, finally, the adoption of the open, receptor-binding-competent form.

    / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
    let !c self assert = Comparison with the S glycoprotein from the bat virus RaTG13: Thermal-stability data show that the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S trimer has a markedly higher stability than the bat virus protein does, whereas the cleaved SARS-CoV-2 has a similar stability to the (uncleaved) bat virus protein. Perhaps the higher stability of SARS-CoV-2 S is required to offset some of the loss of stability that occurs upon cleavage. These structural and biochemical data together suggest that the furin-cleavage site might confer the human virus with an advantage, as the cleavage facilitates a higher proportion of the open, receptor-binding-competent conformation.

    / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
    let !d self assert = Binding of ACE2 to bat virus and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins:. Amplitude analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 S binds approximately 1,000 times more tightly to ACE2 than the bat virus protein does, with Kd values of <100 nM and >40 μM, respectively.

    / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
    let !e self assert = Structural comparison also suggests another substitution that likely contributes to the greatly enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S binding to ACE2: Gln493 of S makes a potential hydrogen bond with Glu35 of ACE2, which forms an intramolecular salt bridge with Lys31; in turn, ACE2 Lys31 forms a salt bridge with S Glu484. In contrast, the residue equivalent to SARS-CoV-2 Gln493 in the bat virus S is a tyrosine that is unlikely to bond to ACE2 Glu35, and SARS-CoV-2 Glu484 is replaced by a threonine that would not bond to ACE2 Lys31 (Fig. 3c). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 Gln498 is replaced by a Tyr498 that cannot form a hydrogen bond to ACE2 Tyr41.

A haplotype of such length could be due to positive selection, to an unusually low recombination rate in the region, or to that the haplotype entered the human population by gene flow from Neandertals or Denisovans that occurred some 40,000 to 60,000 years ago.

Four of these variants occur the “Altai” as well as in the Chagyrskaya 8 Neandertals, both of whom come from the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia and are ~120,000 and ~50,000 years old, respectively while none occur in the Denisovan genome.

  # pangolian as intermediate host doubt,pangolins and other trafficked animals should continue to be considered as carriers of infectious viruses
  // Single source of pangolin CoVs with a near identical Spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.184374

    head = Our analysis points out that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. and MP789 by Liu et al., were built primarily using the same metagenomic dataset published by Liu et al. in 2019. There is as yet no direct evidence of pangolins being an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, we would like to reinforce that pangolins and other trafficked animals should continue to be considered as carriers of infectious viruses with the potential to transmit into humans.

    >>> Abstract
      Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a nearly identical Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this single batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data.

    let !a self assert = The Guangdong pangolin CoV, obtained from a batch of 21 smuggled pangolins in Guangdong province in March, 2019, was originally described in October, 2019 by Liu et al. Viruses. Since then, Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, Xiao et al. Nature, Zhang et al. Current Biology, and Lam et al. Nature have each analyzed CoV sequences from this same batch of pangolins. In addition, Lam et al. describe CoVs from another batch of smuggled pangolins in Guangxi province; however, these Guangxi pangolin CoVs do not share such a high level of Spike RBD identity (only 86-87% amino acid identity) with SARS-CoV-2.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !b self assert = During this process, we were surprised to find that Xiao et al. assembled their genome GD_1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) primarily using the Liu et al. Viruses metagenomic dataset (NCBI SRA BioProject: PRJNA573298). In their paper, Xiao et al. identified the PRJNA573298 dataset as a source of contigs from pangolin viral metagenomes that mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Yet, Xiao et al. cite Liu et al. Viruses in their article as follows: “SARSr-CoV sequences were previously detected in dead Malayan pangolins (reference 15: Liu et al. Viruses). These sequences appear to be from Pangolin-CoV identified in the present study judged by their sequence similarity.” Given that Xiao et al. relied on the 2019 dataset by Liu et al. Viruses to generate their genome sequence, it is curious that it was not clear to Xiao et al. from the beginning that they were studying the same pangolin CoV.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !c self assert = Xiao et al. renamed pangolin samples first published by Liu et al. Viruses without citing their study as the original article that described these samples, and used the metagenomic data from these samples in their analysis. To compound this issue, Xiao et al. used an inconsistent definition of “total reads” in the description of the samples in their Extended Data Table 3, which made it challenging to match the samples with those from Liu et al. Viruses.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !d self assert = For samples M1 and M6, Xiao et al. counted the number of sequenced fragments in the library, which corresponds to their stated library size. For the remaining samples, Xiao et al. counted the number of sequenced reads (two reads per fragment in paired-end Illumina libraries); Supplementary Table 1 shows that the “total reads” for these samples are double the library size. We were only able to match the pangolin samples from Liu et al. Viruses with those used inXiao et al.’s analysis after becoming aware of this inconsistency. Samples lung02, lung07, lung08, and lung11 published by Liu et al. Viruses were identified as M3, M2, M4, and M8, respectively, in Xiao et al. Nature.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !e self assert = The sample lung08, first analyzed by Liu et al. Viruses, was a major source of metagenomic reads spanning the entire pangolin CoV genome. The only sample from Xiao et al., out of the samples that we could not match to those from the Liu et al. dataset, that contributed a considerable number of reads was pangolin_9 (sample M1). However, most of the pangolin_9/M1 reads map onto a single region in Orf1a.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !f self assert = When the reads from samples lung08 and pangolin_9 are combined, the resulting read coverage and alignment profile looks highly similar to the sample read profile in Xiao et al.’s; it was not specified which of their seven samples with CoV sequence reads was described by this figure. The reads from lung08 and pangolin_9 inform the large part of the metagenomic read profile when all samples are merged.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !g self assert = In addition, for the Spike RBD, the majority of the metagenomic sequence data are derived from lung08 (even so, the read depth was low). Xiao et al.’s sequences, from samples that we could not match to those from Liu et al. Viruses, do not cover the Spike receptor binding motif which encompasses residues that are critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Although Xiao et al. sequenced the full Spike gene from six PCR-positive pangolin samples, the sequence data spanning the RBD have not been made available aside from the final genome sequence of GD_1.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !h self assert = To add to the challenge of evaluating the genome sequence accuracy, at the time of this writing on May 25, 2020, we were unable to find the sequences from Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens and Xiao et al. Nature that were used to fill the numerous gaps in their genomes. This prevents independent reconstruction of these genomes.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !i self assert = Briefly, each group first assembled their genome by pooling sequences across multiple pangolin samples. Xiao et al. justified this approach by explaining that there was only one ‘type’ of coronavirus among the pangolin samples. Similarly, Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens pooled sequences from three pangolins from the Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center: two of 21 pangolins confiscated in March, 2019 as described in Liu et al. Viruses, 4 and one of six pangolins confiscated in July, 2019.1 Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens commented that the July sequences were less abundant than the March sequences, and have not made these sequences available.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !j self assert = At the time of writing on May 25, 2020, we could not find a pangolin CoV genome dataset with the accession 2312773 as was provided in the Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens Data Availability statement (the article was published on May 14, 2020). We have queried NCBI databases as well as the China National GeneBank Database (https://db.cngb.org/). It is ultimately unclear which parts of the Liu et al. pangolin CoV genome MP789 drew from the July sequences. Both groups filled the gaps in their genomes using targeted PCR assays, but have not made these sequences available.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !k self assert = Sequencing errors cannot be distinguished without access to the raw sequencing data, including the gap-filling sequences. As expected, due to their reliance on the same dataset and, very likely, the same pangolin source, the Xiao et al. genome GD_1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) and the Liu et al. genome MP789 (theversion that was updated on May 18, 2020) share 99.95% nucleotide identity.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !l self assert = Based on our analysis, we emphasize that there has only been one confirmed source of pangolin CoVs with a Spike RBD nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV-2: pangolins confiscated from smugglers in Guangdong province in March, 2019.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !m self assert = The Guangdong pangolin CoV analyses by Zhang et al. and Lam et al. also used the Liu et al. Viruses 2019 dataset, and this was clearly stated in their publications. Lam et al. obtained additional March, 2019 smuggled pangolin samples from the Guangzhou Customs Technology Center (NCBI SRA BioProject: PRJNA606875), but only recovered CoV sequences from a single scale sample  and combined this with the Liu et al. Viruses dataset to generate their Guangdong pangolin CoV reference.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !n self assert = If there are batches of Guangdong pangolins other than the smuggled pangolins from March, 2019 that have resulted in similar CoV sequences, particularly at the Spike RBD, we have not been able to locate such data based on the Liu et al. and Xiao et al. publications. In comparison to the Guangdong pangolin CoV, the Guangxi pangolin CoVs described by Lam et al. are less similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the Spike RBD at both the amino acid and nucleotide level even relative to the bat CoV RaTG13 . Of the five critical residues for binding between the SARS-CoV Spike RBD and human ACE2 protein, RaTG13 and the Guangxi pangolin CoVs each share only one residue with SARS-CoV-2, whereas the Guangdong pangolin CoV shares all five residues with SARS-CoV-2.5

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !o self assert = We would like to reiterate the observations from the literature that it remains to be determined whether the Guangdong and Guangxi pangolin CoVs are found in pangolins in the wild. All of the CoV-positive pangolins were confiscated from smugglers and the Guangdong pangolins displayed severe respiratory illness and high mortality (14 of the 17 CoV-positive pangolins died within a 1.5 month interval).

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !p self assert = Xiao et al. did not detect CoVs in a second batch of pangolins (four Malayan and four Chinese pangolins) from the Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center in August, 2019.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !q self assert = During the review of our manuscript, a longitudinal study of 334 pangolins confiscated from smugglers in Malaysia, between 2009 to 2019, was published; none of the pangolins tested positive for Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, or Paramyxoviridae, and the authors similarly hypothesized that pangolins were an incidental host of coronaviruses potentially due to exposure to infected humans and other smuggled animals. It is unclear whether the CoVs were responsible for the respiratory illness observed in the Guangdong pangolins, and to what extent the post-mortem samples from pangolins that died after extensive rescue efforts can be relied upon for virus detection.

    / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !r self assert =  In the scenario where only smuggled pangolins possess these CoVs, the CoVs could have come from other species held in captivity given the potentially broad host tropism of the related SARS-CoV2 spike7–9 and the fact that each group of smuggled pangolins carried a single CoV strain. For instance, a Hong Kong smuggling bust in 2014 discovered 40 boxes of pangolin and masked palm civet meat (palm civets were the intermediate host of SARS-CoV, 2002-2004). In February, 2019, ~30 tons of pangolin, including 61 live pangolins, alongside bat carcasses were raided in Kota Kinabalu.  Which other species were found in the Guangdong and Guangxi anti-smuggling raids, and could these or the human smugglers be hosts of similar CoVs?

    head = Identifies 13 known drugs which harbour the viral replications with known dose effect relationships.

    >>> Abstract
      The emergence of the novel SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic of severe pneumonia-like disease designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. The development of a vaccine is likely to require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a novel antiviral therapeutic can exceed 10 years. Thus, repurposing of known drugs could significantly accelerate the deployment of novel therapies for COVID-19. Towards this end, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. We report the identification of 100 molecules that inhibit viral replication, including 21 known drugs that exhibit dose response relationships. Of these, thirteen were found to harbor effective concentrations likely commensurate with achievable therapeutic doses in patients, including the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod2–4, and the cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334, and apilimod were found to antagonize viral replication in human iPSC-derived pneumocyte-like cells, and the PIKfyve inhibitor also demonstrated antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model. Since most of the molecules identified in this study have already advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will enable accelerated preclinical and clinical evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

    >>> Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, has spread rapidly worldwide, and information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols) between ferrets, 1 to 3 days and 3 to 7 days after exposure respectively. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets is similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus is isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets are productively infected via either route. This study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings.

    >>> Abstract
      A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the winter of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread around the world. The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21st Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4C, 22C, and 37C). Stability was evaluated at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22C and for at least 8h at 37C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4C while viable virus was not detected on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22C and 4 h at 37C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency with the virus being detected for at least 96 h at 4C and at least 4 h at 22C. No viable virus was detected on clothing samples at 37C after initial exposure. This study confirms the inverse relationship between virus stability and temperature. Furthermore, virus stability on skin demonstrates the need for continued hand hygiene practices to minimize fomite transmission both in the general population as well as workplaces where close contact is common.

    >>> Abstract
      Abstract In March 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With >8.8 million cases and >450,000 deaths reported globally, a vaccine is urgently needed. We report the available safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose escalation study among healthy adults, 18-55 years of age, randomized to receive 2 doses, separated by 21 days, of 10 μg, 30 μg, or 100 μg of BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified, mRNA vaccine that encodes trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RBD. Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 1.8- to 2.8-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate.

    let !c self assert = Robust immunogenicity was observed after vaccination with BNT162b1. RBD-binding IgG concentrations were detected at 21 days after the first dose and substantially increased 7 days after the second dose given at Day 21. After the first dose, the RBD-binding IgG GMCs (10 µg dose recipients) were similar to those observed in a panel of 38 convalescent, human serology samples obtained at least 14 days after PCR-confirmed following SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 asymptomatic donors. Post-dose 1 GMCs were similar to those of the 30 µg and 100 µg groups but substantially higher than those in the convalescent serum panel. After Dose 2 with 10 µg or 30 µg BNT162b1, the RBD-binding IgG GMCs were ~8.0-fold to ~50-fold that of the convalescent serum panel GMC.

    let !d self assert = Neutralization titers were measurable after a single vaccination at Day 21 for all dose levels. At Day 28 (7 days after Dose 2), substantial SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were observed. The virus neutralizing GMTs after the 10 µg and 30 µg Dose 2 were, respectively, 1.8-fold and 2.8- fold the GMT of the convalescent serum panel. Assuming that neutralization titers induced by natural infection provide protection from COVID-19 disease, comparing vaccine-induced SARSCoV-2 neutralization titers to those from sera of convalescent humans quantifies the magnitude of the vaccine-elicited response and the vaccine’s potential to provide protection

    / July, 2020 - medRxiv
    let !e self assert = Since the 100 µg dose level cohort was not boosted, no corresponding data for immunogenicity after a second vaccination are available however there were no substantial differences in immunogenicity between the 30 µg and 100 µg dose levels after Dose 1. This observation suggests that a well tolerated and immunogenic dose level may be between 10 µg and 30 µg for this vaccine candidate.

    head = Overall, this was a well-conducted, well-designed, practice-changing clinical trial providing the most convincing evidence to date of an efficacious treatment in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. However, there are a number of issues, primarily around the reporting of the trial, that should ideally be resolved prior to final publication. We also urge caution against over-interpreting the estimated subgroup-specific effects based on level of respiratory support, especially the suggestion of harm in the group not on oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

    let !a self assert = Prior to the completion of this trial, many COVID-19 treatment guidelines have stated thatcorticosteroids are either ‘contraindicated’ or ‘not recommended’ in COVID-19.19 These shouldnow be updated, as has already happened within the UK.27 Dexamethasone provides aneffective treatment for the sickest patients with COVID-19 and, given its low cost, wellunderstood safety profile, and widespread availability, is one that can be used worldwide.
