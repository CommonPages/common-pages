Using correlative analyses, we observed relationships between features of the different immunotypes, patient comorbidities, and clinical features of COVID-19 disease. By integrating ∼200 immune features with extensive clinical data, disease severity scores, and temporal changes, we were able to build an integrated computational model that connected patient immune response phenotype to disease severity.

    >>> Abstract
      COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. Immune dysregulation has been implicated, but immune responses remain poorly understood. We analyzed 71 COVID-19 patients compared to recovered and healthy subjects using high dimensional cytometry. Integrated analysis of ∼200 immune and >30 clinical features revealed activation of T cell and B cell subsets, but only in some patients. A subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses could reach >30% of circulating B cells. However, another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable to uninfected subjects. Stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to trajectories of disease severity change. These analyses identified three “immunotypes” associated with poor clinical trajectories versus improving health. These immunotypes may have implications for therapeutics and vaccines.

Many COVID-19 patients displayed robust CD8 T cell and/or CD4 T cell activation and proliferation, though a considerable subgroup of patients (∼1/3) had no detectable response compared to controls. B cell responses were also heterogeneous and, in some patients, PB responses were >30% of B cells whereas, in other patients, PB were undetectable above controls.

The lack of relationship between these two cell types in this disease could be due to T cell-independent B cell responses, lack of activated cTfh in peripheral blood at this time point, or lower CXCR5 expression observed across lymphocyte populations, making it more difficult to identify cTfh.

    head = The one factor that emerges for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and implementation is reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) to lengthen the incubation period, reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus.

    >>> Abstract
      Vaccines for 17 viral pathogens have been licensed for use in humans. Previously, two critical biological parameters of the pathogen and the host–pathogen interaction—incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity—were proposed to account for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and to be useful in estimating the “certainty of success” of developing an effective vaccine for viral pathogens for which a vaccine currently does not exist. In considering the “certainty of success” in development of human coronavirus vaccines, particularly SARS-CoV-2, a third, related critical parameter is proposed—infectious inoculum intensity, at an individual-level, and force of infection, at a population-level. Reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) is predicted to lengthen the incubation period, which in turn is predicted to reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus. Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the “certainty of success” of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself.

  ref 'Viner_et_al_05_24_2020
    head = Data from contact-tracing studies suggest there is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis of these studies found the pooled odds ratio for testing positive in children compared with adults was 0.44 (0.29, 0.69), meaning those under approximately age 18-20 years had a 56% lower odds of infection than adults.

    >>> Background
      The degree to which children and young people are infected by and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus is unclear. Clinical series and testing cohorts based upon screening of symptomatic cases provide biased estimates of susceptibility in children. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour.

    >>> Methods
      We undertook a rapid systematic review of contact-tracing studies and population-screening studies to address the question What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults? We searched PubMed and medRxiv on 16 May 2020 and identified 6327 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references (2) and professional contacts (4). We assessed quality, summarized findings and undertook a random effects meta-analysis of contact-tracing studies.

    >>> Results
      18 studies met inclusion criteria; 9 contact-tracing, 8 population-screening and 1 systematic-review. Meta-analysis of contact tracing studies showed that the pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults for all contact tracing studies was 0.44 (0.29, 0.69) with substantial heterogeneity (63%). Findings from a systematic review of household clusters of COVID-19 found 3/31 (10%) were due to a child index case and a population-based school contact tracing study found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and not suitable for meta-analysis. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and an Italian municipal study showed markedly lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence amongst children and young people, however studies from Stockholm, England and municipalities in Switzerland and Germany showed showed no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children.

    >>> Conclusions
      There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 56% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.

The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes.

    >>> Background
      Progressive respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19.

    >>> Methods
      We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro–computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression.

    >>> Results
      In patients who died from Covid-19–associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth — predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis — was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).

    >>> Conclusion
      In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection. The universality and clinical implications of our observations require further research to define. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)

    >>> Abstract
      Identifying the exact transmission route(s) of infectious diseases in indoor environments is a crucial step in developing effective intervention strategies. In this study, we proposed a comparative analysis approach and built a model to simulate outbreaks of 3 different in-flight infections in a similar cabin environment, that is, influenza A H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), and norovirus. The simulation results seemed to suggest that the close contact route was probably the most significant route (contributes 70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%-72%) in the in-flight transmission of influenza A H1N1 transmission; as a result, passengers within 2 rows of the index case had a significantly higher infection risk than others in the outbreak (relative risk [RR]: 13.4, 95% CI: 1.5-121.2, P = .019). For SARS CoV, the airborne, close contact, and fomite routes contributed 21% (95% CI: 19%-23%), 29% (95% CI: 27%-31%), and 50% (95% CI: 48%-53%), respectively. For norovirus, the simulation results suggested that the fomite route played the dominant role (contributes 85%, 95% CI: 83%-87%) in most cases; as a result, passengers in aisle seats had a significantly higher infection risk than others (RR: 9.5, 95% CI: 1.2-77.4, P = .022).

    head = Significant variation of viral loading with the aerosol source region is likely, because pathogens tend to colonize specific regions of the respiratory tract and because the ratio of tissue surface to respiratory tract lining fluid volume varies throughout the respiratory tract.

    >>> Abstract
      An essential starting point when investigating the potential role of human expired aerosols in the transmission of disease is to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the expired aerosol generation process, including the aerosol size distribution, the various droplet production mechanisms involved and the corresponding sites of production within the respiratory tract. In order to approach this level of understanding we have integrated the results of two different investigative techniques spanning 3 decades of particle size from 700 nm to 1 mm, presenting a single composite size distribution, and identifying the most prominent modes in that distribution. We link these modes to specific sites of origin and mechanisms of production. The data for this were obtained using the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) covering the range 0.7≤d≤20 μm and Droplet Deposition Analysis (DDA) covering the range d≥20 μm.
      In the case of speech three distinct droplet size distribution modes were identified with count median diameters at 1.6, 2.5 and 145 μm. In the case of voluntary coughing the modes were located at 1.6, 1.7 and 123 μm. The modes are associated with three distinct processes: one occurring deep in the lower respiratory tract, another in the region of the larynx and a third in the upper respiratory tract including the oral cavity. The first of these, the Bronchiolar Fluid Film Burst (BFFB or B) mode contains droplets produced during normal breathing. The second, the Laryngeal (L) mode is most active during voicing and coughing. The third, the Oral (O) cavity mode is active during speech and coughing. The number of droplets and the volume of aerosol material associated with each mode of aerosol production during speech and coughing is presented. The size distribution is modeled as a tri-modal lognormal distribution dubbed the Bronchiolar/Laryngeal/Oral (B.L.O.) tri-modal model.

Transfer efficiency with a smooth plastic surface for both gloved and un-gloved hands was higher than current literature suggests.

    >>> Abstract
      Bacterial transmission from contaminated surfaces via hand contact plays a critical role in disease spread. However, the fomite‐to‐finger transfer efficiency of microorganisms during multiple sequential surface contacts with and without gloves has not been formerly investigated.
      We measured the quantity of Escherichia coli on fingertips of participants after one‐to‐eight sequential contacts with inoculated plastic coupons with and without nitrile gloves. A Bayesian approach was used to develop a mechanistic model of pathogen accretion to examine finger loading as a function of the difference between E. coli on surfaces and fingers. We used the model to determine the coefficient of transfer efficiency (λ), and influence of swabbing efficiency and finger area.
      Results showed λ for bare skin was higher (49%, 95%CI=32‐72%) than for gloved hands (30%, CI=17‐49%). Microbial load tended towards a dynamic equilibrium after four and six contacts for gloved hands and bare skin, respectively. Individual differences between volunteers’ hands had a negligible effect compared with use of gloves (p <0.01). Gloves reduced loading by 4.7% (CI=‐12%‐21%) over bare skin contacts whilst 20% of participants accrued more microorganisms on gloved hands. This was due to poor fitting, which created a larger finger surface area than bare hands.

    head = Environmental sampling may result in earlier detection of an (re-)emerging virus than the current practice relying on human specimens availed only after very sick patients start to report to clinics.

    >>> Abstract
      The progression of COVID-19 worldwide can be tracked by identifying mutations within the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that occur as a function of time. Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L–1 air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable (‘live’), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample. The complete SAR-CoV-2 genomic sequence was nevertheless determined by Sanger sequencing and most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously described in Georgia, USA. Results of this study illustrate the feasibility of tracking progression of the COVID-19 pandemic using environmental aerosol samples instead of human specimens. Collection of a positive sample from a distance more than 2 m away from the nearest patient traffic implies the virus was in an aerosol.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b04846
  ref 'Lin_et_al_01_26_2017
    head = These results show that toilets, aeration basins, and converging flows in sewer systems can generate aerosolized viruses to varying extents. While toilets generate a large number of aerosols, the total volume of liquid aerosolized is extremely small, so the chance of aerosolizing viruses upon flushing is expected to be low.

    >>> Abstract
      Recent studies have shown that Ebola virus can persist in wastewater. We evaluated the potential for Ebola virus surrogates to be aerosolized from three types of wastewater systems: toilets, a lab-scale model of an aeration basin, and a lab-scale model of converging sewer pipes. We measured the aerosol size distribution generated by each system, spiked Ebola virus surrogates (MS2 and Phi6) into each system, and determined the emission rate of viruses into the air. The number of aerosols released ranged from 105 to 107 per flush from the toilets or per minute from the lab-scale models, and the total volume of aerosols generated by these systems was ∼10–9 to 10–7 mL per flush or per minute in all cases. MS2 and Phi6, spiked into toilets at an initial concentration of 107 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU mL–1), were not detected in air after flushing. Airborne concentrations of MS2 and Phi6 were ∼20 PFU L–1 and ∼0.1 PFU L–1, respectively, in the chambers enclosing the aeration basin and sewer models. The corresponding emission rates of MS2 and Phi6 were 547 PFU min–1 and 3.8 PFU min–1, respectively, for the aeration basin and 79 PFU min–1 and 0.3 PFU min–1 for the sewer pipes.

    >>> Background
      The potential risks associated with "toilet plume" aerosols produced by flush toilets is a subject of continuing study. This review examines the evidence regarding toilet plume bioaerosol generation and infectious disease transmission.

    >>> Methods
      The peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched to identify articles related to aerosol production during toilet flushing, as well as epidemiologic studies examining the potential role of toilets in infectious disease outbreaks.

    >>> Results
      The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.

    >>> Conclusion
      Research suggests that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities.

    >>> Abstract
      During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.

  ref 'Mehra_et_al_05_22_2020
    head = Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19.

    >>> Background
      Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit. Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).

    >>> Findings
      96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.

    >>> Interpretation
      We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

Consequently, the previous 3% mortality rate observed in patients with suspected infection and a qSOFA score ≤ 1 is unlikely to be exact in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We anticipate that the qSOFA is not appropriate to identify Covid-19 patient to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis.

    >>> Background
      Hydroxychloroquine has been widely administered to patients with Covid-19 without robust evidence supporting its use.

    >>> Methods
      We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score.

    >>> Results
      Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.

    >>> Conclusions
      In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)

    head = An investigation of COVID-19 outbreaks across four nursing homes in central London identified 103 (26%) fatalities among residents over the two-month period spanning the peak of the London COVID-19 epidemic. These deaths represented a more than two-fold increase compared to the same period in the two previous years, with the increase mostly attributable to three of the four homes investigated.

    >>> Objectives: To understand SARS-Co-V-2 infection and transmission in UK nursing homes in order to develop preventive strategies for protecting the frail elderly residents. Design: An outbreak investigation.
    >>> Setting:
      4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Participants: 394 residents and 70 staff in nursing homes.
    >>> Interventions:
      Two point-prevalence surveys one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality, and mortality attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in residents and staff.
    >>> Results:
      Overall, 26% (95% confidence interval 22 to 31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70 to 336). Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35 to 46) of residents, of whom 43% (95% CI 34 to 52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11 to 24) had atypical symptoms, as well as 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    >>> Conclusions:
      The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was associated with a very high mortality rate in residents of nursing homes. Systematic testing of all residents and a representative sample of staff identified high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity across the four nursing homes, highlighting a potential for regular screening to prevent future outbreaks.

    head =  We have demonstrated that the immunophenotype of COVID-19 and influenza patients vary widely. Two forms of COVID-19 immune dysregulation were observed: a cytokine storm phenotype in a small proportion of patients and a far more common phenotype characterized by targeted immunosuppression.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high incidence of acute respiratory failure. The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.

Countermeasures are needed to treat and prevent further dissemination of the virus. In this study, we report the isolation of 2 specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from a convalescent COVID-19 patient. CA1 and CB6 demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, CB6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus monkeys at both prophylactic and treatment settings. Further structural studies revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct interface-residue competition. Our results suggest CB6 deserves further clinical translation.

    head = The sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient ‘explorers’ of phenotype space. The SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date.

    >>> Abstract
      There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence. Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses – the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 – exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.

    >>> Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 causing a global pandemic, with the United Kingdom (UK) one of the hardest hit countries. Rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 evolves relatively slowly, but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny. To understand these discrepancies, we used veSEQ3, a targeted RNA-seq approach, to quantify minor allele frequencies in 413 clinical samples from two UK locations. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity, which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure. These results were reproducible in data from other sequencing locations around the UK, where we find evidence of mixed infection by major circulating lineages with patterns that cannot readily be explained by artefacts in the data. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 diversity is transmissible, and propose that geographic patterns are generated by co-circulation of distinct viral populations. Co-transmission of mixed populations could open opportunities for resolving clusters of transmission and understanding pathogenesis.

This observation might reflect different opportunities for hospital consultation for individuals with comorbidities, since they are usually considered to be at high risk of adverse outcomes.

    >>> Background
      Information about incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of HIV-infected individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is scarce. We characterised individuals with COVID-19 among a cohort of HIV-infected adults in Madrid.

    >>> Methods
      In this observational prospective study, we included all consecutive HIV-infected individuals (aged ≥18 years) who had suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as of April 30, 2020, at the Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain). We compared the characteristics of HIV-infected individuals with COVID-19 with a sample of HIV-infected individuals assessed before the COVID-19 pandemic, and described the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19.

    >>> Findings
      51 HIV-infected individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 (incidence 1·8%, 95% CI 1·3–2·3). Mean age of patients was 53·3 years (SD 9·5); eight (16%) were women, and 43 (84%) men. 35 (69%) cases of co-infection had laboratory confirmed COVID-19, and 28 (55%) required hospital admission. Age and CD4 cell counts in 51 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were similar to those in 1288 HIV-infected individuals without; however, 32 (63%) with COVID-19 had at least one comorbidity (mostly hypertension and diabetes) compared with 495 (38%) without COVID-19 (p=0·00059). 37 (73%) patients had received tenofovir before COVID-19 diagnosis compared with 487 (38%) of those without COVID-19 (p=0·0036); 11 (22%) in the COVID-19 group had previous protease inhibitor use (mostly darunavir) compared with 175 (14%; p=0·578). Clinical, analytical, and radiological presentation of COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals was similar to that described in the general population. Six (12%) individuals were critically ill, two of whom had CD4 counts of less than 200 cells per µL, and two (4%) died. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR remained positive after a median of 40 days from symptoms onset in six (32%) individuals, four of whom had severe disease or low nadir CD4 cell counts.

    >>> Interpretation
      HIV-infected individuals should not be considered to be protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection or to have lower risk of severe disease. Generally, they should receive the same treatment approach applied to the general population.

Although testing capacity has been limited in many areas of the world, HDSS provide a pre-existing structure in resource-limited settings that is purpose-built for surveillance, with both expertise and infrastructure for conducting population-based surveys

    >>> Abstract
      A coordinated system of disease surveillance will be critical to effectively control the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute’s Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response.
      The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care – conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures. In this protocol we report the details of our cohort design, questionnaires, data and reporting structures, and standard operating procedures in hopes that our project can inform similar efforts elsewhere.

    head = We found high baseline levels of both anxiety and depression, independent of living under a shelter in place or stay at home order. More than half (52.1%) of respondents had at least mild anxiety, and 47.3% of subjects had at least mild depressive symptoms. Adopting the cutoff of 7 on the GAD-7 score for anxiety, as used in a recent study on COVID-19, would yield 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety.

    >>> Abstract
      Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to significant mental health stresses, potentially with modifiable risk factors. To determine the presence of and magnitude of associations between baseline associations and anxiety and depression in the US general population, we performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race- stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) were male. Baseline demographic data were similar between those that were (n=663, 66.2%) and were not (n=339, 33.8%) under a shelter in place/ stay at home order, with the exception of sex and geographic location. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.49, 0.87]) and living in a larger home (OR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]), were associated with increased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. 232 subjects (23.6%) met criteria for clinical depression. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.71, 95% CI [0.53, 0.95]), increased time outdoors (OR 0.51, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92]), and living in a larger home (OR 0.35, 95% CI [0.18, 0.69]), were associated with decreased odds of meeting depression criteria. Having lost a job (OR 1.64, 95% CI [1.05, 2.54]), loneliness (OR 10.42, 95% CI [6.26, 17.36]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.42, 95% CI [1.62, 3.62]), were associated with an increased odds of meeting depression criteria. Income, media consumption, and religiosity were not associated with mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression are common in the US general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are associated with potentially modifiable factors.

The vaccine induced Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in both young and aged mice, an attribute that has been associated with improved recovery and milder disease outcomes in SARS-CoV-infected patients. Together, these results support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for protection from COVID19.

    >>> Abstract
      The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is having a dramatic and deleterious impact on health services and the global economy. Grim public health statistics highlight the need for vaccines that can rapidly confer protection after a single dose and be manufactured using components suitable for scale-up and efficient distribution. In response, we have rapidly developed repRNA-CoV2S, a stable and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate comprised of an RNA replicon formulated with a novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION) designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery and immunogenicity. We show that intramuscular injection of LION/repRNA-CoV2S elicits robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a Type 1 T helper response as well as potent T cell responses in mice. Importantly, a single-dose administration in nonhuman primates elicited antibody responses that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States. Moreover, we find evidence for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different neighborhoods of the city.

Using address-linked testing data we assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among household contacts of these cases.

    >>> Background
      The United States’ COVID-19 epidemic has grown extensively since February 2020, with substantial associated hospitalizations and mortality; New York State (NYS) has emerged as the national epicenter. We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations.

    >>> Methods
      Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case’s households enabled estimation of household prevalence.

    >>> Results
      During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case’s households found prevalent infection among 57%; excluding first-reported cases 38%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among those <5 years to 68% among those ≥65 years (p<.0001).

    >>> Conclusions
      New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.

  ref 'Bert_et_al_2020
    head = Virus-specific memory T cells induced by betacoronanvirus infection are long-lasting, which supports the notion that COVID-19 patients would develop long-term T cell immunity. Furthermore, our findings also raise the intriguing possibility that infection with related viruses can also protect from or modify the pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    >>> Abstract
      Memory T cells induced by previous infections can influence the course of new viral infections. Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to “common cold” human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.
      Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The finding of high ACE2 expression of in central glial substance and brain ventricles suggest two potential novel routes for the SARS-CoV-2 entering the CSF and/or spreading around the brain.

    >>> Abstract
      By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some important brain areas, such as the substantia nigra and brain ventricles. According to our cell-type distribution analysis, the expression of ACE2 were found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, but the ACE2-expressing cells was none in the prefrontal cortex and very few in the hippocampus. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable to result in serious central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

  ref 'Li_et_al_2020f
    head = SARS-CoV-2 has a nearly identical RBM to the one found in the pangolin CoVs from Guangdong. Thus, it is plausible that RaTG13-like bat-CoV viruses may have obtained the RBM sequence binding to human ACE2 through recombination with Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like viruses. We hypothesize that this, and/or other ancestral recombination events between viruses infecting bats and pangolins, may have played a key role in the evolution of the strain that lead to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into humans.

    >>> Abstract
      COVID-19 has become a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis, discovering new drugs, and developing a vaccine. We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike and other genes among bat, pangolin, and human coronaviruses, suggesting similar evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2’s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2’s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species, together with frequent recombination among coronaviruses, suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.

    head = Our study utilized a crosssectional approach to correlate COVID-19 symptom onset to specimen collection with SARS-CoV-2 E gene RT-PCR and virus viability as determined by cell culture.

    >>> Background
      RT-PCR has become the primary method to diagnose viral diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions. Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines.

    >>> Results
      Ninety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells. Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth. Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511). There was no growth in samples with a Ct > 24 or STT > 8 days. Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds ratio for positive viral culture of 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.84, p<0.001) for every one unit increase in Ct. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Ct vs. positive culture was OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97, p<0.001), with 97% specificity obtained at a Ct of >24.

    >>> Conclusions
      SARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct < 24 and STT < 8 days. Infectivity of patients with Ct >24 and duration of symptoms >8 days may be low. This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions. Further studies of larger size are needed.

    >>> Abstract
      The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to contrast the disease. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible to those observed in the transcriptomic data. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.

In addition, 19 of the 31 identified mutations are novel, despite the relatively early sampling dates, indicating that the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated.

    >>> Abstract
      The sudden outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally with more than 1,300,000 patients diagnosed and a death toll of 70,000. Current genomic survey data suggest that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are abundant. However, no mutation has been directly linked with functional changes in viral pathogenicity. Here we report functional characterizations of 11 patient-derived viral isolates, all of which have at least one mutation. Importantly, these viral isolates show significant variation in cytopathic effects and viral load, up to 270-fold differences, when infecting Vero-E6 cells. We observed intrapersonal variation and 6 different mutations in the spike glycoprotein (S protein), including 2 different SNVs that led to the same missense mutation. Therefore, we provide direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity.

  ref 'Ju_et_al_2020
    head = Viral species-specific responses identified in patients suggest that these RBDs are immunologically distinct. If so, interventions must target each viral species differently to achieve maximum efficacy. Our findings somewhat answer why many previously isolated SARS-CoV antibodies fail to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite detectable binding with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

    >>> Abstract
      The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a global health emergency in urgent need of interventions1–3. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the target cells depends on binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the ACE2 cell receptor2,4–6. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We identified antibodies with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity that correlates with their competitive capacity with ACE2 for RBD binding. Surprisingly, neither the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBDs, although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric Spike proteins was found. Crystal structure analysis of RBD-bound antibody revealed steric hindrance that inhibits viral engagement with ACE2 and thereby blocks viral entry. These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are viral species-specific inhibitors. The antibodies identified here may be candidates for the development of SARS-CoV-2 clinical interventions.

    >>> Abstract
      The respective roles of high pressure and high tidal volume to promote high airway pressure pulmonary edema are unclear. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was shown to reduce lung water content in this type of edema, but its possible effects on cellular lesions were not documented. We compared the consequences of normal tidal volume ventilation in mechanically ventilated rats at a high airway pressure (HiP-LoV) with those of high tidal volume ventilation at a high (HiP-HiV) or low (LoP-HiV) airway pressure and the effects of PEEP (10 cm H2O) on both edema and lung ultrastructure. Pulmonary edema was assessed by extravascular lung water content and microvascular permeability by the drug lung weight and the distribution space of 125I-labeled albumin. HiP-LoV rat lungs were not different from those of controls (7 cm H2O peak pressure ventilation). By contrast, the lungs from the groups submitted to high volume ventilation had significant permeability type edema. This edema was more pronounced in LoP-HiV rats. It was markedly reduced by PEEP, which, in addition, preserved the normal ultrastructural aspect of the alveolar epithelium. This was in striking contrast to the diffuse alveolar damage usually encountered in this type of edema. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example of a protective effect of PEEP during permeability edema.

    head = Prolonged ventilation is associated with lung injury, infection, and multi-organ system dysfunction and if these may, even in part, be attributable to the physiological derangements described, then the real cost of ventilation, or oxygenation, is and has always been higher than was realized.

    >>> Abstract
      Positive pressure ventilation is a radical departure from the physiology of breathing spontaneously. The immediate physiological consequences of positive pressure ventilation such as haemodynamic changes are recognized, studied, and understood. There are other significant physiological interactions which are less obvious, more insidious, and may only produce complications if ventilation is prolonged. The interaction of positive pressure with airway resistance and alveolar compliance affects distribution of gas flow within the lung. The result is a wide range of ventilation efficacy throughout different areas of the lung, but the pressure differentials between alveolus and interstitium also influence capillary perfusion. The hydrostatic forces across the capillaries associated with the effects of raised venous pressures compound these changes resulting in interstitial fluid sequestration. This is increased by impaired lymphatic drainage which is secondary to raised intrathoracic pressure but also influenced by raised central venous pressure. Ventilation and PEEP promulgate further physiological derangement. In theory, avoiding these physiological disturbances in a rested lung may be better for the lung and other organs. An alternative to positive pressure ventilation might be to investigate oxygen supplementation of a physiologically neutral and rested lung. Abandoning heroic ventilation would be a massive departure from current practice but might be a more rationale approach to future practice.

  ref 'Howard_et_al_2020
    head = Our review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission: non-medical masks use materials that obstruct droplets of the necessary size; people are most infectious in the initial period post-infection, where it is common to have few or no symptoms; non-medical masks have been effective in reducing transmission of influenza; and places and time periods where mask usage is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.

    >>> Abstract
      The science around the use of masks by the general public to impede COVID-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. Policymakers need guidance on how masks should be used by the general population to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here,we develop an analytical framework to examine an overlooked aspect of mask usage: masks as source-control targeting egress from the wearer with benefits at the population-level, rather than as PPE used for ingress control for health-care workers with focus on individual outcomes. We consider and synthesize the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: 1) transmission characteristics of COVID-19, 2) filtering characteristics and efficacy of masks, 3) estimated population impacts of widespread community mask use, and 4) sociological considerations for policies concerning mask-wearing. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is likely via respiratory droplets, and is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: first, limit contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures, and second, reduce the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Given the current shortages of medical masks we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control for now, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.

    >>> Background
      Concern about the health impact of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in widespread enforced reductions in people’s movement (“lockdowns”). However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these “exit strategies” entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures.

    >>> Methods
      We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database.

    >>> Results
      We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe.

      We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.

A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R0 and k (95% CrIs: R0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution.

    >>> Background
      A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others.

    >>> Methods
      We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution.

    >>> Results
      Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%).

    >>> Conclusions
      Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.

      Understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is important for vaccine development, interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis, and calibration of pandemic control measures. Using HLA class I and II predicted peptide ‘‘megapools,’’ circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified in 70% and 100% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively. CD4+ T cell responses to spike, the main target of most vaccine efforts, were robust and correlated with the magnitude of the antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titers. The M, spike, and N proteins each accounted for 11%–27% of the total CD4+ response, with additional responses commonly targeting nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a, and ORF8, among others. For CD8+ T cells, spike and M were recognized, with at least eight SARS-CoV-2 ORFs targeted. Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in 40%–60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting crossreactive T cell recognition between circulating ‘‘common cold’’ coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.

These data suggest that a candidate COVID-19 vaccine consisting only of SARSCoV-2 spike would be capable of eliciting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses of similar representation to that of natural COVID-19 disease, but the data also indicate that there are many potential CD4+ T cell targets in SARS-CoV-2, and inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 structural antigens such as M and N would better mimic the natural SARS-CoV2-specific CD4+ T cell response observed in mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.

SARS-CoV-2 M was just as strongly recognized, and significant reactivity was noted for other antigens, mostly nsp6, ORF3a, and N, which comprised nearly 50% of the total CD8+ T cell response, on average. Thus, these data indicate that candidate COVID-19 vaccines endeavoring to elicit CD8+ T cell responses against the spike protein will be eliciting a relatively narrow CD8+ T cell response compared to the natural CD8+ T cell response observed in mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.

CD4+ T cell responses were detected in 40%–60% of unexposed individuals. This may be reflective of some degree of cross-reactive, preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in some, but not all, individuals.

In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein.

    >>> Abstract
      Memory T cells induced by previous infections can influence the course of new viral infections. Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to “common cold” human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.
      Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

  ref 'Braun_et_al_2020
    head = Our study demonstrates the presence of S-reactive CD4+ 161 T cells in COVID-19 patients, and in  a subset of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HD. In light of the very recent emergence of SARS CoV-2, our data raise the intriguing possibility that pre-existing S-reactive T cells in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HD represent cross-reactive clones raised against S-proteins, probably acquired as a result of previous exposure to HCoV.

    >>> Abstract
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a rapidly unfolding pandemic, overwhelming health care systems worldwide1. Clinical manifestations of Corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death2, yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown. Also, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogenesis remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002/03), however, CD4+ T cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes3,4, while cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been investigated. Here we describe an assay that allows direct detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. We demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors, albeit at lower frequencies. Strikingly, in COVID-19 patients S-reactive CD4+ T cells equally targeted both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of S whereas in healthy donors S-reactive CD4+ T cells reacted almost exclusively to the Cterminal part that is a) characterized by higher homology to spike glycoprotein of human endemic "common cold" coronaviruses, and b) contains the S2 subunit of S with the cytoplasmic peptide (CP), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) but not the receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-reactive CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co-expressed higher levels of CD38 and HLA-DR, indicating their recent in vivo activation. Our study is the first to directly measure SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing, in depth epitope mapping and characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective cohort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a correlate of protection or pathology. Results of such studies will be key for a mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adaptation of containment methods and to support vaccine development.

  // OpenSAFELY: factors associated with COVID-19-related hospital death in the linked electronic health records of 17 million adult NHS patients.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999
  ref 'Williamson_et_al_2020
    head =  Most comorbidities we studied were associated with increased risk, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease including asthma, obesity, history of haematological malignancy or recent other cancer, kidney, liver, neurological and autoimmune conditions. People from Asian and black groups had a substantially higher risk of death from COVID-19, only partially attributable to co-morbidity, deprivation or other risk factors. Deprivation is also a major risk factor, which was only partly attributable to co-morbidity or other risk factors.

    >>> Background
      Establishing who is at risk from a novel rapidly arising cause of death, and why, requires a new approach to epidemiological research with very large datasets and timely data. Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary.
    >>> Data sources
      Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform.
    >>> Population
      17,425,445 adults.
    >>> Time period
      1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020.
    >>> Primary outcome
      Death in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19.
    >>> Methods
      Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings.
    >>> Results
      There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82).
    >>> Conclusions
      We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients' records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

  # Serology Surveys
  // Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children visiting a hospital during the initial Seattle outbreak
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.20114124
  ref 'Dingens_et_al_2020
    head = We used serological assays to retrospectively identify SARS-CoV-2 infections in children early in the Seattle outbreak. Although our study used sera collected from children seeking medical care and therefore does not represent an unbiased population survey, it nonetheless represents the first large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serological survey of children. In particular, seropositivity increased markedly from March to April of 2020, and most seropositive children had never tested positive for virus. However, the overall frequency of seropositivity was low (»1%) even in April, suggesting that while infections of children are often missed by viral testing perhaps due to the lack of symptoms, only a small fraction of children in Seattle had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of April 2020.

    >>> Abstract
      Children are strikingly underrepresented in COVID-19 case counts. In the United States, children represent 22% of the population but only 1.7% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. One possibility is that symptom-based viral testing is less likely to identify infected children, since they often experience milder disease than adults. To better assess the frequency of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, we serologically screened 1,775 residual samples from Seattle Children's Hospital collected from 1,076 children seeking medical care during March and April of 2020. Only one child was seropositive in March, but nine were seropositive in April for a period seroprevalence of >1%. Most seropositive children (8/10) were not suspected of having had COVID-19. The sera of most seropositive children had neutralizing activity, including one that neutralized at a dilution >1:18,000. Therefore, among children seeking medical care, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased markedly during the early Seattle outbreak despite few positive viral tests.

    head = We found an acute inflammatory immune response characterized by infiltrating monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, as well as activated T and NK cells. We also found gene signatures of acute ISG response which clusters most closely with type I interferon response. In addition to the acute inflammatory response, these mice develop rapid SARS-CoV2 S-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies between 4- and 7- DPI.

    >>> Abstract
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 5,000,000 cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with significant fatality rate. Due to the urgency of this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary safety and efficacy studies. Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S) protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.

We found that although the speed of the drops ranged 2–7 m/s at the start of the cough, the visible large drops (typically 500 μm in diameter) do not travel far before their trajectory bends down due to gravity to rapidly fall onto the ground within 1 s.

To suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we believe health-care authorities should consider the recommendation to avoid poorly ventilated public spaces as much as possible.

      As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated. However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown.

This could be also probably because the patient did not have significant cough and had little amount of spontaneous sputum insufficient for testing.

  # epidemic, USA, illness severity-correlates to infectivity, close contact
  // First mildly ill, non-hospitalized case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without viral transmission in the United States—Maricopa County, Arizona,
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa374
  ref 'Scott_et_al_2020
    head = We summarize the public health investigation, contact tracing, and serial SARS-CoV-2 testing results of the first mildly ill, non-hospitalized U.S. case of COVID-19. Among 16 identified contacts, 10 with high-risk contact did not demonstrate viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on serial SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 6 contacts who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 did not develop any symptom consistent with COVID-19 during post-exposure symptom monitoring. Notably, 1 contact had intimate contact with the case for >36 hours while his clinical specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild illness with a relatively high viral load, and not transmit the infection to close contacts. This case investigation suggests COVID-19 illness severity could correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

    >>> Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity. Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China.

    >>> Methods
      The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (≥10 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Results
      Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), ≥1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative.

    >>> Conclusions
      This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.

His cough was unchanged in character, frequency, and severity at any time during the illness. He denied all additional symptoms, including fever, chills, and shortness of breath. After diagnostic specimen collection on January 22, the case had paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 different time points. In 8 pairs (73%) the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen tested positive or indeterminate; 3 (27%) tested negative.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert = The initial respiratory specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 1 had relatively low Ct values (26.7–28.1 in the oropharyngeal specimen and 31.7–32.8 in the sputum specimen), which suggest higher levels of virus in these specimens, despite the patient’s mild illness. Ct values in specimens collected after symptom resolution, on illnessdays 12, 14, 16, 18, and 22, were >35, suggesting decreasing levels of virus in these specimens.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = On February 5, the patient reported his cough had resolved. On February 19, 14 days after symptom resolution, CDC confirmed the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at 2 consecutive time points ≥24 hours apart and he was released from voluntary isolation.

    let !d self assert = Sixteen contacts were identified. Eleven (69%) had high-risk exposure: 5 rideshare drivers, 3 healthcare personnel, 2 housemates, and 1 intimate contact. Five (31%) healthcare personnel had medium-risk exposure. The intimate contact had stayed with the patient for >36 hours before positive diagnostic testing results were received. All 35 paired specimens (100%) collected from contacts with high-risk exposure tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. On February 3, after the intimate contact’s first specimen tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the intimate contact was placed in voluntary quarantine in separate housing to prevent possible ongoing exposure

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !e self assert =  This investigation demonstrates that a mildly symptomatic individual can have a relatively high viral load and still not transmit the infection to an intimate contact. The case had repeated intimate contact with one person over >36 hours while testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case differs from cases reported in Chicago, Illinois and San Benito County, California, where viral transmission occurred between intimate contacts prior to diagnosis and index cases had more severe illnesses, requiring hospitalization. We hypothesize this could be because the virus is nonviable, but this cannot be confirmed without viral culture data.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !f self assert = Of 16 contacts, 3 (19%) developed a cough during the 14-day post-exposure monitoring period and were considered “persons under investigation” per CDC guidance until clinical specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. By March 5, all 16 contacts completed 14-day post-exposure symptom monitoring periods.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa351
  ref 'Xu_et_al_2020b
    head = This study is the first to document the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the respiratory tract among a cohort of patients with COVID-19. We found that the median duration from onset of symptoms to RNA clearance was 17 days. Male sex, delayed hospital admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. These results reinforce guidance that hospital admission and treatments should be started as soon as possible in patients with COVID-19. Male patients need particular attention to prolonged viral RNA shedding, which might be associated with poor treatment outcomes. Understanding the virological dynamics during the process of illness should be helpful in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.

    >>> Background
      An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a public health emergency. Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from 2 hospitals outside Wuhan.

    >>> Results
      The median (interquartile range) duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 (13–22) days as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (≥15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (P = .001), severe illness at admission (P = .049), invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006), and corticosteroid treatment (P = .025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (P < .001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (P < .001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.31–8.02), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10–1.54), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11–88.02) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

    >>> Conclusions
      Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Hospital admission and general treatments should be started as soon as possible in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially male patients.

The proportion of patients with severe disease at admission in the group with prolonged shedding was significantly higher than that in the group with early viral RNA clearance (34.2% vs 16.2%, P = .049).

The proportion of patients with severe disease at admission in the male group (37.9%) was significantly higher than that in the female group (14.9%, P = .010). The median length of hospital stay was longer in the male group than in the female group (median days, 15 vs 22; P = .002).

    let !j self assert = In our study, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-α were the most frequently used antiviral regimens. It was hard to evaluate the efficacy of these 2-drug combination because of the lack of controls.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !k self assert = Corticosteroid usage was related to prolonged viral RNA shedding time in this report as well, as patients with early RNA clearance had lower proportion of patients using corticosteroid compared with patients with late RNA clearance (40.5% vs 64.5%, P = .025). However, this difference can be influenced by disease severity, as patients who were given corticosteroids usually had more severe disease than those who did not. Furthermore, corticosteroid use was not found to be an independent risk factor for prolonged viral RNA shedding in the multivariable model conducted in this report. Thus, a definitive conclusion that corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding duration in patients with COVID-19 cannot be drawn. The reason for the inconsistent results might be that the corticosteroid doses in this report were relatively low (0.5–1 mg methylprednisolone/kg body weight) for patients with COVID-19.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !l self assert = Invasive mechanical ventilator support was found to be another important independent predictor of prolonged viral RNA shedding. Another potential reason for prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding is the emergence of drug resistance during antiviral treatment, since most of the patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation had a longer hospital stay.

In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously. Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing. Median age was 53 years (range: 21–68); 8 patients were male. Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2–3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.

    let !a self assert = Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). The most commonly reported initial signs or symptoms were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Two patients reported neither fever nor cough initially, though they developed them subsequently: one reported sore throat as their initial symptom and the other reported diarrhea (one day before fever and cough); the patient with diarrhea had recently traveled outside the United States before illness onset and later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes difficile.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !b self assert = Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. All hospitalized patients had oxygen saturation <94% on room air at some point during their illness, with oxygen saturation nadir (range: 86–93%) occurring at a median of illness day 12 (range: 4–23) (Fig. 2). Five patients reported difficulty in breathing and four received supplemental oxygen. Patient 9 required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation and intensive care monitoring. No patients required mechanical ventilation.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !c self assert = Median duration of fever was 9 d (range: 2–11). Peak body temperature during hospitalization (range: 99.1–102.9 °F) occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4–10).

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !d self assert = Two patients received a short course (≤3 d) of corticosteroids. Three, including one who received corticosteroids, received the investigational antiviral remdesivir (Gilead Sciences) under expanded access (compassionate use) for a duration of 4–10 d. Following remdesivir initiation, all had transient gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis or rectal bleeding. No other post-remdesivir symptoms were observed.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !e self assert = Patient 9 reported loose stool and rectal bleeding; as noted above, this patient had recently traveled outside the United States before illness onset and their stool later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes difficile. Remdesivir was discontinued after improvement in each patient’s respiratory symptoms.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !f self assert = Blood cultures were negative in all six hospitalized patients tested, including those obtained from four patients treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia. Molecular testing for influenza A and B on respiratory specimens was negative and multipathogen respiratory PCR panels were negative for all targets in all hospitalized patients

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !g self assert = Six of seven hospitalized patients had leukopenia (<4,000 cells per µl) and the white blood cell count nadir occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4–15). Procalcitonin levels were <0.25 ng ml−1 in all six patients tested. Aminotransferase levels were elevated in all hospitalized patients: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels peaked (median peak value 129 U l−1, range 46–190 U l−1) at a median of illness day 13 (range 7–19) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels peaked (median peak value 136 U l−1, range 66–389 U l−1) at a median of illness day 14 (range: 6–23).

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !h self assert = Three of seven hospitalized patients had mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels >115 U l−1 (maximum value 163 U l−1). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels >600 U l−1, coinciding with clinical deterioration, were observed in two patients tested. No major elevations in serum total bilirubin (seven patients tested) or prolongations in prothrombin time (four patients tested) were identified.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !i self assert = Among the three remdesivir recipients, aminotransferase elevation developed in patient 6, 1 d after starting remdesivir and in patient 8, 4 d after starting remdesivir. Patient 9 had an aminotransferase peak before starting remdesivir and a second peak 5 d after starting remdesivir.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !j self assert = Unilateral or bilateral opacities were seen on chest imaging for all hospitalized patients. Four hospitalized patients had normal initial chest radiographs (illness day range: 4–9). One had an abnormal chest computed tomography scan on the day of the normal chest radiograph.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !k self assert = All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2–3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !l self assert = SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR with reverse transcription (rRT–PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values of virus isolated from the first tissue culture passage were 12.3–35.7 and for one patient, virus isolated from tissue culture passage 3 had a titer of 7.75 × 106 median tissue culture infectious dose per ml; these data were likely more reflective of growth in tissue culture than patient viral load.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !m self assert = All 12 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in at least one nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, 11 of 12 in an oropharyngeal (OP) swab, 6 of 6 in sputum, 1 of 11 in serum, 7 of 10 in stool and 0 of 10 in urine. Among 117 pairs of simultaneous NP and OP specimens, 45 (38%) had discordant results. Among 32 discordant pairs with one positive specimen, the NP specimen was positive in 21 (66%). Thirteen additional discordant pairs had one negative and one inconclusive specimen

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !n self assert = Mean Ct values in positive specimens were 17.0–39.0 for NP, 22.3–39.7 for OP and 24.1–39.4 for stool. Ct values of upper respiratory tract specimens were lower in the first week of illness than the second in most patients (Extended Data Fig. 8); in some patients, low Ct values continued into the second and third week of illness. SARS-CoV-2 rRT–PCR results turned positive in serum of patient 9 in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical deterioration.Ct values and duration of RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract did not seem to differ by hospitalization status or oxygen requirement

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !o self assert = All patients reported symptom resolution. Eleven patients reported cough (often intermittent) as the last symptom. Median symptom duration was 14 d (range: 6–37). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7 of 12 patients, including in NP (n = 6), OP (n = 3), sputum (n = 1) and stool (n = 3) specimens. Home isolation or Transmission-Based Precautions were discontinued for all patients per CDC criteria4; the last respiratory specimens tested at CDC with a positive test result were collected from these patients on days 8–36 (median = day 19).

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !p self assert = Complete genome sequences were generated from respiratory specimens from all 12 patients. The sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes; phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups that were not divergent from each other, suggesting that these patients were identified during an early stage of the outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis from these 12 patients’ respiratory tract specimens support a recent zoonotic transmission event and subsequent human-to-human transmission.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !q self assert = The highest viral RNA levels in the upper respiratory tract were typically detected in the first week of illness, and viable SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. Viral RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution for seven patients, although the implications for infectiousness and transmission later in illness are unclear.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !r self assert =  Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or laboratory signs of worsening including hypoxemia or elevation of aminotransferases. Although some patients received empiric antibiotics for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia, we found definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection. Worsening in the second week of illness is consistent with previous reports, and highlights the importance of close monitoring beyond the first week, even in patients with mild illness or no initial radiographic abnormalities.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !s self assert = Patient 9, the most severely ill among this series, experienced clinical deterioration late in the second week of illness. This was the only patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in serum and detection in serum was temporally related to clinical deterioration. Similar observations have been described previously

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !t self assert = We detected viral RNA and cultured virus from upper respiratory specimens, even from patients with predominantly lower respiratory tract illness. Ct values in upper respiratory tract specimens typically were lowest during the first week of illness (suggesting high RNA levels), consistent with previous reports. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper respiratory tract specimens for 2–3 weeks in most patients and for as long as 36 days. Sputum specimens were less frequently available; in two patients with a productive cough and available sputum, viral RNA was detected in sputum longer than in NP or OP specimens. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool of multiple patients and in the serum of one hospitalized patient.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !u self assert = SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and duration of RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract did not seem to vary by illness severity and viral RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in several patients

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa398
  ref 'Yuan_et_al_2020
    head = According to our study, it is probably that two negative RT-PCR tests 24 hours apart may not be sufficient for viral clearance evaluation. Repeated viral RT-PCR testing separated by prolonged duration like 48 hours is essential to assure that virus has actually cleared and the discharged patients no longer transmitted the virus. On the other hand, we suggest that some immunological parameters such as D-dimer and absolute lymphocyte count, and even antibody test should be combined with RT-PCR negative test as additional measures to assure that infected patients have completely recovered and can be released from quarantine.

    >>> Abstract
      We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge. We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration (r= -0.637; p=0.002) and time to virus recrudescence (r= 0.52; p=0.008) respectively, suggesting the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in COVID-19 patients.

    let !a self assert = The study population included 172 discharged COVID-19 patients from Jan 23th 2020 to Feb 21th 2020. These were 25 of discharged patients (total 14.5%) sent to hospital again because of the positive RT-PCR results on virus again. With the median age of 28 years (IQR: 16.25-42), 17 of them were females, including 6 children under 12 years old

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert =  According to their previous medical records, these patients had experienced an average of 15.36±3.81 days of hospital stay, as well as 13.33±3.93 days of potential antivirus therapy with ritonavir/lopinavir and IFN-α, no obvious differences with other discharged patients. Before discharging from the hospital, these patients all showed improvements on chest computed tomography (CT) evidence and exhibited with two consecutive negative results (24 hours of interval) on virus mRNA by RT-PCR assays.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = After leaving the hospital to self-quarantine at home, the discharged patients hadn’t taken drug any longer but just monitored at home by RT-PCR detection of COVID-19 with both cloacal swab and nasopharyngeal swab samples in each three days. Unexpectedly, cloacal swab samples of 14 patients turned positive on virus mRNA and another 11 patients showed positive results of nasopharyngeal swab sample testing.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !d self assert = Overall, the mean duration from their final negative PCR result to hospital discharge was 2.71±1.88 days. While the average period from positive again to previous discharge lasted for 5.23±4.13 days. Thereby, these 25 patients experienced an average of 7.32±3.86 days from their last negative RT-PCR result to turning positive again.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !e self assert = Notably, these patients once represented with the common symptoms of fever (68%) and cough (60%) and 24 of them were non-severe types at the first onset. At this time of hospital readmission, only 8 patients (32%) had mild cough.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !f self assert = Besides, CT scan results indicated that 12 of them were characterized by improvement of original lesions compared with images before leaving the hospital, while another 8 patients showed no worsening than previous results.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !g self assert = When they readmitted to hospital, the formula of Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction was used for these 25 patients. Within an average of 2.73 days of hospital stay, the RT-PCR results of virus mRNA detection were all turning to negative in both nasopharyngeal swab and cloacal swab samples. These patient were all stayed for a prolonged observation.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !h self assert = On the other hand, previous clinical and laboratory outcomes were compared between these 25 patients (with conversion of RT-PCR results from negative to positive after being discharged from the hospital) and rest 147 patients (continuously represented negative for the virus after discharge). They showed no distinguished differences on the levels of laboratory parameters before leaving the hospital.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !i self assert = Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between serum D-Dimer level before discharging and the duration of treatment in these 25 patients (r=-0.637, p=0.002), instead of the rest 147 patients.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !j self assert = Furthermore, lymphocyte concentrations before these 25 patient leaving the hospital were significantly positively correlated (r=0.52, p=0.008) with the time interval for virus reappearing.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !k self assert =  Besides, the RT-PCR results then turning to negative within an average of 2.73 days of hospital stay. Even the Chinese herbal medicine was used for these readmitted patients, it is hard to assess the effect on virus clearance. Further case-control study and cohort study will be needed to pursue that.

    head = This study is the first case series from 56 COVID-19 patients with 299 samples of RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our preliminary results are notable for providing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 dynamic profile in patients infected. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients. We conclude that longer periods of follow up and repeat testing are necessary to limit viral spread.

      A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic threatens the world. Here, we first studied the dynamics profile of SARS-CoV-2 from 56 recovered COVID-19 patients. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients.

    let !a self assert =  We studied RT-qPCR results from 56 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Each patient received four to seven tests over several weeks after symptom onset. In first 3 weeks after symptoms onset, majority results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. From week 3 after symptoms onset, number of negative RT-PCR results increased. All results of RT-PCR tests were negative in week 6 after onset. The positive rate of RT-PCR test results was highest at week 1 (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and 0% at week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5 and week 6 respectively.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert = The longest duration between RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was 42 days after onset of symptoms. The median duration between onset of symptom to nucleic acid conversion was 24 days (IQR, 18-31)

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert =  We divided patients into non-prolonged and prolonged shedding group according to nucleic acid conversion time (≤24 days or >24 days). Patients with prolonged viral shedding tend to be older (p=0.011) and were more likely to have comorbidities as diabetes (p=0.016) and hypertension (p=0.006).

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa619
  ref 'Tom_et_al_2020
    head =  Currently, diagnosis, screening, and surveillance depend on a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) test and results are generally reported to the ordering physician as positive or negative. However, the test does provide a measure of the viral load in the sample, in what is called the cycle threshold (Ct) value. We suggest that reporting this Ct value, or a calculate viral load, can aid in interpretation and clinical decisions. We discuss the merits of PCR tests and other approaches such as time since symptom resolution based approaches for removing individuals from isolation.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !a self assert = Xiao et al. report that SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR results can remain positive up to five weeks after onset of symptoms. The authors studied RT-qPCR results from 56 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Each patient received four to seven tests over several weeks after symptom onset. The percentage of positive results declined from 100% in week one to 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4%, and 0% in weeks two, three, four, five, and six, respectively. The median time from symptom onset to negative testing was 24 days. Prolonged positive test results were associated with older age and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Additionally, there were four patients with two consecutive negative test results who later tested positive again. A limitation is that the test reports did not report out Ct values, which would have provided valuable information about the amount of viral RNA in the samples, important particularly later in the course of infection.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert = Prevention (CDC) suggest one of two approaches for discontinuing isolation, one based on time since symptom onset and resolution, and the other centred on two negative tests at least 24 hours apart. The first approach assumes a person is generally no longer transmitting virus 10 days after symptom resolution. This approach is test-sparing and is particularly useful when resources are scarce or in the outpatient setting where repeat testing is onerous. When testing is available, decisions to lift isolation rely heavily on negative PCR tests to define a patient as no longer infectious. However, if a positive PCR test is intended to mean infectivity, then this approach may not be optimal. Closer examination of what the test results mean clinically, particularly when results are from RNA quantities near the lower limit of detection of the assay, could help guide clinical and public health strategies.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test provides real-time quantification by first reverse transcribing SARS-CoV-2 RNA into DNA (RT step), and then performing qPCR where a fluorescence signal increases proportionally to the amount of amplified nucleic acid, enabling accurate quantitation of the RNA in the sample. If the fluorescence reaches a specified threshold within a certain number of PCR cycles (Ct value), the sample is considered a positive result. The Ct value is inversely related to the viral load and every ~3.3 increase in the Ct value reflects a 10-fold reduction in starting material. Many qPCR assays involve a Ct cutoff of 40 to consider the test positive, allowing detection of very few starting RNA molecules.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !d self assert = This high sensitivity for viral RNA can be helpful for initial diagnosis. However, reporting as a binary positive or negative result removes useful information that could inform clinical decision making.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !e self assert =  Following complete resolution of symptoms, people can have prolonged positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR test results, potentially for weeks, as Xiao et al report. At these late time points,the Ct value is often very high, representing presence of very low copies of viral RNA. In these cases, where viral RNA copies in the sample may be fewer than 100, results are reported to the clinician simply as positive. This leaves the clinician with little choice but to interpret the results no differently than for a sample from someone who is floridly positive and where RNA copies routinely reach 100 million or more.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !f self assert = A positive RT-qPCR result may not necessarily mean the person is still infectious or that they still have any meaningful disease. First, the RNA could be from nonviable or killed virus. Live virus is often isolable only during the first week of symptoms but not after day 8, even with positive RT-qPCR tests. Second, there may need to be a minimum amount of viable virus for onward transmission.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !g self assert =  For infection control purposes, the utility of the assay is greatest when identifying people who are floridly positive and at risk of further transmission. Particularly when testing in the absence of symptoms for COVID-19, we believe that reporting the Ct value or range could help to better inform clinical decisions.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !h self assert = We propose that for inpatients whose symptoms have fully resolved and two tests over 24 hours apart are either negative or close to the Ct cutoff (i.e. Ct >34), they likely do not have meaningful or transmissible disease, and thus do not need to be retested. This would conserve valuable testing capacity, reagents, and PPE.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !i self assert =  Furthermore, the clinician could take the Ct results in context and determine when the patient can discontinue isolation. This could shorten duration of isolation and for healthcare workers and other essential workers would provide a more evidence-based, testing-informed pathway for more rapid return to work. Taking the Ct value into account may also help justify symptom-based strategies recommended by the CDC including time-since-illness-onset and time-since-symptom-resolution based approaches (i.e.lifting of isolation after ten days following resolution of symptoms.)

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !j self assert = Lastly, there may be implications for public health screening, enabling contact tracers to focus on persons most likely to be infectious. This will become increasingly important as asymptomatic screening expands.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !k self assert = The Ct value could be high as a result of early disease and the Ct value would have to be considered in clinical context. A person with a high Ct value tested early in the disease course might be or become infectious and this would present as a significant decrease in Ct value 24 hours following the first test.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !l self assert = A patient with resolved symptoms and two Ct values both close to the cutoff is likely recovering and no longer infectious. Evidence from both viral isolation and contact tracing studies support a short, early period of transmissibility.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !m self assert = By accounting for the Ct value in context, RT-qPCR results can be used in a way that is personalized, highly sensitive, and also more specific.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !n self assert = To implement this, the actual Ct values could be reported along with reference ranges or converted to viral load and or categorized as high, medium, or low.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !o self assert = Repeat testing over 24 hours is not always feasible and is always resource heavy when testing islimited. Time since symptom onset or time since symptom resolution based approaches may be as or more useful in many situations. As more detailed data emerge and provide increased certainty about the length of infectivity, there may be discussion about shifting entirely to these time-based criteria.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !p self assert = As long as resource limitations in testing and PPE exist, we believe that time-since symptom resolution and test-based strategies should continue to coexist and complement one another. Healthcare workers, who may have easier access to testing and who may be most crucial to get back to work quicker might benefit by test-based clearance, particularly if the Ct value is considered.

    / May, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !q self assert = It should be recognized that certain populations may tend to remain infectious for longer showed that older patients were more likely to have prolonged positive results and presumably longer infectivity. Severe disease is also a risk factor for longer viral shedding. Larger studies that account for potential confounding are necessary to determine viral shedding dynamics in different populations, including those who are immunocompromised or treated with immunomodulatory agents. For now, test-based clearance may be preferred for these patients. Having both time- and test-based guidelines enables clinicians to select based on the patient and setting.

    let !a self assert = Soon after its introduction in Europe in the 1920s, epidemiological studies reported that BCG vaccination strongly reduced infant mortality, and this could not be explained by a reduction in tuberculosis alone. Later on, similar studies in other locations, including randomized controlled trials, showed an up to 50% reduction of mortality induced by BCG in young infants. This reduction in childhood mortality by BCG appeared to be due to the protection against unrelated infectious agents and especially respiratory tract infections and neonatal sepsis. Although the authors did not discriminate between bacterial and viral infections in these studies, it is well known that viral pathogens are the main cause of respiratory tract infections in children.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !b self assert = This hypothesis was strengthened by a study in Guinea-Bissau showing that BCG reduced the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus infection. A similar protective effect of BCG on respiratory tract infections was found in older individuals in Indonesia, and a clinical trial performed in Japan demonstrated protection against pneumonia in tuberculin-negative older individuals. Last, a recent study in adolescents in South Africa also reported a 70% reduction of respiratory tract infections by BCG vaccination

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !c self assert = Spencer et al. showed that BCG reduced viral titres of influenza A virus in mice, an effect dependent on macrophages. BCG vaccination also protected from herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) in a controlled infection model with newborn mice, while subcutaneous administration of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of the mycobacterial cell wall, protected against vaccinia virus and HSV2 infections in mice. This effect was mediated by peritoneal macrophages, suggesting strong effects of BCG on the innate immune component of host defence. In line with this, a recent murine study showed that intravenous BCG delivery led to increased cytokine production by both splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages upon ex vivo restimulation with various unrelated pathogens.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !d self assert = BCG vaccination of healthy human volunteers results in enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6, when monocytes from these individuals are stimulated ex vivo with unrelated pathogens. Interestingly, these effects are accompanied by transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of the myeloid cells in the BCG-vaccinated individuals. The epigenetic changes are manifested as chemical modifications (methylation and acetylation) of the histone, resulting in enhanced chromatin accessibility, easier transcription of genes important for antimicrobial responses and improved cell function. In addition, metabolic reprogramming leads to selective accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites that regulate this process, owing to their function as cofactors for several classes of enzymes that mediate the epigenetic changes.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !e self assert = It has been hypothesized that induction of trained immunity is at least partly the mechanism through which BCG vaccination induces its beneficial effects. The idea here is that BCG leads to epigenetically trained populations of monocytes and/or natural killer cells, which most likely reside in the bone marrow. Upon challenge with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; which could be from bacteria or viruses) these innate immune cells then show an enhanced response, promoting host defence. This might explain why a vaccine for tuberculosis leads to protection against multiple pathogens.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !f self assert = In a recent study in healthy human volunteers, it has been shown that BCG vaccination reduces viraemia in response to the yellow fever vaccine (which is a live attenuated vaccine). This response is associated with epigenetic changes in monocytes that correlate with improved antiviral responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that the induction of trained immunity by BCG vaccination results in significant protection against multiple viral infection

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !g self assert = On the basis of these data, it has been hypothesized that BCG vaccination might be a potent preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or may reduce COVID-19 disease severity. Ecological studies have suggested that countries and regions that mandate BCG vaccination for the population have a lower number of infections and a reduced mortality from COVID-19. While these data could indeed suggest a protective effect of BCG vaccination, such studies cannot provide definitive proof of causality, owing to several inherent biases.These include differences in, one, demographic and genetic structure of the populations in different locations; two, differences in the non-pharmaceutical interventions being adopted in different locations (such as quarantine or social distancing); three, differences in diagnosing and reporting COVID-19 cases; and, four, differences in the positions on the epidemic curve of each location.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !h self assert = Notwithstanding these issues, the link to BCG and COVID-19 from these studies is intriguing. It is not known whether older people would maintain a pool of trained monocytes many years after BCG vaccination. A possible explanation is that children who have been vaccinated with BCG are less susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and so there is less spread of the virus to older populations, although this would need to be demonstrated.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !i self assert = Because of these important limitations, randomized controlled trials are needed to provide the highest quality proof for the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may protect against COVID-19. It is reasonable to propose that these are first initiated in populations at high risk of infection or with a high risk of mortality, such as hospital staff working in close contact with patients with COVID-19 or older individuals.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !j self assert = Trials assessing the efficacy of BCG vaccination in these categories of individuals are currently being performed in the Netherlands, Australia and Greece, while other trials are being planned in the United States, UK, Denmark, France, Uruguay, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !k self assert = One important aspect relates to the boosting of the innate immune response by BCG. Might this be deleterious, considering the fact that an exaggerated cytokine response has been associated with complications in patients with COVID-19? We would argue that in healthy individuals vaccinated with BCG, in which innate antimicrobial mechanisms would be boosted by trained immunity, this is most likely to lead to inhibited viral replication, decreased viral loads and subsequently less inflammation and symptoms. This hypothesis is supported by the decrease in viraemia seen following yellow fever vaccination of individuals who were previously vaccinated with BCG.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !l self assert = By contrast, an initial defective antiviral response in some individuals at high risk (for example, older individuals) can result in high viral loads, stimulation of an inefficient systemic inflammation and severe disease. Breaking the loop of systemic inflammation could have beneficial effects in these patients.

    / May, 2020 - Nature Reviews Immunology
    let !m self assert = The use of approaches to induce trained immunity for protection against COVID-19 may not be restricted to BCG: indeed, there is speculation that oral polio vaccine might protect against non-related viral infections, and the new recombinant BCG-based vaccine VPM1002 may have similar effects and is also being considered for clinical trials.

    head = For the patient described in the vignette, the most important aspect of care is careful monitoring of his respiratory status to determine whether endotracheal intubation is appropriate. If mechanical ventilation is initiated, the clinician should adhere to a lung-protective ventilation strategy by limiting the plateau pressure and tidal volumes. Deep sedation with neuromuscular blocking agents and prone positioning should be considered if refractory hypoxemia develops. Anticoagulants should be administered to prevent thrombosis. Preliminary data support the use of remdesivir if available. Rigorous adherence to infection-control practices is essential at all times. Given the high risk of complications from severe Covid-19, clinicians should work with patients and families to establish appropriate goals of care at the earliest possible time.

    let !a self assert = A 50-year-old, previously healthy man presents to the emergency department with 2 days of worsening dyspnea. He had fever, cough, and fatigue during the week before presentation. He appears acutely ill. The body temperature is 39.5°C (103°F), heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 130/60 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation is 87% while the patient is breathing ambient air. The white-cell count is 7300 per microliter with lymphopenia. Chest radiography shows patchy bilateral opacities in the lung parenchyma. A reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay detects the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in a nasopharyngeal swab.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !b self assert = The most common initial symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgias, and diarrhea. Severe illness usually begins approximately 1 week after the onset of symptoms. Dyspnea is the most common symptom of severe disease and is often accompanied by hypoxemia. A striking feature of Covid-19 is the rapid progression of respiratory failure soon after the onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !c self assert = Patients with severe Covid-19 commonly meet the criteria for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is defined as the acute onset of bilateral infiltrates, severe hypoxemia, and lung edema that is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. The majority of patients with severe Covid-19 have lymphopenia, and some have disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system. Severe Covid-19 may also lead to acute cardiac, kidney, and liver injury, in addition to cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and shock. These organ failures may be associated with a cytokine release syndrome characterized by high fevers, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and elevation of other inflammatory markers.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !d self assert = For epidemiologic purposes, severe Covid-19 in adults is defined as dyspnea, a respiratory rate of 30 or more breaths per minute, a blood oxygen saturation of 93% or less, a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2:Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg, or infiltrates in more than 50% of the lung field within 24 to 48 hours from the onset of symptoms.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !e self assert = In a large cohort of patients with Covid-19, 81% had mild disease, 14% had severe disease, and 5% became critically ill with organ failure; the mortality in the critically ill group was 49%. The majority of critically ill patients with Covid-19 receive prolonged mechanical ventilation.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !f self assert = People with chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are more likely to become critically ill from Covid-19. The incidence of critical illness is also higher among men than among women and higher among persons older than 65 years of age than among younger persons. However, healthy persons of any age can become critically ill with Covid-19. A hallmark of the Covid-19 pandemic is the sudden appearance of an unprecedented number of critically ill patients in a small geographic area.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !g self assert = BASICS OF RESPIRATORY CARE: Patients should be monitored carefully by direct observation and pulse oximetry. Oxygen should be supplemented by the use of a nasal cannula or Venturi mask to keep the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin between 90 and 96%. Deciding whether or not to intubate is a critical aspect of caring for seriously ill patients with Covid-19. Clinicians must weigh the risks of premature intubation against the risk of sudden respiratory arrest with a chaotic emergency intubation, which exposes staff to a greater risk of infection. Signs of excessive effort in breathing, hypoxemia that is refractory to oxygen supplementation, and encephalopathy herald impending respiratory arrest and the need for urgent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is no single number or algorithm that determines the need for intubation, and clinicians must consider a variety of factors.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !h self assert = If the patient does not undergo intubation but remains hypoxemic, a high-flow nasal cannula can improve oxygenation and may prevent intubation in selected patients.18,19 The use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation should probably be restricted to patients with Covid-19 who have respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or obstructive sleep apnea rather than ARDS. However, some experts discourage the use of high-flow nasal cannulae and noninvasive ventilation because these treatments may inappropriately delay recognition of the need for endotracheal intubation and expose clinicians to infectious aerosols.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !i self assert = Having awake patients turn to the prone position while they breathe high concentrations of supplemental oxygen may improve gas exchange in patients with severe Covid-19. This approach is supported by a case series describing its use in nonintubated patients with ARDS unrelated to Covid-19. However, whether prone positioning can prevent intubation in patients with severe Covid-19 is unclear. Because it is difficult to provide rescue ventilation to patients who are prone, this position should be avoided in patients whose condition is rapidly deteriorating.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !j self assert = ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION: If possible, intubation should be performed after preoxygenation and rapid-sequence induction of sedation and neuromuscular blockade. An antiviral filter should be placed in line with the airway circuit at all times. Video laryngoscopy may allow the operator to have a good view of the airway from a greater distance. However, operators should choose the technique that is most likely to be successful on the first attempt. Continuous-wave capnography is the best method to confirm tracheal intubation. Patients with Covid-19 often become hypotensive soon after intubation owing to positive-pressure ventilation and systemic vasodilation from sedatives. Therefore, intravenous fluids and vasopressors should be immediately available at the time of intubation, and careful hemodynamic monitoring is essential.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !k self assert = VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT: To prevent alveolar overdistention, clinicians should limit both the tidal volume delivered by the ventilator and the maximum pressure in the alveoli at the end of inspiration. To do this, clinicians should set the ventilator to deliver a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight; this approach is termed “lung-protective ventilation.” A tidal volume up to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight is allowed if the patient becomes distressed and attempts to take larger tidal volumes.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !l self assert = A few times each day, clinicians should initiate a half-second end-inspiratory pause, which allows the pressure in the airway circuit to equilibrate between the patient and the ventilator. The pressure in the airway circuit at the end of the pause — “the plateau pressure” — approximates the alveolar pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure). To prevent alveolar overdistention, the plateau pressure should not exceed 30 cm of water. A higher plateau pressure without the development of ventilator-induced lung injury may be possible in patients with central obesity or noncompliant chest walls.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !m self assert = For patients with Covid-19–related ARDS, setting sufficient positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator may prevent alveolar collapse and facilitate the recruitment of unstable lung regions. As a result, PEEP can improve respiratory-system compliance and allow for a reduction in the Fio2. However, PEEP can reduce venous return to the heart and cause hemodynamic instability. Moreover, excessive PEEP can lead to alveolar overdistention and reduce respiratory-system compliance. No particular method of determining the appropriate level of PEEP has been shown to be superior to other methods.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !n self assert = Sedatives and analgesics should be targeted to prevent pain, distress, and dyspnea. They can also be used to blunt the patient’s respiratory drive, which improves patient synchrony with mechanical ventilation. Sedation is especially important in febrile patients with high metabolic rates who are treated with lung-protective ventilation. Neuromuscular blocking agents can be used in deeply sedated patients who continue to use their accessory muscles of ventilation and have refractory hypoxemia. These agents can reduce the work of breathing, which reduces oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Moreover, sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents may help reduce the risk of lung injury that may occur when patients generate strong spontaneous respiratory efforts.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !o self assert = REFRACTORY HYPOXEMIA: Clinicians should consider prone positioning during mechanical ventilation in patients with refractory hypoxemia (Pao2:Fio2 of <150 mm Hg during respiration and Fio2 of 0.6 despite appropriate PEEP). In randomized trials involving intubated patients with ARDS (not associated with Covid-19), placing the patient in the prone position for 16 hours per day has improved oxygenation and reduced mortality.18,29 However, prone positioning of patients requires a team of at least three trained clinicians, all of whom require full PPE.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !p self assert = Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., inhaled nitric oxide) can also improve oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure, although they do not improve survival in ARDS not associated with Covid-19. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential rescue strategy in patients with refractory respiratory failure. However, ECMO may not be effective owing to the cytokine storm and hypercoagulability of Covid-19, and its use will probably be limited as the pandemic strains resources.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !q self assert = SUPPORTIVE CARE: Patients with Covid-19 often present with volume depletion and receive isotonic-fluid resuscitation. Volume repletion helps maintain blood pressure and cardiac output during intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. After the first few days of mechanical ventilation, the goal should be to avoid hypervolemia. Fever and tachypnea in patients with severe Covid-19 often increase insensible water loss, and careful attention must be paid to water balance.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !r self assert = If the patient is hypotensive, the dose of vasopressor can be adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 to 65 mm Hg.18 Norepinephrine is the preferred vasopressor. The presence of unexplained hemodynamic instability should prompt consideration of myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !s self assert = In case series, approximately 5% of patients with severe Covid-19 have received renal-replacement therapy; the pathophysiology of the renal failure is currently unclear but is probably multifactorial. Because blood clotting in the circuit is common in patients with severe Covid-19, the efficacy of continuous renal-replacement therapy is uncertain.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !t self assert = Abnormalities of the clotting cascade, such as thrombocytopenia and elevation of d-dimer levels, are common in patients with severe Covid-19 and are associated with increased mortality. Prophylactic low-dose heparin should be used to reduce the risk of venous thrombosis. However, in one series of critically ill patients with Covid-19, one third had clinically significant venous or arterial thrombosis despite thromboprophylaxis. Life-threatening thrombosis has also occurred despite full-dose anticoagulation with heparins. The benefits and risks of more intense anticoagulation or of using direct thrombin inhibitors in patients with severe Covid-19 are unknown.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !u self assert = Patients hospitalized with severe Covid-19 are often treated empirically with antibiotics. However, bacterial coinfection is rare when patients first present to the hospital. Antibiotics can be discontinued after a short course if signs of bacterial coinfection, such as leukocytosis and focal pulmonary infiltrates, are absent. Although Covid-19 itself can cause prolonged fever, clinicians should be vigilant for nosocomial infections.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !v self assert = Patients with Covid-19 who are receiving mechanical ventilation should receive appropriate nutrition and care to prevent constipation and injury to the skin and corneas. If the condition of a patient has stabilized, clinicians should attempt to withhold continuous sedation each day. Daily awakening may be challenging because an increase in the work of breathing and the loss of synchrony with mechanical ventilation may result in distress and hypoxemia.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !w self assert = Preliminary data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving more than 1000 patients with severe Covid-19 suggest that the investigational antiviral agent remdesivir reduces time to recovery,43 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted it emergency-use authorization. No agent is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of severe Covid-19. Numerous randomized trials of many other candidate therapies are ongoing.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !x self assert = The delayed onset of critical illness in patients with Covid-19 suggests a maladaptive host response to infection. Therefore, there is intense interest in the effects of immunomodulating therapies. Glucocorticoids have been used widely for cytokine storm and respiratory failure in patients with Covid-19; however, there is concern that they may prolong viral shedding and lead to secondary infections. Current guidelines offer conflicting advice on the use of glucocorticoids. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests a short course of glucocorticoids for moderate-to-severe ARDS related to Covid-19, whereas the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends their use only in the context of a clinical trial.For reversal of vasopressor-dependent shock in patients with Covid-19, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends low-dose glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg daily by means of infusion or with intermittent dosing).

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !y self assert = Other immunomodulating agents currently being evaluated for severe Covid-19 include passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma, intravenous immunoglobulin, and interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 pathway inhibition.Pending results of randomized trials, the risks and benefits of these approaches are also unknown. Candidate therapies for Covid-19 warrant evaluation separately in patients with established severe disease and in those with milder illness to determine whether they reduce the risk of progression.

  ref 'Miller_et_al_2020b
    head = Overall, our findings highlight the use of genomic data to effectively track the spread of an emerging virus using phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches that have been developed to study viral outbreaks. We have hereby succeeded in tracking the main transmission chains that led to SARS-CoV-2 spread in Israel, and applied phylodynamic analysis to infer key epidemiological parameters governing its spread. Our results suggest that superspreading events are a main feature of SARS-CoV-2 spread, suggesting that focused measures to reduce contacts of select individuals/social events could dramatically mitigate viral spread. Finally our results highlight how global connectivity allows for massive introductions of a virus, and emphasize how border control and shelter-in-place restrictionsare crucial for halting viral spread.

    >>> Abstract
      Full genome sequences are increasingly used to track the geographic spread and transmission dynamics of viral pathogens. Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. A phylogenetic analysis including thousands of globally sampled sequences allowed us to infer multiple independent introductions into Israel, followed by local transmission. Returning travelers from the U.S. contributed dramatically more to viral spread relative to their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around ~2.0-2.6, dropping by two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. A comparison between reported and model-estimated case numbers indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 1-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings underscore the ability of this virus to efficiently transmit between and within countries, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing its spread.

    let !a self assert = With a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. We found multiple introductions into Israel from both the U.S and Europe, the latter including mainly the U.K., France and Belgium. Over 70% of the clade introductions into Israel (confidence intervals ranging from ~50% to ~80%, see Methods) were inferred to have occurred from the U.S., while the remaining were mainly from Europe. During the entire epidemic in Israel, very close monitoring of all incoming infected travelers was imposed, and reports show that only ~27% of infected returning travelers were from the U.S. Moreover, this suggests that had flights from the U.S. been arrested at the same time that flights from Europe were arrested (between February 26 and March 4, instead of by March 9), a substantial fraction of the transmission chains in Israel would have been prevented.

    / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !b self assert = Super-spreading is a feature of viral spread: Specifically, if we assume almost complete case reporting, our phylodynamic analysis indicates that between 5-9% of infections are responsible for 80% of secondary infections; with lower assumed levels of case reporting, between 1-5% of infections would be responsible for this 80% of secondary infections.

    / May, 2020 - Medrxiv

    let !e self assert = A total of 224 unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified between the Wuhanreference sequence and this set of sequences from Israel. Of these SNVs (single nucleotide variants), 141 were non-synonymous, 72 were synonymous, and the remaining 11 were in noncoding regions. One of the most abundantly detected SNVs was a non-synonymous variant D614G found in the spike protein, which was present in 90% of the sequences. This variant has generated much interest as it has been reported to potentially increase the transmissibility of the virus.

    / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !f self assert = We also found five different high confidence genomic deletions, spanning between one and eighteen nucleotides, each of which was found in one to two samples. Three of these five deletions occurred in multiples of three and were in-frame deletions or affected non-coding regions. Of the remaining two deletions, deletion 3 spanned ten nucleotides, and likely prevents the translation of ORF7a. Deletion 4 occurred at the end of ORF8 and causes the replacement of the last amino acid with an additional five amino acids. Notably, an 81 nt in-frame deletion in ORF7a has been previously reported (Holland, et al. 2020), as has been a 382 nt deletion in ORF8, suggesting that the virus is to some extent tolerant to deletions in these ORFs.

    / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !g self assert = When focusing on deletions that occurred in two samples, we noted that the two samples bearing deletion 1 were located in very remote clades on the phylogeny, suggesting that the deletion occurred two independent times. Deletion 5 on the other hand was present in two related samples that were sampled five days apart from each other. Deletions 2, 3 and 4 revealed an intriguing pattern: three independent deletions (one of which was present in two samples) were all part of the same clade that included eighteen samples. One non-synonymous SNV (single nucleotide variants) defined this clade: S2430R in ORF1b which affects the nonstructural protein NSP16. This protein has been reported to be a 2ʹO-methyl-transferase that enhances evasion of the innate immune system.

    / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !h self assert = At this point we conjecture that the deletions we detected are neutral or to some extent deleterious, and that deletions in SARS-CoV-2 are likely to occur frequently given the number of deletions detected in our samples.

    let !a self assert = Our results indicate 5-7 probable SSEs in Hong Kong, and substantial  individual heterogeneity in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1; k=0.45, 95%: 0.30 – 0.72) and therefore potential for future superspreading, albeit less than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (k=0.16 and 0.26 respectively).

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !b self assert = We estimated that approximately 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Hong Kong. These results however should be interpreted in the context of constrained community transmission given moderate levels of physical distancing currently practiced in Hong Kong, including school closures, some adults working at home, cancellation of mass gatherings, as well as improved hygiene and universal mask wearing.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !c self assert = Superspreading is considered a function of both variations in individual transmissibility and individual susceptibility or exposure. Our results show that the number of individual secondary cases was significantly higher within social settings such as bars and restaurants compared to family or work exposures (p<0.001). This is certainly due to the greater numbers of contacts expected in such settings. Targeted interventions should therefore focus on reducing extreme numbers of social contacts at high-risk venues such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants, which also appear at increased risk of SSE, either via closures or physical distancing policies, both of which currently remain implemented in Hong Kong.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !d self assert = Previous modelling has suggested that reduced delays between symptom onset and isolation are important indicators for the control of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks however this did not appear to play a major role in Hong Kong: in our analysis, delay from symptom onset to isolation were not associated with the number of individual secondary cases, nor the final cluster size. In contrast, for SARS-CoV various epidemics in 2003, due to delayed viral shedding among cases (highest approximately seven days after symptom onset), delays in case isolation adversely affected disease control efforts.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !e self assert = Public health authorities should focus on rapid tracing and quarantine of contacts, along with physical distancing to prevent superspreading events in high-risk social environments.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !f self assert = Given a coefficient of variation of 2.5 from our study this roughly corresponds to an adjusted herd immunity threshold of 20%, which is consistent with our estimate that 20% of individuals are responsible for 80% of transmission in Hong Kong. This compares to a herd-immunity threshold of 60-70% via vaccine-acquired immunity. The real-world effects of naturally acquired herd immunity however should be further studies and measured with serology along with the progressive easing of restrictions.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !g self assert = For COVID-19, confirmation and isolation of symptomatic cases will have a limited effect on reducing overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community unless done very quickly, noting the growing body of evidence of substantial transmission during the pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic period.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !h self assert = In Hong Kong, the average delay to isolation was 5.6 days for cluster cases, and by this time most onwards transmission had perhaps already occurred. The most important public health measures therefore are likely to be case identification followed by rapid and parallel (e.g. before contacts are confirmed as cases) contact tracing and quarantine. Some degree of intermittent physical distancing may also be required to supress potential local transmission from unidentified infections and pre-symptomatic transmission, but must necessarily be balanced with the social, economic and educational costs associated with such policies.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !i self assert = Secondly, our results also suggest a potential caveat: despite evidence supporting rapid contact tracing and the effectiveness of quarantine, in our analysis, most chains of transmission did not terminate in quarantine. This however must be interpreted in the context of moderate physical distancing in Hong Kong as highlighted previously, rather than a suggestion that quarantine was not essential.

    / May, 2020 - Epidemiology
    let !j self assert = In the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing implemented in Hong Kong, the potential for SSEs is likely greater than observed in our study. Assuming local elimination is not possible, disease control efforts should focus on rapid tracing and quarantine of confirmed contacts, along with the implementation of physical distancing policies or closures targeting high292 risk social exposures such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants to prevent the occurrence of SSEs. Given the long right-hand tail of the distribution of individual reproductive numbers, preventing SSEs would have a considerable effect in reducing the overall reproductive number. In lieu of an effective vaccine, theseresults have significant implications for the control of COVID-19 and public health measures such as physical distancing and the relaxation of lockdowns around the world.

  // Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain COVID-19 in China
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2293-x
  ref 'Lai_et_al_2020b
    head = From a public health standpoint, our results highlight that countries should consider proactively planning NPIs and relevant resources for containment and mitigation, given how the earlier implementation of NPIs could have lead to significant reductions in size of the outbreak in China. The results here also provide guidance for countries as to the likely effectiveness of different NPIs at different stages of an outbreak. Suspected and confirmed cases should be identified, diagnosed, isolated and reported as early as possible to control the source of infection, and the implementation of cordon sanitaires or travel restrictions for significantly affected areas may prevent seeding the virus to wider regions. Reducing contact and increasing social distance, together with improved personal hygiene can protect vulnerable populations and mitigate COVID-19 spread at the community level, and these interventions should be promoted throughout the outbreak to avoid resurgence.

    >>> Abstract
      On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic1. The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings3. Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data4,5, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.

    let !a self assert =  Reconstruction of COVID-19 spread: The estimated epidemics and peaks were consistent with patterns of reported data by onset date, with high correlations between daily estimates and reported data found across time and regions. The overall correlation between the number of estimated cases and the reported number by province, as of February 29, 2020, was also significant (p<0.001, R2 =0.86), with a high sensitivity (91%, 280/308) and specificity (69%, 22/32) in predicting cities with or without COVID-19 cases.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !b self assert = Quantifying the effect of different NPIs: Without NPIs, as of February 29, the number of COVID-19 cases wouldincrease rapidly across China, with a 51-fold (IQR 33 - 71) increase in Wuhan, a 92-fold (58 - 133) increase in other cities in Hubei, and a 125-fold (77 - 180) increase in other provinces.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !c self assert =  However, the apparent effectiveness of different interventions varied. The lockdown of Wuhan might not have prevented the seeding of the virus from the city, as the travel ban was put in place at the latter stages of pre-CNY population movement out of the city. Nevertheless, if inter-city travel restrictions were not implemented, cities and provinces outside of Wuhan would have received more cases from Wuhan, and the affected geographic range would have expanded to the remote western areas of China.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !d self assert =  Generally, the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to quickly and substantially prevent more infections than contact reduction and social distancing across the country (5-fold versus 2.6-fold). However, without the intervention of contact reductions, in the longer term, the epidemics would increase exponentially across regions. Therefore, combinedNPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment, with about a one-week interval from NPIs to epidemic peak.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !e self assert = Intervention timings: If interventions in China could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, cases could have been dramatically reduced by 66% (IQR 50% - 82%), 86% (81% - 90%), or 95% (93% - 97%), respectively. The geographical range of affected areas would also shrink from 308 cities to 192, 130, and 61 cities, respectively. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later than they were, cases may have shown a 3-fold (IQR 2 - 4), 7-fold (5 - 10), or 18-fold (11 - 26) increase, respectively.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !f self assert = The lifting of travel restrictions: However, if population contact resumed to the normal levels seen in previous years, the lifting of travel restrictions since February 17 might cause case numbers to rise again  Accordingly, our simulations suggest that maintaining social distancing at even a limited degree (e.g. 25% contact reduction on average) through late April would help ensure control of COVID-19 in epicentres like Wuhan. Our estimates were sensitive to the basic reproduction number (R0), with a higher and later peak of epidemics and longer time needed to contain the outbreak under a higher R0. Sensitivity analyses also suggested that our model could have robustly measured relative changes in the efficacy of interventions under different epidemiological parameters and transmission senarios.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !g self assert = Our findings show that combined NPIs substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China. Earlier implementation of NPIs could have significantly reduced the magnitude and geographical range of the outbreak, but equally, a delayed response would have lead to a larger outbreak. Chinas aggressive, multifaceted response is likely to have prevented a far worse situation, which would have accelerated spread globally. The lessons drawn from China provide robust evidence andprovide a preparation window and fighting chance for containing the spread and mi

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !h self assert = Our results suggest three key points. First, they support and validate the idea that population movement and close contact has a major role in the spread of COVID-19 within and beyond China. As the lockdown of Wuhan happened at the latter stages of the pre-CNY movement, travel restrictions did not halt the seeding of the virus from Wuhan, but did prevent cases being exported from Wuhan to a wider area.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !i self assert = Secondly, the importance and effects of the three types of NPIs differed. Compared to travel restrictions, improved detection and isolation of cases as well as the social distancing likely had a greater impact on the containment of outbreak. The social distancing intervention reduced contact with people who travelled from the epicentre of the outbreak. This is likely to have been especially helpful in curbing the spread of an emerging pathogen to the wider community, and reduced the spread risk from asymptomatic or mild infections.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !j self assert = Third, given travel and work resuming in China, the country should consider at least the partial continuation of NPIs to ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak is sustainably controlled for the first wave of this outbreak. For example, early case identification and isolation should be maintained, which may also help to prevent and delay the arrival of a second wave, considering the increasing numbers of cases imported from other countries and the presence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections found in China.

    / May, 2020 - Nature
    let !k self assert = The analyses presented here represent the most comprehensive study yet in which the effect of NPIs on COVID-19 transmission has been quantitatively assessed. The model framework accounts for daily interactions of populations, interventions between and within cities, as well as the inherent statistical uncertainty associated with a paucity of epidemiological parameters, before and after the implementation of interventions. The network-based SEIR model is methodologically robust and built on the basic SEIR models previously used to predict COVID-19 transmission in its early stages. Considering delays in case reporting, our approach can be used for rapid, ongoing estimation of the effectiveness of various NPIs in different countries for outbreakcontrol decision-making.

  // Convalescent plasma treatment of severe COVID-19: A matched control study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20102236
  ref 'Liu_et_al_2020i
    head =    This initial assessment offers evidence in support of convalescent plasma transfusion as an effective intervention in COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation. Preliminary data suggest a potential mortality benefit, but greater numbers are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Interestingly, these data suggest that the survival effect of convalescent plasma may begin to manifest more than 1 week after transfusion. If this observation is borne out in subsequent studies, it could indicate that convalescent plasma prevents longer-term complications, such as acute lung injury or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; however, this speculation awaits confirmation in a larger patient cohort.

    >>> Background
      Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing mass morbidity and mortality. Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls.

    >>> Methods
      Plasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti43 spike antibody titer of ³1:320 dilution. Matched control patients were retrospectively identified within the electronic health record database. Supplemental oxygen requirements and survival were compared between plasma recipients and controls.

    >>> Results
      Convalescent plasma recipients were more likely than control patients to remain the same or have improvements in their supplemental oxygen requirements by post-transfusion day 14, with an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). Plasma recipients also demonstrated improved survival, compared to control patients(log-rank test: p=0.039). In a covariates-adjusted Cox model, convalescent plasma transfusion improved survival for non-intubated patients (hazard ratio 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05 ~0.72); p=0.015), but not for intubated patients (1.24 (0.33~4.67); p=0.752).

    >>> Conclusions
      Convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.

By day 14, clinical condition had worsened in 18.0% of the plasma patients and 24.3% in the control patients (p=0.167, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). The covariates-adjusted odds ratio for worsening oxygenation on day 14 was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). The effect of plasma appeared to be confounded by the use of therapeutic anticoagulants (unadjusted vs. adjusted OR: 0.90 vs. 0.84), but not on other types of drugs or duration of symptoms before admission (OR remained in the range of 0.90~0.91).

  ref 'Peccia_et_al_2020
    head = The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge were tracked throughout a COVID-19 epidemic and compared with traditional outbreak epidemiological indicators. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in primary sludge closely followed the epidemiology curves established by compiled COVID-19 testing data and hospital admissions, but was a leading indicator by seven and three days, respectively.

    >>> Abstract
      We report a time course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge during the Spring COVID-19 outbreak in a northeastern U.S. metropolitan area. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all environmental samples and, when adjusted for the time lag, the virus RNA concentrations were highly correlated with the COVID-19 epidemiological curve (R2=0.99) and local hospital admissions (R2=0.99). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were a seven-day leading indicator ahead of compiled COVID-19 testing data and led local hospital admissions data by three days. Decisions to implement or relax public health measures and restrictions require timely information on outbreak dynamics in a community.

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detectable in all samples tested and ranged from 1.7 x 103 virus RNA copies mL-1 to 4.6 x 105 virus RNA copies mL-1.

A cross correlation analysis resulted in a maximum correlation coefficient (R=0.994) when the COVID-19 testing data is adjusted 7 days forward. Regressing the adjusted COVID-19 testing data and SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA concentrations yield a value of 1,305 virus RNA copies/mL per new COVID-19 case report as the outbreak ascended, and 1,240 virus RNA copies/mL per new COVID-19 case report as the outbreak descended.

  ref 'Beigel_et_al_2020
    head = Preliminary results of this trial suggest that a 10-day course of remdesivir was superior to placebo in the treatment of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

    >>> Background
      Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), none have yet been shown to be efficacious.

    >>> Methods
      We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.

    >>> Results
      A total of 1063 patients underwent randomization. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group. Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04). Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).

    >>> Conclusions
      Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

    let !a self assert =  Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P<0.001).

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !b self assert =  Mortality was numerically lower in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group, but the difference was not significant (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04; 1059 patients). The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% and 11.9% in the remdesivir and placebo groups, respectively. The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days are not reported in this preliminary analysis, given the large number of patients that had yet to complete day 29 visits. An analysis with adjustment for baseline ordinal score as a stratification variable showed a hazard ratio for death of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 to 1.10).

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !c self assert = Serious adverse events occurred in 114 patients (21.1%) in the remdesivir group and 141 patients (27.0%) in the placebo group; 4 events (2 in each group) were judged by site investigators to be related to remdesivir or placebo. There were 28 serious respiratory failure adverse events in the remdesivir group (5.2% of patients) and 42 in the placebo group (8.0% of patients). Acute respiratory failure, hypotension, viral pneumonia, and acute kidney injury were slightly more common among patients in the placebo group. No deaths were considered to be related to treatment assignment, as judged by the site investigators.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !d self assert = Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 156 patients (28.8%) in the remdesivir group and in 172 in the placebo group (33.0%). The most common adverse events in the remdesivir group were anemia or decreased hemoglobin (43 events [7.9%], as compared with 47 [9.0%] in the placebo group); acute kidney injury, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, or increased blood creatinine (40 events [7.4%], as compared with 38 [7.3%]); pyrexia (27 events [5.0%], as compared with 17 [3.3%]); hyperglycemia or increased blood glucose level (22 events [4.1%], as compared with 17 [3.3%]); and increased aminotransferase levels including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or both (22 events [4.1%], as compared with 31 [5.9%]). Otherwise, the incidence of adverse events was not found to be significantly different between the remdesivir group and the placebo group.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !e self assert =  Among patients with a baseline ordinal score of 5 (421 patients), the rate ratio for recovery was 1.47 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.84); among patients with a baseline score of 4 (127 patients) and those with a baseline score of 6 (197 patients), the rate ratio estimates for recovery were 1.38 (95% CI, 0.94 to 2.03) and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.81), respectively. For those receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO at enrollment (baseline ordinal scores of 7; 272 patients), the rate ratio for recovery was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.42). A test of interaction of treatment with baseline score on the ordinal scale was not significant.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !f self assert = The odds of improvement in the ordinal scale score were higher in the remdesivir group, as determined by a proportional odds model at the day 15 visit, than in the placebo group (odds ratio for improvement, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.91; P=0.001; 844 patients)

    let !g self assert = Our findings highlight the need to identify Covid-19 cases and start antiviral treatment before the pulmonary disease progresses to require mechanical ventilation.

    / May, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !h self assert = These preliminary findings support the use of remdesivir for patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19 and require supplemental oxygen therapy. However, given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is clear that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient. Future strategies should evaluate antiviral agents in combination with other therapeutic approaches or combinations of antiviral agents to continue to improve patient outcomes in Covid-19.

  // A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9
  ref 'Chan_et_al_2020
    head = Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions

    >>> Background
      An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.

    >>> Methods
      In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.

    >>> Findings
      From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.

    >>> Interpretation
      Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

    let !a self assert =  Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !b self assert = We report here a familial cluster of unexplained pneumonia due to 2019-nCoV. Six of seven family members had radiological changes of viral pneumonia, among whom five (patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7) tested positive for 2019-nCoV by RT-PCR. Five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7) had associated symptoms at the time of presentation.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !c self assert = Complete genome sequences of the two strains from patients 2 and 5 showed almost complete nucleotide identity with each other, and were closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses reported in 2018.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !d self assert = Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !e self assert = Older patients (aged >60 years) with comorbidities had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The multifocal ground-glass changes on lung CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia. Their lung involvement was also more diffuse and extensive than those of the younger patients, whose blood test results were largely normal.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !f self assert = The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !g self assert =  These findings suggested that person-to-person transmission and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV by air travel are possible, supporting reports of infected Chinese travellers from Wuhan being detected in other geographical regions.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !h self assert = Many of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of this novel coronavirus pneumonia were similar to those of SARS patients in 2003. The incubation period of the Wuhan pneumonia appeared similar to that of SARS. The attack rate is rather high, up to 83% if we included the five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) with unexplained ground-glass radiological changes of the lungs on CT scan as the case definition in this family outbreak after visiting Wuhan.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !i self assert = A rather unexpected finding from the lung CT scan of patient 5, which was done on the insistence by the nervous parents, also showed ground-glass pneumonic changes. Patient 5 was later confirmed virologically to have an asymptomatic infection. Notably, patients 3 and 4 were afebrile at presentation to our hospital. These cryptic cases of walking pneumonia might serve as a possible source to propagate the outbreak. Further studies on the epidemiological significance of these asymptomatic cases are warranted.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !j self assert = Patient 4, who had a history of chronic sinusitis, might have a bacterial superinfection because he had a productive cough instead of a dry cough. He also had a high white blood cell count, although the bacterial test was negative.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !k self assert = Interestingly, the two younger adults (patients 3 and 4) initially had diarrhoea, which was also reported in 10·6% (15 of 142) of our SARS patients at presentation;18 however, the subsequent faecal samples of patients 3 and 4 that were collected 9–10 days after symptom onset were negative for the virus after the diarrhoea had long subsided.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !l self assert = On microbiological testing, we did not find any evidence of other known respiratory viral or bacterial infections, but specific RT-PCR assays for two widely separated genome targets—the highly conserved RdRp and the highly variable S genes—were positive for this novel 2019-nCoV. Two complete genome sequences of this novel coronavirus were recovered from the nasopharyngeal swab of patient 2 and the sputum sample of patient 5 with an earlier cycle threshold value indicating a higher viral load.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !m self assert = Patient 2 had more underlying comorbidities and clinical features and radiological findings of more severe disease than the other patients included here. Moreover, the serum sample of patient 2 was also positive for 2019-nCoV, which might indicate some virus spillover from the more severely infected lung into the systemic circulation, as previously reported in patients with SARS

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !n self assert = Sputum samples were available for testing from patients 5 and 7. The cycle threshold values of the sputum samples were 8–13 cycles earlier than those of throat swabs, indicating higher viral loads detected in the lower respiratory tract. This finding is consistent with the observations in patients with MERS who had higher viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples than in upper respiratory tract samples.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !o self assert = Unlike our patients in the 2003 SARS outbreak,22 we found no evidence of viral shedding in urine and faeces in these six patients. However, improved systematic serial collection and testing of an increased number of such samples is warranted.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !p self assert = Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR amplicon fragments from five of our six patients and the complete virus genome of 29·8 kilobases from patients 2 and 5 showed that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B or subgenus sarbecovirus, which also includes the human SARS coronavirus. The genome of our virus strains are phylogenetically closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses first found in the Chinese horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus, captured in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !q self assert = The full virus genome had about an 89% nucleotide identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45, which makes it a new species. Moreover, the Spike protein of our virus has an 84% nucleotide identity with the bat-SL-CoVZC45 coronavirus and an 78% nucleotide identity with the human SARS coronavirus. Although substantial genetic differences exist between this and other betacoronaviruses, cross reactions in RT-PCR or antibody assays for SARS or other betacoronaviruses are possible if the primers and antigenic epitopes are not carefully chosen, as previously reported.30 Further studies on the optimal diagnostic tests are warranted.

    / January, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !r self assert = As shown in this study, it is still crucial to isolate patients and trace and quarantine contacts as early as possible because asymptomatic infection appears possible (as shown in one of our patients), educate the public on both food and personal hygiene, and alert health-care workers on compliance to infection control to prevent super-spreading events. Unlike the 2003 SARS outbreak, the improved surveillance network and laboratory capability of China was able to recognise this outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome sequences that would allow the development of rapid diagnostic tests and efficient epidemiological control.


  # transmission, Closed environment

  ref 'Nishiura_et_al_2020c
    head = It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

    >>> Objective
      To identify common features of cases with novel coronavirus disease24 (COVID-19) so as to better understand what factors promote secondary transmission including superspreading events.

    >>> Methods
      A total of 110 cases were examined among eleven clusters and sporadic cases, and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data.

    >>> Results
      Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

    >>> Conclusions
      It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

    / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !b self assert = If superspreading events are defined as events where the number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case is greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution (i.e. transmission to three or more persons), then seven of the 110 cases (6.4%) were involved in such events. Six of these events (85.7%) took place in closed environments, and the odds ratio (OR) of superspreading events in closed environments was as high as 32.6 (95% CI: 3.7, 289.5).

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058
  ref 'Qian_et_al_2020
    head = All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

    >>> Background
      By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted.

    >>> Methods
      Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues.

    >>> Results
      Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

    >>> Conclusions
      All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !b self assert = The average number (SD) of cases per outbreak was 3·921·65. Among the 318 identified outbreaks, more than half (171; 53·8%) involved three cases, more than a quarter (84; 26·4%) involved four cases, and only five (1·6%) outbreaks involved ten or more cases.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !c self assert = Among the 318 outbreaks, 129 involved only family members, 133 involved family relatives, 29 involved socially connected individuals, 24 involved socially non-connected, and only three involved multiple relationships. In addition to family members, family relatives and socially connected individuals constituted a large proportion of the infected cases.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !d self assert =  Among the 318 outbreaks, 254 (79·9%) occurred in a home (one in a villa; all others in apartments), 108 (34·0%) in transport, 14 at a restaurant or other food venue, seven at an entertainment venue, and seven at a shopping venue (shopping mall and supermarket), with an additional 26 at a miscellaneous venue (e.g.hospital, hotel room, unspecified community, and thermal power plant).

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !e self assert = Most of the 254 home outbreaks included three to five cases (145 with three cases, 66 with four cases, and 25 with five cases). The average number of cases was 3·7 for the home outbreaks, 3·8 for transport, 4·9 for food venues, 3·6 for entertainment venues, 8·7 for shopping venues, and 4·4 for miscellaneous venues. The proportion of large outbreaks was high for shops and food venues, possibly because more susceptible individuals were present in these venues than in homes. Shopping and entertainment venues were each associated with only seven outbreaks. This seems to suggest the difficulty of implementing preventive measures in places with large numbers of susceptible individuals.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !f self assert = Between 29 December 2019 and 31 January 2020, we also identified 231 outbreaks with known start and end dates of the suspected infectious period. The identified outbreaks peaked between 23 and 28 January (Figure 2A), which coincides with the celebration period of the Chinese New Year (CNY). CNY 2020 lasted from New Year’s Eve on 24 January to the Lantern Festival (i.e., the 15th of Lunar January) on 8 February. The official holiday in mainland China was from 24 to 30 January 2020. The peak date for the number of transport outbreaks was 1 to 2 days earlier than that for the home outbreaks as people travelled home for CNY.

    let !g self assert = We further divided those 126 outbreaks into two subgroups according to the index patient’s symptom-onset date: on or before 28 January (96 outbreaks) and after 28 January (30 outbreaks). The average time from symptom onset to the ending infectious date was 3·76±4·42 days for those on and before 28 January and 0·87±2·80 days for those afterward.

    let !h self assert = Our study does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus. However, among our 7,324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred in a village in Shangqiu, Henan. A 27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with an individual who had returned from Wuhan on 25 January and had the onset of symptoms on 1 February.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !i self assert = The second salient feature of the 318 identified outbreaks is the relatively small number of outbreaks that involved 10 or more cases. The largest outbreak occurred in a Tianjin shopping mall and involved 21 cases, although Wu et al. reported that 25 cases were involved.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !j self assert = The occurrence of many small outbreaks (in number of cases) in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a different transmission pattern from that of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Some virus, epidemiological, and environmental factors could have contributed to this observed difference between the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !k self assert = We do not have data on the hygiene conditions and human density of the infection venues of the 318 outbreaks studied here. The exact location of the infection venues and the necessary parameters such as the floor area or the number of occupants were not provided in the case reports. Instead, we reviewed the current design standards of thermal and ventilation conditions, occupant density and close contact behaviour in the various indoor environments discussed here.  The required ventilation rates vary significantly among homes, offices, trains, and buses. For example, the required ventilation rate is only 3·9 L/s per person in shopping malls and 2·8 L/s per person in public buses, whereas a ventilation rate of 8 to 10 L/s is required for good indoor air quality.26 An international systematic review showed that a rate as high as 25 L/s per person may be needed.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !l self assert = This study shows that the individual indoor environments in which we live and work are the most common venues in which the virus of the once-in-a-century-pandemic is transmitted among us. An individual infected in one building may infect others in the building(s) that he or she later visits. People are in constant contact as they move from one indoor space or building to another, which creates an indoor contact network through which a virus can spread.17 The buildings and transport cabins in various parts of the world are thus connected and facilitated the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic virus.

  ref 'Hamner_et_al_2020
    head = This outbreak of COVID-19 with a high secondary attack rate indicates that SARS-CoV-2 might be highly transmissible in certain settings, including group singing events. This underscores the importance of physical distancing, including maintaining at least 6 feet between persons, avoiding group gatherings and crowded places, and wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain during this pandemic. If this is not feasible, washing hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when ill, and frequently cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces remain critical to reducing transmission The choir mitigated further spread by quickly communicating to its members and notifying SCPH of a cluster of cases on March 18. When first contacted by SCPH during March 18–20, nearly all persons who attended the practice reported they were already self-isolating or quarantining.

Choir members who developed symptoms on March 11 (three) and March 12 (seven) attended both the March 3 and March 10 practices and thus could have been infected earlier and might have been infectious in the 2 days preceding symptom onset (i.e., as early as March 9).

Median age of those who became ill was 69 years, and 85% of cases occurred in women. Excluding the laboratory-confirmed index patient, 52 (86.7%) of 60 attendees became ill; 32 (61.5%) of these cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing and 20 (38.5%) persons were considered to have probable infections.

  // Excess mortality from Covid-19. Weekly excess death rates by age and sex for Sweden.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096909
  ref 'Modig_et_al_2020
    head = From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. The pattern shows that persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and that men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women. Currently this excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 and 2 years for men and women respectively. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on life expectancy will be determined by a complex interplay of several factors. Until now, the Covid-19 pandemic however has already caused a health burden that reached historic extents on the total mortality of the Swedish population.

    >>> Objectives
      Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden.

    >>> Design
      We make use of Swedish register data about total weekly deaths, total population at risk, and estimate age- and sex-specific weekly death rates for 2020 and the 5 previous years. The data is provided by Statistics Sweden.

    >>> Results
      From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women.

    >>> Conclusion
      The Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a clear and consistent effect on total mortality in Sweden, with male death rates being comparably more affected. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on mortality and life expectancy will depend on the progression of the pandemic, the extent that some of the deaths would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic, only somewhat later, the consequences for other health conditions, as well as the health care sector at large.

    let !g self assert = Our results also confirm the sex difference in mortality that are based on death counts and reported since the outbreak of Covid-19. Although subject to fluctuations, the rate ratios of the age-specific death rates show approximately similar general age patterns for men and women. However, the magnitude of excess mortality is higher for men at all ages.

    / May, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !h self assert = We cannot draw any conclusions about whether the mortality difference truly stem from different chances of surviving Covid-19, or a difference in the risk of getting affected, neither can we explain the mechanisms to the observed sex differences Even if the number of confirmed cases is similar for men and women in Sweden, and in other countries, it is still confirmed cases and not all cases. However, based on the confirmed cases it clearly seems as if men have higher fatality. This together with our finding that excess mortality follows the same age-pattern for men and women but with higher levels for men at all ages may suggest biological explanations.

    >>> Abstract
      The host response to viral infection includes the induction of type I interferons and the subsequent upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is an interferon-induced protein that has been implicated as a central player in the host antiviral response. Over the past 15 years, efforts to understand how ISG15 protects the host during infection have revealed that its actions are diverse and pathogen-dependent. In this Review, we describe new insights into how ISG15 directly inhibits viral replication and discuss the recent finding that ISG15 modulates the host damage and repair response, immune response and other host signalling pathways. We also explore the viral immune-evasion strategies that counteract the actions of ISG15. These findings are integrated with a discussion of the recent identification of ISG15-deficient individuals and a cellular receptor for ISG15 that provides new insights into how ISG15 shapes the host response to viral infection.

The application of novel proteome analyses will be crucial for determining the conjugation preference, scope and potential biological outcomes of protein ISGylation.

    >>> Abstract
      The disinfection industry would greatly benefit from efficient, robust, high-power deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV–C LEDs). However, the performance of UV–C AlGaN LEDs is limited by poor light-extraction efficiency (LEE) and the presence of a large density of threading dislocations. We demonstrate high power AlGaN LEDs grown on SiC with high LEE and low threading dislocation density. We employ a crack-free AlN buffer layer with low threading dislocation density and a technique to fabricate thin-film UV LEDs by removing the SiC substrate, with a highly selective SF6 etch. The LEDs (278 nm) have a turn-on voltage of 4.3 V and a CW power of 8 mW (82 mW/mm2) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8% at 95 mA. KOH submicron roughening of the AlN surface (nitrogen-polar) and improved p-contact reflectivity are found to be effective in improving the LEE of UV light.

    >>> Abstract
      Homeostasis is a key feature of the cellular lifespan. Its maintenance influences the rate of ageing and it is determined by several factors, including efficient proteolysis. The proteasome is the major cellular proteolytic machinery responsible for the degradation of both normal and damaged proteins. Alterations of proteasome function have been recorded in various biological phenomena including ageing and replicative senescence. Proteasome activities and function are decreased upon replicative senescence, whereas proteasome activation confers enhanced survival against oxidative stress, lifespan extension and maintenance of the young morphology longer in human primary fibroblasts. Several natural compounds possess anti-ageing/anti-oxidant properties. In this study, we have identified quercetin (QUER) and its derivative, namely quercetin caprylate (QU-CAP) as a proteasome activator with anti-oxidant properties that consequently influence cellular lifespan, survival and viability of HFL-1 primary human fibroblasts. Moreover, when these compounds are supplemented to already senescent fibroblasts, a rejuvenating effect is observed. Finally, we show that these compounds promote physiological alterations when applied to cells (i.e. whitening effect). In summary, these data demonstrate the existence of naturally occurring anti-ageing products that can be effectively used through topical application.

We found this was a component of Rhodiola kirilowii, which has been used in Chinese medicine for treating hepatitis and tuberculosis. These two compounds and the luteolin-related, FDA-approved quecertin, have potential for use in the clinical treatment of SARS.

    >>> Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the pathogen of SARS, which caused a global panic in 2003. We describe here the screening of Chinese herbal medicine-based, novel small molecules that bind avidly with the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV and thus can interfere with the entry of the virus to its host cells. We achieved this by using a two-step screening method consisting of frontal affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with a viral infection assay based on a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus. Two small molecules, tetra-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose (TGG) and luteolin, were identified, whose anti-SARS-CoV activities were confirmed by using a wild-type SARS-CoV infection system. TGG exhibits prominent anti-SARS-CoV activity with a 50% effective concentration of 4.5 μM and a selective index of 240.0. The two-step screening method described here yielded several small molecules that can be used for developing new classes of anti-SARS-CoV drugs and is potentially useful for the high-throughput screening of drugs inhibiting the entry of HIV, hepatitis C virus, and other insidious viruses into their host cells.
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease that spread to more than two-dozen countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe in the spring of 2003. Approximately 8,400 people worldwide suffered from SARS and more than 900 died according to a report of the World Health Organization executive board on 27 November 2003. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the pathogen that caused SARS. SARS-CoV is highly infectious and is transmitted via the respiratory route. Although the first outbreak is over, it is possible that even a low-level epidemic or accidental infection, as recently happened in Singapore and Taiwan, could cause a sudden worldwide epidemic. At present, few drugs are available for treating SARS. Ribavirin was initially used, but it proved to be barely effective and had serious side effects. Cinatl et al. reported recently that interferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV potency and that glycyrrhizin had an anti-SARS-CoV activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 300 mg/liter (364.5 μM).
      We have targeted our drug discovery to small molecules that can inhibit SARS-CoV from entering its host cells. Virus entry is an attractive target step for therapy because it can block the propagation of virus at an early stage, thus minimizing the chance for the virus to evolve and acquire drug resistance. Inhibitors of the entry of several important viruses have been developed. For example, a new class of virus entry inhibitors has been developed for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and one of these, T20 (enfuvirtide), is now in clinical usage. For the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the small molecules RFI 641 and VP-14637 have been developed to inhibit its entry process. For herpes simplex virus, entry inhibitors such as FGF4 signal peptide  and n-docosanol are under development.
      We have developed a two-step screening method combining frontal affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry (FAC/MS) and pseudotyped virus infection assay to search for drugs that can interfere with the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells. FAC/MS allows for competitive assays of interacting molecules, such as enzymes and ligands, as well as for a quick analysis and direct presentation of the assay. Here, in the first step, we use the FAC/MS to perform high-throughput screening of small molecules that can bind with high affinity to the SARS-CoV S2 protein. The other rationale of our study is that some of these S2-binding molecules may interfere with the function of the S protein, thus preventing the SARS-CoV from entering its host cells. To test this, we developed an HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus that can infect Vero E6 cells resulting in the cellular expression of luciferase that can be detected by luminometry. Thus, as a second step, we used HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus to check the function of the small molecules obtained in the first step. This system is highly sensitive, rapid, and reproducible; the materials are safe to handle and can be used for high-throughput screening.
      We used the FAC/MS approach to screen small molecule libraries consisting of extracts from 121 Chinese herbs, including Prunella vulgaris and Saussurea lappa Clarks, that exhibited antiviral activities against HIV-1, RSV, and hepatitis B virus. We identified two small molecules that bind avidly to the SARS S2 protein and can interfere with the entry of SARS-CoV into Vero E6 cells, with potent antiviral activities against wild-type SARS-CoV with EC50 values of 4.5 and 10.6 μM.

Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds. The optimal lozenge composition and dosage scheme need to be investigated further.

    >>> Objective
      To compare the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges with zinc gluconate lozenges in common cold treatment and to examine the dose-dependency of the effect.

    >>> Setting
      Placebo-controlled zinc lozenge trials, in which the zinc dose was > 75 mg/day. The pooled effect of zinc lozenges on common cold duration was calculated by using inverse-variance random-effects method.

    >>> Participants
      Seven randomised trials with 575 participants with naturally acquired common colds.

    >>> Results
      The mean common cold duration was 33% (95% CI 21% to 45%) shorter for the zinc groups of the seven included trials. Three trials that used lozenges composed of zinc acetate found that colds were shortened by 40% and four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28%. The difference between the two salts was not significant: 12 percentage points (95% CI: -12 to + 36). Five trials used zinc doses of 80-92 mg/day, common cold duration was reduced by 33%, and two trials used zinc doses of 192-207 mg/day and found an effect of 35%. The difference between the high-dose and low-dose zinc trials was not significant: 2 percentage points (95% CI: -29 to + 32).

       Properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges. There is no evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold. Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds. The optimal lozenge composition and dosage scheme need to be investigated further.

    >>> Abstract
      We have utilized an experimental model of human zinc deficiency for study of cytokines production by TH1 and TH2 cells. Additionally, we determined ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ and CD4+ CD45RA+ to CD4+CD45RO+ cells and percentages of CD73+ T cytolytic cells in the CD8+ subset. The data were collected during baseline, at the end of the zinc-restricted period, and following zinc repletion. Our results showed that functions of TH1 cells, as evidenced by production of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were decreased, whereas functions of TH2 cells (production of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) were unaffected by zinc deficiency. Thus an imbalance between TH1 and TH2 cells resulted because of zinc deficiency in humans. Our studies also showed that zinc may be required for regeneration of new CD4+ T lymphocytes and maintenance of T cytolytic cells. We conclude that an imbalance between TH1 and TH2 cells, decreased recruitment of T naive cells, and decreased percentage of T cytolytic cells may account for decreased cell-mediated immune functions in zinc-deficient subjects.

  // Effects of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Epigenetic Aging in Overweight and Obese African Americans With Suboptimal Vitamin D Status: A Randomized Clinical Trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/gly223
  ref 'Chen_et_al_2019
    head = DNAm age estimated by either Horvath clock or Hannum clock was highly correlated with chronological age in African Americans with suboptimal vitamin D status at the baseline. Vitamin D3 supplementation decreased DNA methylation aging. More specifically, the epigenetic aging was significantly decreased by 4,000 IU/d vitamin D3 supplementation according to the Horvath clock, and 2,000 IU/d was more effective according to the Hannum clock. Moreover, serum 25 (OH)D levels were only negatively associated with DNA methylation aging measured by the Horvath clock.

    >>> Background
      We have previously shown that vitamin D supplementation increases telomerase activity, suggesting an anti-aging effect. In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation would slow down epigenetic aging, a new marker of biological aging.

    >>> Methods
      A randomized clinical trial was previously conducted among 70 overweight/obese African Americans with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50 nmol/L, who were randomly assigned into four groups of 600 IU/d, 2,000 IU/d, 4,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 supplements or placebo followed by 16-week interventions. Whole genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted in 51 participants. DNA methylation ages were calculated according to the Horvath and the Hannum methods. Methylation-based age acceleration index (∆Age) is defined as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age in years. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the treatment effects.

    >>> Results
      Fifty-one participants (aged 26.1 ± 9.3 years, 16% are male) were included in the study. After the adjustment of multi-covariates, vitamin D3 supplementation of 4,000 IU/d was associated with 1.85 years decrease in Horvath epigenetic aging compared with placebo (p value = .046), and 2,000 IU/d was associated with 1.90 years decrease in Hannum epigenetic aging (p value = .044). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with decreased Horvath ∆Age only (p values = .002), regardless of treatments.

    >>> Conclusion
      Our results suggest that vitamin D supplementation may slow down Horvath epigenetic aging. But the effect on Hannum epigenetic aging is not conclusive. Large-scale and longer duration clinical trials are needed to replicate the findings.

These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

    >>> Abstract
      We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections. ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

    >>> Abstract
      To investigate the effects of calcitriol on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 in diabetic nephropathy. Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were treated with calcitriol for 16 weeks. ACE/ACE2 and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) enzymes were measured in the kidneys of diabetic rats and rat renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to high glucose. Calcitriol reduced proteinuria in diabetic rats without affecting calcium-phosphorus metabolism. ACE and ACE2 levels were significantly elevated in diabetic rats compared to those in control rats. The increase in ACE levels was greater than that of ACE2, leading to an elevated ACE/ACE2 ratio. Calcitriol reduced ACE levels and ACE/ACE2 ratio and increased ACE2 levels in diabetic rats. Similarly, high glucose up-regulated ACE expression in NRK-52E cells, which was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor FR180204 or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. High glucose down-regulated ACE2 expression, which was blocked by FR180204, but not SB203580 or SP600125. Incubation of cells with calcitriol significantly inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK phosphorylation, but not JNK phosphorylation, and effectively attenuated ACE up-regulation and ACE2 down-regulation in high glucose conditions. The renoprotective effects of calcitriol in diabetic nephropathy were related to the regulation of tubular levels of ACE and ACE2, possibly by p38 MAPK or ERK, but not JNK pathways.

We then further explored the potential mechanisms and showed that SHR exhibited overactivated classical RAS with increased expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II production, whereas the counteracting arm of traditional RAS, ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR, was impaired in the SHR brain.

    >>> Abstract
      Hypertension is one of the major predisposing factors for neurodegenerative disease characterized with activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in both periphery and brain. Vitamin D (VitD) is recently recognized as a pleiotropic hormone with strong neuroprotective properties. While multiple lines of evidence suggest that VitD can act on RAS, the evidence concerning the crosstalk between VitD and RAS in the brain is limited. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether VitD can modulate brain RAS to trigger neuroprotective actions in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Our data showed that calcitriol treatment induced VDR expression and inhibited neural death in the prefrontal cortex of SHR. Sustained calcitriol administration also inhibited microglia M1 polarization, but enhanced M2 polarization, accompanied with decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We then further explored the potential mechanisms and showed that SHR exhibited overactivated classical RAS with increased expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II production, whereas the counteracting arm of traditional RAS, ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR, was impaired in the SHR brain. Calcitriol nonsignificantly suppressed AT1 and ACE but markedly reduced Ang II formation. Intriguingly, calcitriol exerted pronouncedly impact on ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR axis with enhanced expression of ACE2, MasR and Ang(1–7) generation. Meanwhile, calcitriol ameliorated the overactivation of NADPH-oxidase (Nox), the downstream of RAS, in SHR, and also mitigated oxidative stress. In microglial (BV2) cells, we further found that calcitriol induced ACE2 and MasR with no significant impact on ACE and AT1. In accordance, calcitriol also attenuated Ang II-induced Nox activation and ROS production, and shifted the microglia polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype. However, co-treatment with A779, a specific MasR antagonist, abrogated the antioxidant and neuroimmune modulating actions of VitD. These findings strongly indicate the involvement of ACE2/Ang(1–7)/MasR pathway in the neuroprotective mechanisms of VitD in the hypertensive brain.

  ref 'Xu_et_al_2017
    head = ALI is a feature of LPS-induced sepsis, therefore, the present study employed a LPS-induced sepsis model to investigate the function of vitamin D in ALI. The results demonstrated that LPS stimulation led to lung cell death and increased vascular permeability, which may partially occur by inducing the expression of renin, ACE, Ang II and AT1R, and inhibiting ACE2 expression. However, in vivo and in vitro results indicated that a vitamin D agonist, calcitriol, significantly alleviated LPS-induced ALI to protect lungs.

    >>> Abstract
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the clinical manifestations of severe lung damage and respiratory failure. ALI and ARDS result are associated with high mortality in patients. At present, no effective treatments for ALI and ARDS exist. It is established that vitamin D exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, however, the specific effect of vitamin D on ALI remains largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether, and by which mechanism, vitamin D alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. The results demonstrated that a vitamin D agonist, calcitriol, exhibited a beneficial effect on LPS-induced ALI in rats; calcitriol pretreatment significantly improved LPS-induced lung permeability, as determined using Evans blue dye. Results from reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and ELISA analysis demonstrated that calcitriol also modulated the expression of members of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin (Ang) I-converting enzymes (ACE and ACE2), renin and Ang II, which indicates that calcitriol may exert protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury, at least partially, by regulating the balance between the expression of members of the RAS. The results of the present study may provide novel targets for the future treatment of ALI.

    head = In this individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of experiencing at least one acute respiratory tract infection. Subgroup analysis revealed that daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation without additional bolus doses protected against acute respiratory tract infection, whereas regimens containing large bolus doses did not.

    >>> Objective
      To assess the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of acute respiratory tract infection, and to identify factors modifying this effect.

    >>> Data Sources
      Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) from randomised controlled trials.

    >>> Eligibility criteria for study selection
      Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 of any duration were eligible for inclusion if they had been approved by a research ethics committee and if data on incidence of acute respiratory tract infection were collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome.

    >>> Results
      25 eligible randomised controlled trials (total 11 321 participants, aged 0 to 95 years) were identified. IPD were obtained for 10 933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all participants (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analysis, protective effects were seen in those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for interaction=0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53) than in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≥25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.

    >>> Conclusions
      Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall. Patients who were very vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit.

    head =  We report that a polymorphism in VDR (Vitamin D receptor) independently associates with susceptibility to URI (upper respiratory infections) in both adults and children. Given that the VDR is exclusively involved in vitamin D signalling, our findings lend weight to the growing body of evidence suggesting a role for the vitamin D pathway in mediating protection against respiratory infections.

    >>> Abstract
      SNP in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene is associated with risk of lower respiratory infections. The influence of genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway resulting in susceptibility to upper respiratory infections (URI) has not been investigated. We evaluated the influence of thirty-three SNP in eleven vitamin D pathway genes (DBP, DHCR7, RXRA, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, CYP3A4, CYP27A1, LRP2, CUBN and VDR) resulting in URI risk in 725 adults in London, UK, using an additive model with adjustment for potential confounders and correction for multiple comparisons. Significant associations in this cohort were investigated in a validation cohort of 737 children in Manchester, UK. In all, three SNP in VDR (rs4334089, rs11568820 and rs7970314) and one SNP in CYP3A4 (rs2740574) were associated with risk of URI in the discovery cohort after adjusting for potential confounders and correcting for multiple comparisons (adjusted incidence rate ratio per additional minor allele ≥1·15, Pfor trend ≤0·030). This association was replicated for rs4334089 in the validation cohort (Pfor trend=0·048) but not for rs11568820, rs7970314 or rs2740574. Carriage of the minor allele of the rs4334089 SNP in VDR was associated with increased susceptibility to URI in children and adult cohorts in the United Kingdom.

Each increase in DHCR7/CYP2R1 allele score was associated with a 1.9 nmol/L lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and with increased all cause, cancer, and other mortality but not with cardiovascular mortality. The odds ratio for a genetically determined 20 nmol/L lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 1.30 (1.05 to 1.61) for all cause mortality, with a corresponding observational multivariable adjusted odds ratio of 1.21 (1.11 to 1.31). Corresponding genetic and observational odds ratios were 0.77 (0.55 to 1.08) and 1.13 (1.03 to 1.24) for cardiovascular mortality, 1.43 (1.02 to 1.99) and 1.10 (1.02 to 1.19) for cancer mortality, and 1.44 (1.01 to 2.04) and 1.17 (1.06 to 1.29) for other mortality. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses.

    >>> Conclusions
      Genetically low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were associated with increased all cause mortality, cancer mortality, and other mortality but not with increased cardiovascular mortality. These findings are compatible with the notion that genetically low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations may be causally associated with cancer and other mortality but also suggest that the observational association with cardiovascular mortality could be the result of confounding.

Secondly, vitamin D has been implicated in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in several cell types. Thirdly, animal studies indicate that knockout of the vitamin D receptor may reduce lifespan and accelerate ageing.

    >>> Abstract
      1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] regulates calcium homeostasis and controls cellular differentiation and proliferation. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand-regulated transcription factor that recognizes cognate vitamin D response elements (VDREs) formed by direct or everted repeats of PuG(G/T)TCA motifs separated by 3 or 6 bp (DR3 or ER6). Here, we have identified direct 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes by combining 35,000+ gene microarrays and genome-wide screens for consensus DR3 and ER6 elements, and DR3 elements containing single nucleotide substitutions. We find that the effect of a nucleotide substitution on VDR binding in vitro does not predict VDRE function in vivo, because substitutions that disrupted binding in vitro were found in several functional elements. Hu133A microarray analyses, performed with RNA from human SCC25 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, identified more than 900 regulated genes. VDREs lying within −10 to +5 kb of 5′-ends were assigned to 65% of these genes, and VDR binding was confirmed to several elements in vivo. A screen of the mouse genome identified more than 3000 conserved VDREs, and 158 human genes containing conserved elements were 1,25(OH2)D3-regulated on Hu133A microarrays. These experiments also revealed 16 VDREs in 11 of 12 genes induced more than 10-fold in our previous microarray study, five elements in the human gene encoding the epithelial calcium channel TRPV6, as well as novel 1,25(OH2)D3 target genes implicated in regulation of cell cycle progression. The combined approaches used here thus provide numerous insights into the direct target genes underlying the broad physiological actions of 1,25(OH)2D3.

      Obesity is associated with vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

    >>> Objective
      This study assessed whether obesity alters the cutaneous production of vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) or the intestinal absorption of vitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol).

    >>> Design
      Healthy, white, obese [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) > or = 30] and matched lean control subjects (BMI </= 25) received either whole-body ultraviolet radiation or a pharmacologic dose of vitamin D(2) orally.

    >>> Results
      Obese subjects had significantly lower basal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and higher parathyroid hormone concentrations than did age-matched control subjects. Evaluation of blood vitamin D(3) concentrations 24 h after whole-body irradiation showed that the incremental increase in vitamin D(3) was 57% lower in obese than in nonobese subjects. The content of the vitamin D(3) precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin of obese and nonobese subjects did not differ significantly between groups nor did its conversion to previtamin D(3) after irradiation in vitro. The obese and nonobese subjects received an oral dose of 50000 IU (1.25 mg) vitamin D(2). BMI was inversely correlated with serum vitamin D(3) concentrations after irradiation (r = -0.55, P: = 0.003) and with peak serum vitamin D(2) concentrations after vitamin D(2) intake (r = -0.56, P: = 0.007).

    >>> Conclusions
      Obesity-associated vitamin D insufficiency is likely due to the decreased bioavailability of vitamin D(3) from cutaneous and dietary sources because of its deposition in body fat compartments.

    >>> Abstract
      Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and insufficiency (VDI) are increasing at a global level, and they are associated with increased risk of various diseases. However, little information is available on the prevalence and predictors of VDD and VDI in a representative population of US adults. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements were collected from 26 010 adults aged ≥18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2010. Using thresholds recommended by the Endocrine Society, VDD was defined as 25(OH)D<50 nmol/l and VDI as 50≤25(OH)D<75 nmol/l. Weighted multinomial log-binomial regression was conducted to estimate prevalence ratios of VDD and VDI. The prevalences of VDD and VDI in 2001-2010 were 28·9 and 41·4 %, respectively. Adults who were black, less educated, poor, obese, current smokers, physically inactive and infrequent milk consumers had a higher prevalence of VDD. After adjustment for other potential predictors, obese adults showed 3·09 times higher prevalence of VDD and 1·80 times higher prevalence of VDI than non-obese adults. Physically inactive adults had 2·00 and 1·36 times higher prevalence of VDD and VDI than active peers. Compared with frequent consumers, rare consumers of milk had 2·44 and 1·25 times higher prevalence of VDD and VDI, respectively. Current alcohol drinkers had 38 % lower prevalence of VDD than non-drinkers. Awareness of the high prevalence of VDD and VDI among US adults and related predictors could inform behavioural and dietary strategies for preventing VDD and monitoring VDI, especially in old, black, obese and inactive individuals who report rare consumption of milk.

    >>> Abstract
      This is a retrospective cohort study which included two cohorts (active and expired) of 780 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia. Age, sex, co-morbidity, Vitamin D status, and disease outcome (mortality) were extracted from electronic medical records. The aim was to determine patterns of mortality and associated factors, with a special focus on Vitamin D status. Results revealed that majority of the death cases were male and older and had pre-existing condition and below normal Vitamin D serum level. Univariate analysis revealed that older and male cases with pre-existing condition and below normal Vitamin D levels were associated with increasing odds of death. When controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, Vitamin D status is strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality outcome of cases.

  ref 'Alipio_et_al_2020
    head = Of the 212 cases of COVID-19, majority had ordinary clinical outcome. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 23.8 ng/ml. Serum 25(OH)D level was lowest in critical cases, but highest in mild cases. Serum 25(OH)D levels were statistically significant among clinical outcomes. Majority had insufficient Vitamin D status, most of them were not severe. Vitamin D status is significantly associated with clinical outcomes.

    >>> Abstract
      The rapid spread of COVID-19 in many areas of the world calls for preventive health measures. Although basic guidelines on infection control are suggested, treatment has remained the best choice to avert mortality. However, for the time being, there are no known vaccines for the disease. In this paper, a multinomial logistic regression was used to predict clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19 based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, the barometer for Vitamin D status. A retrospective multicentre study of 212 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. Data pertaining to clinical features and serum 25(OH)D levels were extracted from the medical records. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U and χ² tests were used to compare differences in the clinical outcomes. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the association between serum 25(OH)D level and clinical outcomes of the cases. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. Mean was used for continuous variables. A p-value below 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Of the 212 cases of COVID-19, majority had ordinary clinical outcome. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 23.8 ng/ml. Serum 25(OH)D level was lowest in critical cases, but highest in mild cases. Serum 25(OH)D levels were statistically significant among clinical outcomes. Majority had insufficient Vitamin D status, most of them were not severe. Vitamin D status is significantly associated with clinical outcomes. A multinomial logistic regression analysis reported that for each standard deviation increase in serum 25(OH)D, the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a severe outcome were approximately 7.94 times (OR=0.126, p<0.001) while interestingly, the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a critical outcome were approximately 19.61 times (OR=0.051, p<0.001). The results suggest that an increase in serum 25(OH)D level in the body could either improve clinical outcomes or mitigate worst (severe to critical) outcomes, while a decrease in serum 25(OH)D level in the body could worsen clinical outcomes of COVID-2019 patients. In conclusion, this study provides substantial information to clinicians and health policy-makers. Vitamin D supplementation could possibly improve clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19. Further research should conduct randomized controlled trials and large population studies to evaluate this recommendation.

  ref 'Zhao_et_al_2020b
    head = In this study, we found that ABO blood groups displayed different association risks for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19. Specifically, blood group A was associated with an increased risk whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, thus demonstrating that the ABO blood type is a biomarker for differential susceptibility of COVID-19.

    >>> Abstract
      The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading around the world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO. Here, we compared the ABO blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. The results showed that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.

  // Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02015-19
  ref 'Wan_et_al_2019
    head = We first demonstrated that a MERS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing MAb binds to the RBD region of MERS-CoV spike and further showed that the MAb mediates MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry into Fc receptor-expressing human cells. Moreover, a SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing MAb mediates ADE of SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry. These results demonstrated that ADE of coronaviruses is mediated by neutralizing MAbs that target the RBD of coronavirus spikes.

    >>>
      Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been a major concern for epidemiology, vaccine development, and antibody-based drug therapy. However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies.

    let !d self assert =  In order to trigger conformational changes of coronavirus spikes, MAbs need to bind to the receptor-binding region in their RBD and stabilize the RBD in the standing-up position.

    let !e self assert = RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs bind to the same region on coronavirus spikes as viral receptors do, trigger conformational changes of the spikes as viral receptors do, and mediate ADE through the same pathways as viral-receptor-dependent viral entry. In other words, RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs mediate ADE of coronavirus entry by functionally mimicking viral receptors.

    let !f self assert = Our findings not only reveal a novel molecular mechanism for ADE of coronaviruses but also provide general guidelines on viral vaccine design and antibody-based antiviral drug therapy. As we have shown here, RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs may mediate ADE of viruses by mimicking the functions of viral receptors. Neutralizing MAbs targeting other parts of viral spikes would be less likely to mediate ADE if they do not trigger the conformational changes of the spikes.

  // Global Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Subtype with Spike Protein Mutation D614G is Shaped by Human Genomic Variations that Regulate Expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 Genes
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075911
  ref 'Bhattacharyya_et_al_2020
    head = We performed analysis on publicly available data of RNA sequences of SARS-Cov-2 isolates to correlate pathogen evolution with disease transmission. We have shown that a particular subtype −A2a − that rose in frequency in East Asia in January 2020, has spread rapidly through the European and North American continents. The spread of A2a has been so explosive, that in 10 weeks (of February and March 2020) over 60% of humans were infected with A2a starting from only 2%. The A2a subtype acquired few mutations during the transmission, even lesser in Europe.

    >>> Abstract
      COVID-19 pandemic is a major human tragedy. Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other preexisting subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.

D614G mutation introduces an additional cleavage site in the S protein that is specific for elastase, a serine protease, generally produced by the neutrophils. Sequential digestion at multiple sites on the S1-S2 junction of S protein is necessary for SARS-CoV-2, to enter into the host cell.

Multiple digestions at the S1-S2 junction region produce “decoy” fragments which reduces host immune response by binding and inactivating antiviral antibodies giving the virion an advantage to overcome the first line of host defence. It has been shown that for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are indispensable, while endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) are not.

The SRCR domain interacts with external pathogens and helps in positioning of the protease head towards the substrate.

    let !g self assert =  The SARS-CoV-2 A2a subtype specific D614G mutation is in a region of the S protein that is highly conserved across the coronavirus family. We predict that the V160M mutation in the host and D614G mutation in the A2a subtype will result in reduced interaction of the SRCR domain of TMPRSS2 and the S protein of the coronavirus leading to a reduction in viral entry in the host cell. High prevalence of the V160M mutation in populations of East Asia is a likely reason for the reduced spread of A2a subtype in East Asia.

Those correlated strongly with virus neutralizing antibodies detected by a PRNT assay.  Since the majority of the human population has antibodies against the four endemic human coronaviruses, it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false positive results.

    >>> Abstract
      A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic. Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.

    >>> Objective
      A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease due to a novel betacoronavirus, human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), has emerged recently. HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 in Hong Kong. We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood donors in Southern China to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of HCoV-EMC and related viruses into humans.

    >>> Methods
      Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests.

    >>> Results
      Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of ≥1:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of <1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had significant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein. Virulence of SARS-CoV over other betacoronaviruses may boost cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against other betacoronaviruses.

    >>> Conclusion
      Convalescent SARS sera may contain cross-reactive antibodies against other betacoronaviruses and confound seroprevalence study for HCoV-EMC.

We assayed over 10(8) antibody-peptide interactions in 569 humans across four continents, nearly doubling the number of previously established viral epitopes. We detected antibodies to an average of 10 viral species per person and 84 species in at least two individuals. Although rates of specific virus exposure were heterogeneous across populations, antibody responses targeted strongly conserved "public epitopes" for each virus, suggesting that they may elicit highly similar antibodies. VirScan is a powerful approach for studying interactions between the virome and the immune system.

The fact that it did not enhance the responses of older adults indicates that this effect requires a robust immune system, which is interesting in that it largely confines the benefits of infection to those of child-bearing age. Finally, while CMV is clearly a pathogen for immunodeficient individuals and some infants, the data presented here indicate that it is beneficial to a great many more people.


    >>> Abstract
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta-herpes virus present in a latent form in most people worldwide. In immunosuppressed individuals, CMV can reactivate and cause serious clinical complications, but the effect of the latent state on healthy people remains elusive. We undertook a systems approach to understand the differences between seropositive and negative subjects and measured hundreds of immune system components from blood samples including cytokines and chemokines, immune cell phenotyping, gene expression, ex vivo cell responses to cytokine stimuli and the antibody response to seasonal influenza vaccination. As expected, we found decreased responses to vaccination and an overall down-regulation of immune components in aged individuals regardless of CMV serostatus. In contrast, CMV-infected young adults exhibited an overall up-regulation of immune components including enhanced antibody responses to influenza vaccination, increased CD8+ T cell sensitivity, and elevated levels of circulating IFN-γ compared to uninfected individuals. Experiments with young mice infected with murine CMV also showed significant protection from an influenza virus challenge compared with uninfected animals, although this effect declined with time. These data show that CMV and its murine equivalent can have a beneficial effect on the immune response of young, healthy individuals, which may explain the continued coexistence of CMV and mammals throughout their evolution.

      Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range (IQR), 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).

    head = As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded.

    >>> Background
      Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.

    >>> Methods
      We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Findings
      As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days.

    >>> Interpretation
      SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

      The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.

    head = In total, 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been identified among residents, personnel, and visitors as of March 18, and 30 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in King County had identified at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. Staff working in multiple facilities while ill and transfers of patients from one facility to another potentially introduced Covid-19 into some of these facilities.

    >>> Background
      Long-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.

    >>> Methods
      After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.

    >>> Results
      As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.

    >>> Conclusion
      In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.

    >>> Abstract
      At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is rampaging around the world. However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and management. Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID‐19 patients. The discovery of the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts. In addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find asymptomatic carriers as early as possible. In conclusion, the prevention and control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers.

    head = Total of 115 COVID-19 cases were reported in in 33 clusters in Tianjin. Clusters can be classified as following: 28 familial clusters (71 cases), 1 work place cluster (10 cases), 3 transport vehicle clusters (8 cases) and 1 public place cluster (26 cases). Fourteen familial clusters were caused by the cases from the working place or public place clusters. Numbers of secondary cases of family clusters were 1-7, the median number was 7.The interval from onset to diagnosis for the first case was longer than those of other cases in the familial clusters (Z=-2.406, P= 0.016).

    >>> Objective
      To understand the characteristics of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, and provide epidemiological evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      The data of all the cluster cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin reported as 22 February 2020 were collected to analyze the characteristics of different types of the clusters.

    >>> Results
       Total of 115 COVID-19 cases were reported in in 33 clusters in Tianjin.

Numbers of secondary cases of family clusters were 1-7, the median number was 7.The interval from onset to diagnosis for the first case was longer than those of other cases in the familial clusters (Z=-2.406, P= 0.016). The median of incubation period of the public place clusters was 2 days. The intervals from onset to diagnosis were significant different among the family, working place and public place clusters (H=8.843, , P=0.012) , and there were also significant differences in onset time among the secondary cases (H=16.607, P=0.000) .

    >>> Conclusion
       In the surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic, special attention should be paid to the cases from same family, same work place, or other places where clustering are prone to occur, and the epidemiological investigation should be carried out timely to confirm the cluster. To prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the close contacts of the patients should be transferred to an assigned observation place in time for single room isolation. The awareness of COVID-19 prevention is low in some rural areas, reflected by many mass gathering activities and delayed medical care seeking after onset. It is necessary to strengthen the health education and take control measures in early period of epidemic.

The incidence and mortality rates were correlated with DCI, especially in countries with local transmission.

    >>> Abstract
      It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays.

    >>> Findings
      Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19.

    head = The structure of the COVID-19 virus nsp12 contains a right-hand RdRp domain (residues S367 to F920) and a nidovirus-specific N-terminal extension domain (residues D60 to R249) that adopts a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) (10) architecture.

    >>> Abstract
      A novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] outbreak has caused a global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [(RdRp), also named nsp12] is the central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, and it appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug remdesivir. We report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of COVID-19 virus full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-angstrom resolution. In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase. The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics that target viral RdRp.

On the basis of statistical tests of association carried out with general linear models, we found that the unprecedented Wuhan city travel ban (affecting 11 million people) slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 3 days, delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China.

    / May, 2020 - Nat Rev Phys
    let !b self assert = We found, too, that Chinese cities that pre-emptively implemented control measures — such as suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings — reported in the first week of their outbreaks one-third fewer cases than cities that started control later.

    let !d self assert = The average transmissibility of a pathogen is quantified by its basic reproduction number, R0, which is a bedrock concept in infectious disease dynamics. Yet biological, social and environmental factors — aided by a good dose of happenstance — give rise to significant individual variation around this average.

    / May, 2020 - Nat Rev Phys
    let !e self assert = Mathematically, for a given R0, a pathogen with more superspreaders must also have more infected individuals who do not contribute to onward spread. Such individual variation makes transmission chains more likely to die out, and outbreaks rarer but more explosive, than if every case was an average transmitter. This variation matters most when case numbers are small as countries try to prevent establishment of community transmission.

    let !f self assert = Our group recently modelled a classical intervention against infectious diseases: contact tracing and isolation, in which the contacts of known cases are found, and, if they show symptoms, are isolated quickly. Doing so therefore decreases the average number of new infections that each infected person creates, a quantity modellers call the reproduction number. By developing a model for this system, we were able to determine what fraction of a case’s contacts must be found and isolated to control a new outbreak, based on the best-possible information on transmission and disease available at that time.

    head = Virus-laden small (<5 μm) aerosolized droplets can remain in the air and travel long distances, >1 m. Potential aerosol transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses has been reported. However, none of the staff or other diners in restaurant X were infected. Moreover, the smear samples from the air conditioner were all nucleotide negative. This finding is less consistent with aerosol transmission. However, aerosols would tend to follow the airflow, and the lower concentrations of aerosols at greater distances might have been insufficient to cause infection in other parts of the restaurant.

      During January 26–February 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052
  ref 'Hoffmann_et_al_2020
    head = The present study provides evidence that host cell entry of SARSCoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming. Moreover, it suggests that antibody responses raised against SARS-CoV could at least partially protect against SARSCoV-2 infection.

    >>> Abstract
      The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2- S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.

  ref 'King_et_al_2020
    head =  By combining bulk antibody repertoire analysis with single-cell transcriptomics we have generated a detailed resource of the human GC response in a model secondary lymphoid tissue. This allowed us to define gene expression signatures of known and novel B cell states, most notably a population primed to undergo class switch recombination before entering the GC reaction. Whether a B cell undergoes class switch recombination at this stage then influences their capacity to undergo antibody-based selection within the GC and secondary activation as MBCs.

    >>> Abstract
      In response to antigen challenge, B cells clonally expand, undergo selection and differentiate to produce mature B cell subsets and high affinity antibodies. However, the interplay between dynamic B cell states and their antibody-based selection is challenging to decipher in primary human tissue. We have applied an integrated analysis of bulk and single-cell antibody repertoires paired with single-cell transcriptomics of human B cells undergoing affinity maturation. We define unique gene expression and antibody repertoires of known and novel B cell states, including a pre-germinal centre state primed to undergo class switch recombination. We dissect antibody class-dependent gene expression of germinal centre and memory B cells to find that class switching prior to germinal centre entry dictates the capacity of B cells to undergo antibody-based selection and differentiate. Together, our analyses provide unprecedented resolution into the gene expression and selection dynamics that shape B cell-mediated immunity.

    >>> Abstract
      The human conductive respiratory tract spans a long anatomical distance and represents an important barrier to constrain invading respiratory pathogens. The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33°C and 37°C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Abstract
      The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has spread rapidly on a global scale. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via human respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1–3. This study investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients’ toilet areas. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas was undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions showing peaks in submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions, but these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus.

      Objective: To characterize the clinical features of patients with severe COVID-19 in the UK.
      Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO.
      Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020.
      Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19.
      Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials.
      Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19%) and asthma (14%); 47% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49% of patients were discharged alive, 33% have died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20% were discharged alive, 53% died and 27% remained in hospital.
      Conclusions: We present the largest detailed description of COVID-19 in Europe, demonstrating the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus strain disease, has recently emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide. This novel strain is highly transmittable and severe disease has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. More than 600,000 cases have been confirmed and the number of deaths is constantly increasing. COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially those suffering from severe respiratory or systemic manifestations, fall under the spectrum of the acutely ill medical population, which is at increased venous thromboembolism risk. Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients infected with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients’ clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, we highlight the importance of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 infected patients and review relevant data of previous coronavirus epidemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

    head = COVID-19 is associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury and myocarditis, AMI, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and VTE. Some of the medications utilized to treat COVID-19 also have potential cardiac complications.

    >>> Background
      The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While systemic inflammation and pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.

    >>> Objective
      This brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

    >>> Discussion
      The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death. The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness. The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events. Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.

    >>> Conclusions
       Emergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with COVID-19.

  // Prevalence and Impact of Cardiovascular Metabolic Diseases on COVID-19 in China
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9
  ref 'Li_et_al_2020c
    head = Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.

    >>> Background
      Studies have reminded that cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities made patients more susceptible to suffer 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19), and exacerbated the infection. The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies.

    >>> Results
      A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients.

    >>> Conclusion
      Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.

    head = The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness.

    >>> Background
      CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

    >>> Purpose
      To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia

    >>> Materials and Methods
      During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change.

    >>> Results
      CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31/42 [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype.

    >>> Conclusion
      The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness.

  # UV Rays Mitigation
  // Inactivation of Model Viruses and Bacteria in Human Fresh Frozen Plasma Using Riboflavin and Long Wave Ultraviolet Rays
  doi: https://doi.org/xyz
  ref 'Elikaei_et_al_2006
    head = Results showed that the employed method (Riboflavin concentration and ultraviolet in three different energy doses) can inactivate most of the pathogens in fresh frozen plasma. The acceptable activities of selected plasma proteins remained after treatment.

    >>> Background and objectives
      Pathogen reduction technologies are among methods to eliminate transfusion transmitted infections. Mirasol method using riboflavin in combination with ultraviolet rays is one of them. The aims of this study were to investigate the effectiveness of Mirasol method to inactivate some model pathogens as well as examination of the sensitivity of plasma proteins after treatment.

    >>> Materials and methods
      Riboflavin in 50μM concentration and ultraviolet (365 nm) in three different energy doses (3.6, 7.2, and 10.8 j/cm2) were employed to inactivate model pathogens. Four standard viruses were used in this study including Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus1 (HSV-1), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) and Polio Virus. 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) and Reed-Muench Methods were used to estimate viruses' titers. E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus were used as bacterial models. Four plasma proteins including factor V, VIII, fibrinogen and antithromin were used to determine their sensitivity to pathogen inactivation treatment.

    >>> Results
      The most pathogen reduction titre was determined for 15 minutes irradiation period equal to 10.8 J/cm2 that is corresponding to Log 6.10 for BVDV, Log 6.09 for HSV-1, Log 6.62 for VSV and Log 3.36 for Polio. Bacterial reduction titer was Log 6.94 for E. coli and Log 7.00 for S. aureus. Indicator proteins for plasma activity were determined to be 75% for factor V, 88% for factor VIII, 52% for fibrinogen and 94% for antithrombin.

    >>> Conclusion
      Results showed that the employed method can inactivate most of the pathogens in fresh frozen plasma. The acceptable activities of selected plasma proteins remained after treatment.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w
  ref 'Welch_et_al_2018
    head = We have developed an approach to UV-based sterilization using single-wavelength far-UVC light generated by filtered excilamps, which selectively inactivate microorganisms, but does not produce biological damage to exposed mammalian cells and tissues

    >>> Abstract
      Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.

  # Clinical and virological data, epidemic, viral load, and suspecibility to infection, first cases in Europe, France, (check the author name)
  // Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30200-0
  ref 'XavierLescure_et_al_2020
    head = In this paper, we report clinical and virological data on the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe, with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. Although we acknowledge the fact that the results provided are based on a small number of cases, a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy enabled us to illustrate the different courses of the disease we observed, and provide some relevant criteria regarding the severity of disease. We believe that these findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

    >>> Background
      On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.

    >>> Methods
      In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.

    >>> Findings
      The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.

    >>> Interpretations
      We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

    let !a self assert = In this case series of five patients with COVID-19, we illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution: first, mild cases through two paucisymptomatic patients aged younger than 50 years who were diagnosed early, with high viral load in nasopharyngeal samples, suggesting a significant shedding of SARS-CoV-2, reflected by virus detection by RT-PCR; second, two young patients presenting with mild symptoms at admission and experiencing a secondary progression to pneumonia and severe disease by days 10–11; and third, an older patient with a rapid evolution towards critical disease with multiple organ failure and a long and sustained persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal detection associated with viral RNA detection in multiple sites, including blood.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !b self assert = Among the five cases investigated here, the two patients with mild disease were diagnosed at an early stage of the disease because they had a contact with a confirmed case. High viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are suggestive of potentially high risk of transmissibility during the very first days of symptoms. This finding is in line with data reported by Zou and colleagues, who analysed viral load in the upper respiratory tract in relation to day of onset of symptoms in 17 symptomatic patients in whom higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset. This observation suggests that the virus shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from that seen with SARS-CoV, in which the virus load was very low at disease onset

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !c self assert = In two of five patients reported here, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples. This possible route of transmission must be investigated; detection of viral RNA does not necessarily imply that infectious particles are present and transmissible,20 particularly when patients, such as these two individuals, have no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !d self assert = In this case series, three patients had a severe or critical disease with two different patterns. The first one, in patients with severe diseases (patients 1 and 2), is characterised by a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed with a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples: SARS-CoV-2 was no longer detected in the upper respiratory tract in one patient and at very low levels in the other. In patients with this pattern, a CT scan at the moment of the worsening showed ground-glass lung opacities, in line with those reported by others in patients with COVID-19. Time to worsening of respiratory symptoms was around 10 days after disease onset in these two cases, close to the median disease duration before worsening (8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !e self assert = In this case series, except for the patient with critical disease, the viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and day 14. Of note, the virus was also detected by rtRT-PCR at low levels in the upper respiratory tract, even after full resolution of symptoms. Whether infectious virus might be still present despite symptom resolution will require further attempts of virus isolation.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !f self assert = In these patients, one might postulate that the lung damage is more related to immunopathological lesions, resulting from an excessive pro-inflammatory host response, rather than to uncontrolled viral replication. Of note, we did not assess virus load in low respiratory tract samples from these two patients.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !g self assert = The second pattern, observed in the patient classified as having critical disease and who died (patient 3), consists of a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with positive virus detection by rtRT-PCR in other body fluids, including blood. By contrast with the previous pattern, this persistent high viral load suggests the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to evade the immune response.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !h self assert = Indeed, the 80-year-old patient, unlike the other cases, had evidence of high viral replication in the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract, with virus detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid. The impaired immune response might have facilitated the bacterial and fungal superinfections. Patient 3 was aged 80 years and might have had an impaired interferon pathway.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !i self assert = These different patterns, and especially the fact that patients with severe or critical disease might have different viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract, might be important.The findings suggest that different therapeutic approaches, based on viral kinetics monitoring, might be needed in patients with a virus load decrease in the upper respiratory tract versus those with high viral replication and systemic virus dissemination. We should be cautious when analysing these data because of the small number of patients, but adapting treatment to the clinical course should be considered in future studies.

    / March, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !j self assert = We considered remdesivir use in the three patients with severe disease patterns. On the basis of our data, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of remdesivir on COVID-19 infections. In two patients, the drug was initiated at the time of disease worsening, when the virus was already barely detectable in the clinical specimens. In one of them, remdesivir was discontinued after 5 days because of a combined alanine aminotransferase elevation and a rash, although it could not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to remdesivir. In the third patient, remdesivir was discontinued after a single dose because of renal replacement therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation. Remdesivir contains cyclodextrin, an excipient whose clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance. Because the patients condition was worsening and viral load was not decreasing, we reinitiated remdesivir.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9
  ref 'Lin_et_al_2003
    head = While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.

    >>> Background
      The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection.

    >>> Methods
      HLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190 normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis.

    >>> Results
      Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a "severe cases" patient group from the infected "probable SARS" patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc = 0.0279).

    >>> Conclusions
      Densely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.

On the contrary, the frequency of HLA-B* 4601 in the five severe cases was slightly increased when compared to the 28 excluded fever patients (P = 0.007, Pc = ns), but the difference was clearly significant when compared to control A (P = 0.0008, Pc = 0.03).

  // HLA Class I Alleles Are Associated with Peptide-Binding Repertoires of Different Size, Affinity, and Immunogenicity

  ref 'Paul_et_al_2013
    head = In this study, our data shows that different HLA class I alleles are associated with different peptide-binding repertoire sizes, defined as the fraction of all possible peptides that are bound at a given affinity threshold and sheds new light on the mechanisms governing allelic polymorphism of MHC molecules. We investigated the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. Although no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than are HLA A alleles. We predict that this enhanced understanding will further increase the accuracy and ease of prediction of MHC-restricted T cell epitopes.

    >>> Abstract
      Prediction of HLA binding affinity is widely used to identify candidate T cell epitopes, and an affinity of 500 nM is routinely used as a threshold for peptide selection. However, the fraction (percentage) of peptides predicted to bind with affinities of 500 nM varies by allele. For example, of a large collection of ∼30,000 dengue virus–derived peptides only 0.3% were predicted to bind HLA A*0101, wheras nearly 5% were predicted for A*0201. This striking difference could not be ascribed to variation in accuracy of the algorithms used, as predicted values closely correlated with affinity measured in vitro with purified HLA molecules. These data raised the question whether different alleles would also vary in terms of epitope repertoire size, defined as the number of associated epitopes or, alternatively, whether alleles vary drastically in terms of the affinity threshold associated with immunogenicity. To address this issue, strains of HLA transgenic mice with wide (A*0201), intermediate (B*0702), or narrow (A*0101) repertoires were immunized with peptides of varying binding affinity and relative percentile ranking. The results show that absolute binding capacity is a better predictor of immunogenicity, and analysis of epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database revealed that predictive efficacy is increased using allele-specific affinity thresholds. Finally, we investigated the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. Although no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than are HLA A alleles.

    let !a self assert = Our analysis demonstrates that the breadth of repertoire and associated epitope affinities is likely influenced by the structure of the HLA molecule, as differences are apparent between the HLA A and B loci.It is generally assumed that pathogen escape is a major driver of evolution of HLA polymorphism. In this regard, it is reasonable to hypothesize that repertoire size and average epitope affinity should be considered as broad variables potentially influencing HLA evolution at the immunogenetic and immunochemical level.

    let !b self assert = It is noteworthy that similar variation in repertoire size was recently noted in the case of the class I molecules expressed by the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) (55). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that similar allele-related variation in repertoire size will be broadly observed. Future studies will address this point by combined immunological and bioinformatics analyses.

    / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
    let !c self assert = A theoretical point of potential interest is whether the presence within a species or a population of different MHC allelic variants associated with different repertoire sizes might confer some advantage and be optimal in terms of overall biological function of the MHC system. A wide repertoire will render pathogen escape by loss of MHC binding less likely, but alternatively it might dilute the focus of the immune response, be more likely to trigger autoimmunity, or even paradoxically result in a too narrow T cell repertoire because of overzealous negative selection.

    / December, 2013 - The Journal of Immunology
    let !d self assert = Note, too, that in evolutionary terms, HLA B polymorphism is more recent, more diverse, and more rapidly evolving. Thus, in a broad sense, HLA A seems, on average, to be associated with a broader repertoire approach than does HLA B, which seems to be enacting a strategy based on somewhat narrower but more flexible and diverse repertoires and binding motifs. Indeed, most examples of HLA class I molecules associated with disease resistance to viral infections, such as HIV or DENV, are HLA B.

    >>> Summary
      Following their discovery in the early 1970s, classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been the prototypical candidates for genetic susceptibility to infectious disease. Indeed, the original hypothesis for the extreme variability observed at HLA loci (H-2 in mice) was the major selective pressure from infectious diseases. Now that both the human genome and the molecular basis of innate and acquired immunity are understood in greater detail, do the classical HLA loci still stand out as major genes that determine susceptibility to infectious disease? This review looks afresh at the evidence supporting a role for classical HLA loci in susceptibility to infectious disease, examines the limitations of data reported to date, and discusses current advances in methodology and technology that will potentially lead to greater understanding of their role in infectious diseases in the future.

  ref 'Nguyen_et_al_2020
    head = We found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS. Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic. Based on our study, we think variation in HLA genes is part of the explanation for the huge differences in infection severity in many COVID-19 patients. These differences in the HLA genes are probably not the only genetic factor that affects severity of COVID-19, but they may be a significant piece of the puzzle.

    >>> Abstract
      Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [lsqb]HLA[rsqb] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (Lin M, Tseng H-K, Trejaut JA, Lee H-L, Loo J-H, Chu C-C, Chen P-J, Su Y-W, Lim KH, Tsai Z-U, Lin R-Y, Lin R-S, Huang C-H. BMC Med Genet 4:9. 2003.). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.

    >>> Importance
      Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of viral severity in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.

  ref 'Asadi_et_al_2019
    head = This paper shows that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as “speech superemitters,” consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.

    >>> Abstract
      Mechanistic hypotheses about airborne infectious disease transmission have traditionally emphasized the role of coughing and sneezing, which are dramatic expiratory events that yield both easily visible droplets and large quantities of particles too small to see by eye. Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic).

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021725
  ref 'Dufresne_et_al_2020
    head = This paper reiterates that when accounting for the full distribution of secondary cases caused by an infected individual, there is no direct relationship between R0 and the size of an outbreak. We also stress that both R0 and the full secondary case distribution are not properties of the disease itself, but are instead set by properties of the pathogen, the host population and the context of the outbreak. Nevertheless, we provide a straightforward methodology for translating estimates of transmission heterogeneity into epidemic forecasts. Altogether, predicting outbreak size based on early data is an incredibly complex challenge but one that is increasingly within reach due to new mathematical analyses and faster communication of public health data.

    >>> Abstract
      The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory (Newman2001) that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. %, in the case of COVID-19 from 10-70\% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.

Instead, they only need to be run over enough early data to infer the parameter estimates that are then fed into our network model to compute the final outbreak size.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !h self assert = As for COVID-19, how the width of the confidence interval on our prediction for the final outbreak size mostly stems from uncertainty in the heterogeneity of secondary infections; i.e., the dispersion parameter k. With limited heterogeneity, our predictions would have been closer to classic mass-action forecasts and the current pandemic of COVID-19 would likely have been a consequence of not only R0, but of the homogeneity of secondary infections: each new cases steadily leading to additional infections. Thankfully, with recent large estimates for its heterogeneity, the observed transmission could be mostly maintained by so-called “super-spreading events”, which could be easier to manage with contact tracing, screening and infection control.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00796-17
  ref 'Langwig_et_al_2017
    head = Our data emphasize the importance of incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility in estimates of control measure efficacy. Inclusion of this variance will help to improve prediction and allow for better management of infectious diseases of humans and wildlife.

    >>> Abstract
      Heterogeneity in host susceptibility is a key determinant of infectious disease dynamics but is rarely accounted for in assessment of disease control measures. Understanding how susceptibility is distributed in populations, and how control measures change this distribution, is integral to predicting the course of epidemics with and without interventions. Using multiple experimental and modeling approaches, we show that rainbow trout have relatively homogeneous susceptibility to infection with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus and that vaccination increases heterogeneity in susceptibility in a nearly all-or-nothing fashion. In a simple transmission model with an R0 of 2, the highly heterogeneous vaccine protection would cause a 35 percentage-point reduction in outbreak size over an intervention inducing homogenous protection at the same mean level. More broadly, these findings provide validation of methodology that can help to reduce biases in predictions of vaccine impact in natural settings and provide insight into how vaccination shapes population susceptibility.

    >>> Importance
      Differences among individuals influence transmission and spread of infectious diseases as well as the effectiveness of control measures. Control measures, such as vaccines, may provide leaky protection, protecting all hosts to an identical degree, or all-or-nothing protection, protecting some hosts completely while leaving others completely unprotected. This distinction can have a dramatic influence on disease dynamics, yet this distribution of protection is frequently unaccounted for in epidemiological models and estimates of vaccine efficacy. Here, we apply new methodology to experimentally examine host heterogeneity in susceptibility and mode of vaccine action as distinct components influencing disease outcome. Through multiple experiments and new modeling approaches, we show that the distribution of vaccine effects can be robustly estimated. These results offer new experimental and inferential methodology that can improve predictions of vaccine effectiveness and have broad applicability to human, wildlife, and ecosystem health.

    / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
    let !b self assert = Heterogeneity in infectiousness can modify disease dynamics, but importantly must be correlated with susceptibility, contacts, or other parameters (e.g., mortality from disease) to influence the size of epidemics. This is because the mean of the distribution will be identical among infected cohorts unless other model parameters preferentially remove or add individuals that change this mean (e.g., individuals that are more infectious die before they transmit).

    / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
    let !c self assert = Conversely, like heterogeneity in susceptibility, heterogeneity in contacts will change dynamically over an epidemic as the individuals with the highest numbers of contacts become infected early in the epidemic and continue to infect others during their infectious period but then exit the infected pool as they recover (for pathogens with a recovered class). Therefore, adding heterogeneity in the encounter rate should further reduce the size of outbreaks, dependent on correlations between model parameters and the relative importance of each host trait in determining infection and mortality.

    / November, 2017 - American Society for Microbiology
    let !d self assert = Excluding heterogeneity in susceptibility from epidemic models had a significant impact on disease dynamics. Using a polarized mode of vaccine action resulted in fewer infected individuals under a wide range of R0 values, whereas homogeneous protection led to all hosts becoming infected for R0 values of 6. While the fraction of hosts infected will depend on particular parameter estimates, and we have not exhausted all parameter combinations and shape possibilities, this study provides further evidence that heterogeneous susceptibility decreases the size of epidemics. This is because the polarized mode of vaccine action greatly reduced the susceptibility of a fraction of individuals, nearly completely protecting them against infection.

Conversely, the homogeneous model assumed that the susceptibility of all individuals was identical and therefore did not allow for the effect of cohort selection.The discrete all-or-nothing model overestimated vaccine protection compared to the experimentally derived distribution of vaccine protection.

  ref 'Ferrari_et_al_2006
    head = The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.

    >>> Abstract
      The spread of infectious disease through communities depends fundamentally on the underlying patterns of contacts between individuals. Generally, the more contacts one individual has, the more vulnerable they are to infection during an epidemic. Thus, outbreaks disproportionately impact the most highly connected demographics. Epidemics can then lead, through immunization or removal of individuals, to sparser networks that are more resistant to future transmission of a given disease. Using several classes of contact networks—Poisson, scale-free and small-world—we characterize the structural evolution of a network due to an epidemic in terms of frailty (the degree to which highly connected individuals are more vulnerable to infection) and interference (the extent to which the epidemic cuts off connectivity among the susceptible population that remains following an epidemic). The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.

By using 2 distinct approaches, we estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak in Wuhan to be 0.21–0.30 per day (a doubling time of 2.3–3.3 days), suggesting a much faster rate of spread than initially measured.

    >>> Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2–2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period. We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

  // The disease-induced herd immunity level for Covid-19 is substantially lower than the classical herd immunity level
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.20093336
  ref 'Britton_et_al_2020
    head = The present study highlights that the disease-induced herd immunity level may be substantially lower then the classical herd immunity level. Our illustration indicates a reduction from 60% down to 43% (assuming R0 = 2.5) but this should be interpreted as an illustration, rather than an exact value or even a best estimate.

    >>> Abstract
      Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level hC is defined as hC=1-1/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level hD, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than hC. As an illustration we show that if R0=2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is hD=43% rather than hC=1-1/2.5=60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

    let !c self assert = As illustrated in our results section, differences in social activity plays a greater role in reducing the disease-induced herd immunity level than inhomogeneous agegroup mixing. Thus models not having such features will see smaller difference between hD and hC.Our choice to have 50% having average activity, 25% having half and 25% having double activity is of course very arbitrary. An important future task is hence to determine how size of differences in social activity within age groups. The more social heterogeneity there is between groups, the bigger difference between hD and hC.

For example, most countries have a pronounced ambition to protect elderly (and other risk groups), which does not obey this assumption.

Note that also the yellow curve, having overall fraction infected well below the classical herd immunity level hC = 60% is protected by herd immunity since no second wave appears. This clearly illustrates that the disease-induced herd immunity level hC is well below 60% – it is 43%

    let !g self assert = There are of course other more efficient exit-strategies than to lift all restrictions simultaneously. In fact, most countries are currently employing a gradual lifting of preventive measures. Such slower lifting of preventive measures will avoid seeing the type of overshoot illustrated by the purple curve, which results in a greater fraction infected than the yellow curve, even though the latter has milder restrictions. The effect of such gradual lifting of restrictions will result in the final fraction infected reaching close to the disease-induced herd immunity level

    / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !h self assert = The current model took age cohorts and social activity levels into account. However, more complex and realistic models have many other types of heterogeneities: for instance increased spreading within households (of different sizes) or within schools and workplaces; and spatial aspects with rural areas having lower contact rates than metropolitan regions.It seems reasonable to assume that most such additional heterogeneities will have the effect of lowering the disease-induced immunity level hDS even further, in that high spreading environments (metropolitan regions, large households, big workplaces, ...) will have a higher fraction infected thus resulting in immunity being concentrated even more on highly active individuals. Some complex models do not categorize individuals into different activity levels, or the related feature in an underlying social network with varying numberof acquaintances.

  // Individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 lowers the herd immunity threshold
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081893
  ref 'Gomes_et_al_2020
    head = This paper demonstrates that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure (connectivity) accelerates the acquisition of immunity in populations. More susceptible and more connected individuals have a higher propensity to be infected and thus are likely to become immune earlier. Due to this selective immunisation, heterogeneous populations require less infections to cross their herd immunity thresholds than homogeneous (or not sufficiently heterogeneous) models would suggest. We integrate continuous distributions of susceptibility or connectivity in otherwise basic epidemic models for COVID-19 and show that as the coefficient of variation increases from 0 to 4, the herd immunity threshold declines from over 60% to less than 10%. Measures of individual variation are urgently needed to narrow the estimated ranges of herd immunity thresholds and plan accordingly.

    >>> Abstract
      As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the incidence of new cases to decline. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

Selection results in the removal of the most at-risk individuals from the susceptible pool as they become infected and eventually recover (some die). This selective acquisition of infection and immunity results simultaneously in decelerated epidemic growth and accelerated induction of immunity in the population.

    let !b self assert = In idealised scenarios of vaccines delivered at random and individuals mixing at random, herd immunity thresholds are given by a simple formula (1 − 1⁄R0!) which, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, suggests that 60-70% of the population should be immunised to halt spread considering estimates of R0! between 2.5 and 3. A crucial caveat in exporting these calculations to immunization by natural infection, is that natural infection does not occur at random.

Most CV estimates are comprised between 2 and 4, a range where naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may place populations over the herd immunity threshold once as few as 10-20% of its individuals are immune. This depends, however, on which specific transmission traits are variable.

    / May, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !e self assert = Heterogeneity in the transmission of respiratory infections has traditionally focused on variation in exposure summarised into age-structured contact matrices. Besides overlooking differences in susceptibility given exposure, the aggregation of individuals into age groups curtails coefficients of variation with important downstream implications. Popular models based on contact matrices use a coefficient of variation around 0.9 and perform similarly to our scenarios for CV = 1. Supported by existing estimates across infectious diseases, we argue that CV is generally higher and prognostics more optimistic than currently assumed. However plausible, this needs to be confirmed for the current COVID-19 pandemic and, given its relevance to policy decisions, it should be set as a priority

    let !f self assert = Variation in infectiousness was critical to attribute the scarce and explosive outbreaks to superspreaders when the SARS-CoV-1 emerged in 2002, but infectiousness does not respond to selection as susceptibility or exposure do. Models with or without individual variation in infectiousness perform equivalently when implemented deterministically and only differ due to stochasticity in an entirely different phenomenon to that presented in this paper. Among the estimates of individual variation plotted in Figure 3, those corresponding to SARS-CoV viruses have been described as variation in individual infectiousness, but the way authors describe superspreaders is suggestive that higher infectiousness stems from higher connectivity with other individuals, who may be susceptible displayed in Figure 2, with CV = 3 for exposure to infection.

    let !g self assert = Interventions themselves have potential to manipulate individual variation.Current social distancing measures may be argued to either increase or decrease variation in exposure, depending on the compliance of highly-susceptible or highly-connected individuals in relation to the average.

    let !i self assert = On the one hand, if CV is very low, the most stringent control measures would need to be continued for suppression of the epidemic. The other side of that coin is a scenario where keeping only the mildest control measures (protecting the elderly to reduce mortality rates) is optimal. It would therefore be imperative to conduct longitudinal serological studies in representative samples of the population, as control measures are relaxed. Given a percent positivity in an initial survey, the speed at which that figure increases after control measures are eased would reveal what the most likely value of CV is, and simultaneously advise which control measures should be enforced.

    >>> Abstract
      Background: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.

Both criteria predict that there is little residual risk of infectivity, based on cell culture.

    / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !l self assert = The serological courses of all patients suggest a timing of seroconversion similar to or slightly earlier than in SARS-CoV infection. Seroconversion in most cases of SARS occurred during the second week of symptoms. As in SARS and MERS, IgM was not detected significantly earlier than IgG in immunofluorescence, which might in part be due to technical reasons as the higher avidity of IgG antibodies outcompetes IgM for viral epitopes in the assay. IgG depletion can only partially alleviate this effect.

    / March, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !m self assert = When aligned to viral load courses, it seems there is no abrupt virus elimination at the time of seroconversion. Rather, seroconversion early in week 2 coincides with a slow but steady decline of sputum viral load. Whether certain properties such as glycosylation pattern at critical sites of the glycoprotein play a role in the attenuation of neutralizing antibody response needs further clarification. In any case, vaccine approaches targeting mainly the induction of antibody responses should aim to induce particularly strong antibody responses in order to be effective.

  // Nasal irrigation: From empiricism to evidence-based medicine. A review

  ref 'Bastier_et_al_2015
    head = Large-volume irrigation provides good distribution over the sinonasal cavities as a whole; and a stable, reproducible isotonic solution with slightly alkaline pH and a composition close to that of seawater optimizes trophic and functional recovery of the respiratory epithelium.

    >>> Abstract
      Nasal irrigation plays a non-negligible role in the treatment of numerous sinonasal pathologies and postoperative care. There is, however, a wide variety of protocols. The present review of the evidence-based literature sought objective arguments for optimization and efficacy. It emerged that large-volume low-pressure nasal douche optimizes the distribution and cleansing power of the irrigation solution in the nasal cavity. Ionic composition and pH also influence mucociliary clearance and epithelium trophicity. Seawater is less rich in sodium ions and richer in bicarbonates, potassium, calcium and magnesium than is isotonic normal saline, while alkaline pH and elevated calcium concentration optimized ciliary motility in vitro. Bicarbonates reduce secretion viscosity. Potassium and magnesium promote healing and limit local inflammation. These results show that the efficacy of nasal irrigation is multifactorial. Large-volume low-pressure nasal irrigation using undiluted seawater seems, in the present state of knowledge, to be the most effective protocol.

    let !a self assert = The greater the irrigation volume, the larger the cavity area covered by the irrigation: large-volume irrigation reaches a larger proportion of the nasal cavities. Depending on volume and device, application time ranged between 6 and 54 s, and output between 3.9 and 27.2 mL/s.Only compression systems delivering ≥120 mbar pressure reached the entire nasal cavity.

    let !b self assert = In vitro, solutions with pH <7 or >10 reduced tracheal mucosa ciliary beat frequency in rats and chicken embryos. In humans, solutions with acidic pH likewise reduced ciliary beat frequency, while slightly alkaline solutions enhanced it. In vivo, on the other hand, in humans, pH impact on mucociliary clearance is more difficult to ascertain. England et al. found no statistical correlation between pH and mucociliary clearance in healthy non-smokers

    / November, 2015 - European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases
    let !d self assert = However, change in mucociliary clearance seems not to depend exclusively on pH: in vitro, in chicken embryo tracheal explants, hypertonic (1.5%) and hypotonic (0.45%) irrigation both reduced ciliary beat frequency as compared to physiological (0.9%) saline. Beat arrest was irreversible with a 14% solution, and hypertonicity triggered mucus hypersecretion and increased the permeability of tight junctions. These data correlated in vivo with increased secretion and exudation in response to hypertonic solutions. Paradoxically, other authors reported improved in vivo mucociliary clearance on saccharine test in healthy subjects with hypertonic solutions between 3% and 5%.

In a more recent in vitro study, 2 to 4 hours’ exposure to electrodialyzed seawater enhanced viability in deprived bronchial epithelial cells as compared to isotonic normal saline.

The same author, using the same methodology, more recently reported a similar improvement in symptoms in 114 patients with irrigation with hypertonic Dead Sea water without corticotherapy versus hypertonic saline with local corticosteroids.

The first, a controlled multicenter study of 390 children with rhinitis, found faster improvement in nasal permeability and the quality and quantity of secretion with electrodialyzed seawater irrigation than in a control group without irrigation . It also demonstrated that irrigation reduced number of episodes, ENT complications and medication (antipyretics, antibiotics, mucolytics and decongestants) in children suffering from frequent rhinitis. The second, single-center, study of 69 children with acute sinusitis, found that standard treatment (antibiotics, mucolytics and local nasal decongestants) reduced symptoms more effectively when associated to nasal irrigation with an isotonic solution. Both studies showed the efficacy of irrigation in these respective pathologies, but did not demonstrate the superiority of either solution, as there was no comparative arm.

    let !k self assert = In postoperative use, nasal irrigation is essential for cleansing the crusts and secretions inherent to any sinonasal surgery. It significantly reduces nasal secretion and shows a tendency to reduce postsurgical edema. Ringer's lactate, which is rich in calcium and potassium and less rich in sodium and chloride ions than isotonic saline, provided a stronger increase in mucociliary transport than isotonic saline after endonasal surgery.

Pigret and Jankowski found no significant difference between the effects of pressurized seawater and saline with antiseptics and mucolytics. Keerl et al., in an observational study of 121 patients, found nasal irrigation to be well tolerated, and that some patients continued in the long-term, including irrigation in their daily life routine. Pinto et al. found no symptomatic benefit of irrigation, whether iso- or hypertonic, and recommended not implementing postoperative irrigation; their study, however involved certain defects: no inclusion criteria, and no details of surgical technique, numerous revision surgeries and application of an endonasal hemostasis substance. Moreover, the symptoms scores used were not validated, and final nasal cavity status was not noted.

Within 72 hours, 72 per cent of the passengers became III with symptoms of cough, fever, fatigue, headache, sore throat and myalgia. One passenger, the apparent Index case, was III on the airplane, and the clinical attack rate among the others varied with the amount of time spent aboard. Virus antigenlcally similar to A/Texas/1/77 (H3N2) was Isolated from 8 of 31 passengers cultured, and 20 of 22 ill persons tested had serologlc evidence of infection with this virus. The airplane ventilation system was inoperative during the delay and this may account for the high attack rate.

During normal operation, the airplane ventilation system was designed to completely exchange the air in the passenger compartment, a volume of 3 m3, every four and one-half minutes. The airflow from ceiling to floor was laminar, with little fore-to-aft turbulence between rows. However, following engine failure, the ventilation system was turned off and the doors were kept closed for approximately two hours. Later, when the front cargo and rear passenger compartment doors were opened, most passengers felt that the compartment was comfortable or warm although the outside temperature was 1.7 C (29 F), suggesting that there was poor air exchange even during this period.

Moreover, this attack rate varied by groups of persons on board; e.g. crew, 40 per cent; Anchorage boarding passengers, 58 per cent; and Homer boarding passengers, 83 per cent. Among these groups, those with higher attack rates were again the persons who had been on the airplane longer. The high clinical attack rate among passengers aboard the aircraft was probably the result of their exposure to large aerosols of droplets produced by an ill passenger in a confined, stagnant and dry airspace. Proper operation of the air circulation equipment and isolation of the ill passenger might have prevented spread of theinfluenza virus.

  # SARS, Aircraft transmission,
  // Transmission of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on Aircraft
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa031349
  ref 'Olsen_et_al_2003
    head = Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

    >>> Background
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.

    >>> Methods
      We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.

    >>> Results
      After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

    >>> Conclusions
      Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

A total of five persons died as a result of their illness (three persons from Hong Kong, one from China, and one from Singapore).

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !b self assert = The risk of illness was related to the proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 passegers who were seated in the same row as the patient or in the three rows in front of him, as compared with 10 of the 88 passengers who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). It is notable that 56 percent of the passengers who became infected were not seated in the same row as the index patient or in the three rows in front of him.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !c self assert = The observation that the passengers who became infected were clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft, is consistent with the pattern described in other cases in which a respiratory pathogen was transmitted on board an aircraft and lends further plausibility to the theory that transmission occurred during the flight.

    let !d self assert = The distance covered by three economy-class rows on a Boeing 737-300 is 2.3 m (90 in.). On this aircraft, 90 percent of the persons who became ill were seated more than 36 in. away from the index patient, so airborne, small-particle, or other remote transmission may be more straightforward explanations for the observed distribution of cases.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !e self assert = There was no significant difference in risk between persons seated in an aisle seat and those seated in a middle or window seat (6 of 39 [15 percent] vs. 12 of 72 [17 percent]; relative risk, 0.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 2.3). Hand contact might have been expected to increase the risk among passengers who sat in aisle seats, but we did not find such a pattern. Two of the 20 passengers who became infected (and whose seating assignments are known) were seated within 0.9 m (36 in.) of the index patient.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !f self assert = As was expected on the basis of the known patterns of transmission of SARS, the fact that the virus appeared to be transmitted by passengers who were in the symptomatic phase of illness but not by those who were in the presymptomatic phase suggests that the risk of transmission varies according to the phase of illness. It is likely that persons who fly during the incubation period (within 10 days before the onset of illness) pose very little or no risk to other passengers. However, we might have missed some cases because of the low percentage of passengers from Flight 1 who were contacted and because of the limitations in routine surveillance.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !g self assert = As in our findings with regard to Flights 2 and 3, the risk of transmission can vary widely. The variation in risk might be influenced by the duration of the flight, the stage of illness, the type of air-ventilation system in use, the size of the aircraft, and the number of infected persons on board. In addition, some investigators have proposed that poorly characterized host factors in certain patients predispose them to transmit the virus to large numbers of persons (making them so-called “super-spreaders”), a hypothesis that has been used to explain epidemiologic clustering in Hong Kong and Singapore and that might be applicable to the index patient on Flight 2

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !h self assert = It is important to emphasize that the true attack rate on Flight 2 may be different from the rate we calculated. Sixteen of the 22 cases that resulted from this flight had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV. No specimens were available for testing from five patients, and one patient had a negative test; some patients who were deemed to have probable cases of SARS may not have been infected with SARS-CoV.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !i self assert = On the other hand, five of the cases resulted in death, and the other patients had illness compatible with a diagnosis of SARS whose onset occurred within the expected incubation period. Forty-six of the passengers who were considered not to have been infected were not interviewed, including the two who sat next to the index patient, and it is possible that routine surveillance missed some additional infections.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !j self assert = The fact that only 45 percent of the passengers were interviewed despite intensive investigation by three health departments over the course of two months highlights the difficulties faced by such investigations and raises the possibility that more transmission occurred than was recognized.

    / December, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !k self assert = In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

    head = Although sneezing probably accounts for a certain number of sporadic cases of hemolytic streptococcal infection, it is not, in our opinion, important in epidemics because it is not a common symptom and very few sneezes discharge significant numbers of beta hemolytic streptococci into the air as droplet nuclei. The rare carriers whose sneezes heavily contaminate the air may be very dangerous if they do not baffle the sneezes efficiently. Since the material atomized in a sneeze is saliva, these individuals represent a type of dangerous carrier whose nose culture may be negative.  whose nose culture may be negative. Coughing, likewise, is important only in sporadic infections for similar reasons. This symptom is more common than sneezing. Talking expels negligible numbers of hemolytic streptococci.

In the most common, moderate numbers were expelled in large droplets which fell rapidly to the floor 1.5 feet from the sneezer, but very few or none in droplet nuclei. In one of two less common patterns, small numbers of beta streptococci were sneezed as droplet nuclei but none in large droplets; in the other, no beta streptococci were recovered from the air. In the rarest, of which only one example was found, large numbers of beta (and alpha) streptococci were expelled both as droplet nuclei and in large droplets; many were collected as far as 9.5 feet from the sneezer. The saliva of this carrier contained huge numbers of beta streptococci. Thirty-five per cent of twenty carriers sneezed out large numbers of alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei. Eighty per cent discharged moderate or large numbers in heavy droplets which fell rapidly to the floor.

    let !d self assert = In the most common pattern (65 per cent of the subjects) few or no beta streptococci were discharged as droplet nuclei, but many were expelled in large droplets captured by the settling plate on the floor 1 1/2 feet from the subject. Fewer than 10 per cent of these large droplets traveled as far as 5 1/2 feet. In a less common pattern, 10 per cent of the subjects, small numbers of droplet nuclei contained beta streptococci but none were collected in large droplets failing on the settling plates. In 20 per cent of the subjects, few or no beta streptococci were recovered at all.

    let !e self assert = Only one carrier, No. 20, sneezed large numbers of beta streptococci (and also alpha streptococci), both as droplet nuclei and in large droplets falling on all three settling plates. That this subject was really an unusually good atomizer was shown by a second test performed six days after the first. In these two tests he expelled an average of nine beta streptococci per cubic foot per sneeze as droplet nuclei fairly evenly distributed among the three bubblers. In the third experiment the following week his between the sneeze patterns of alpha and output diminished.

The numbers of these non-pathogens recovered from the air are presented in  was common, occurring in 35 per cent ofthe subjects. Most of the remaining 65 per cent expelled few or no alphas as dropletnuclei but significant numbers in large droplets. Thus the common and rare patterns but not the less common patternsof beta streptococcus expulsion were reproduced by alpha streptococci.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !g self assert = Of even greater importance is the relative number of bacteria expelled in tiny droplet nuclei as compared with rapidly falling droplets. The fact that 35 per cent of the carriers in this series sneezed large numbersof alpha (salivary) streptococci as droplet nuclei indicates that expulsion of these tiny nuclei by sneezing is a frequent occurrence.

Nearly as many droplet nuclei were recovered 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 feet from the sneezer as 1 1/2 feet away.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !i self assert = Persistence of Alpha and Beta Streptococci in air after Sneezing. First, approximately 50 per cent of the number of streptococci collected during sneezing still remained suspended in the air ten to sixteen minutes. Air cultures made in one experiment thirty minutes after the first sneeze, revealed only 5 per cent left. Our findings are in general agreement with those of Bourdillon, Lidwell and Lovelock, who noted that of the total number of air-borne bacteria recovered during the first minute after sneezing, 32 per cent were present fifteen minutes later.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !j self assert = The second point of interest is the sharp change in the distribution of the streptococci on the three settling plates ten to sixteen minutes after sneezing as compared with the sneezing period. During sneezing, about ten times as many streptococci were collected in the nearest settling plate as in either of the other two whereas the three plates exposed ten to sixteen minutes after sneezing recovered approximately equal numbers. This means that the plates in the postsneezing period probably collected particles of the same order of size as did the bubblers during sneezing. Once the rapidly falling droplets had left the air, settling plates collected small droplets or droplet nuclei which had become evenly dispersed throughout the room and settled slowly to the floor.

    let !k self assert = In the case of most carriers the greatest proportion of the streptococci expelled in saliva during sneezing fall rapidly to the ground and hence do not contaminate the air until they are resuspended as dust. Sneezing, moreover, contributes relatively little to the bacterial reservoirs in dust, bed clothing and elsewhere in the environment because it is not a common symptom in carriers.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !l self assert = In the present study of twenty carriers, only one discharged large numbers of these bacteria as tiny droplet nuclei during violent unbaffled sneezing although of course a carrier such as this one represents a real hazard. He possessed the two important requisites for the expulsion of large numbers of hemolytic streptococcus-containing droplet nuclei during sneezing: an unusually high contamination of the saliva (7,000,OOO per cc.) and a mechanically efficient atomizing capacity.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !m self assert = Since the concentration of alpha (salivary) streptococci per cc. of saliva is remarkably constant from one individual to another, the number of these microorganisms recovered from the air in large droplets or drdplet nuclei during sneezing provides a gobd index of the quality of sneezes.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !n self assert = Coughing does not ordinarily discharge saliva. A cough, because it originates in the back of the throat, disperses the secretions of the pharynx, the secretions of the nose if they have dripped back into the throat or material from below the larynx. This is confirmed bacteriologically by the absence of salivary streptococci from the air into which carriers coughed. The explanation of the failure of 95 per cent of carriers to expel beta streptococci by coughing, even though they were present in large numbers in the throat, is probably that the act of coughing, even volleys of twelve violent coughs, does not ordinarily shear off enough fluid from the mucous membranes of the posterior pharynx to carry significant numbers of these organisms.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !o self assert = One carrier, No. 21, expelled very large numbers, averaging 4 per cubic foot per cough, or 45 per cubic foot during the volley of twelve coughs. Quite large numbers were recovered by both bubblers and plates 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 feet from the cougher. Interestingly enough the air contained no alpha streptococci, indicating that the fluid coughed was not saliva but rather material the other hand, his saliva contained only 38,000 per cc. Further evidence that the saliva is not ordinarily the fluid which comprises cough droplets was the absence of alpha streptococci in the air in nearlyall the other cough tests.

    / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
    let !p self assert = Previous studies have shown that carriers exhibiting positive nose cultures for hemolytic streptococci were more likely to transmit infection than those with positive throat but negative nose cultures. Throat carriers whose nose cultures were negative were also occasionally found to be responsible for secondary cases of streptococcal infection. Carrier No. 20 of this present series, who sneezed very large numbers of hemolytic streptococci, exhibited negative nose cultures at the time of the test although the nose cultures had been positive a few days before. As mentioned in the text his saliva contained an unusually highconcentration of hemolytic streptococci.Such individuals, as well as some of thosedescribed in the earlier investigation of coughing and sneezing,’represent throat carriers who are not innoccuous.

   / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
   let !q self assert = Talking- Almost no beta (or alpha) streptococci were expelled during talking. ‘No bubbler sample collected as many as one streptococcus per cubic foot, and twenty-nine of the thirty samplers in tests of ten carriers captured none at all. The settling plates likewise were practically free of streptococci, only three of thirty plates exhibiting one colony each.

   / May, 1948 - The American Journal of Medicine
   let !r self assert = A more precise understanding of the ro1e of sneezing in the transmission of different respiratory diseases may result from a study of the concentration of the infective agent in the saliva and of thefrequency of sneezing among carriers of the agent.

  ref 'Jefferson_et_al_2008
    head = In this systematic review we found that physical barriers such as handwashing, wearing a mask, and isolation of potentially infected patients were effective in preventing the spread of respiratory virus infections.

    >>> Objective
      To systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

    >>> Data Extraction
      Search strategy of the Cochrane Library, Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, without language restriction, for any intervention to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hygiene). Study designs were randomised trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and controlled before and after studies.

    >>> Data Synthesis
      Of 2300 titles scanned 138 full papers were retrieved, including 49 papers of 51 studies. Study quality was poor for the three randomised controlled trials and most of the cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of most data except that from six case-control studies. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggest that the spread of respiratory viruses into the community can be prevented by intervening with hygienic measures aimed at younger children. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggests that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52); wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03); wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06); wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41); wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12); and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease the spread of respiratory disease remains uncertain. The lack of proper evaluation of global measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing prevent firm conclusions being drawn.

    >>> Conclusion
      Routine long term implementation of some physical measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult but many simple and low cost interventions could be useful in reducing the spread.

    let !a self assert = The most impressive effects came from high quality cluster randomised trials in preventing the spread of respiratory virus into the community using hygienic measures aimed at younger children. One study reported a significant decrease in respiratory illness in children up to age 24 months (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.97), although the decrease was not significant in older children (0.95, 0.89 to 1.01).w11 Another study reported a 50% (95% confidence interval 65% to 34%) lower incidence of pneumonia in children aged less than 5 years in a developing country. Additional benefit from reduced transmission to other household members is broadly supported by the results of other study designs although the potential for confounding is greater.

    head =  The implementation of this simple handwashing program in a Navy training camp was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of outpatient respiratory illness that was sustained over a 2-year period. Despite its success, maintenance of the handwashing program has been challenging in the time-constrained setting of military training.

    >>> Objectives
      In response to increasing concerns about respiratory illness in military recruits, a simple handwashing program was developed and evaluated at a large Navy training center.

    >>> Methods
      Clinical records from 1996 through 1998 were reviewed to determine weekly rates of respiratory illness before and after program implementation (1,089,800 person-weeks reviewed). A supplemental survey was given to a sample of recruits to assess self-reported respiratory illness and compliance with the handwashing program.

    >>> Results
      A 45% reduction in total outpatient visits for respiratory illness was observed after implementation of the handwashing program. No change was noted in hospitalization rates for respiratory illness, which remained low during the observation period. Survey data supported clinical observations, as frequent handwashers self-reported fewer respiratory illness episodes when compared to infrequent handwashers. Surveys also revealed challenges with handwashing compliance.

    >>> Conclusions
      Implementation of a handwashing program in this population of healthy young adults was associated with a marked reduction in outpatient visits for respiratory illness. Despite its success, maintenance of the handwashing program has been challenging in the time-constrained setting of military training.

  ref 'Gudbjartsson_et_al_2020
    head = In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

    >>> Background
      During the current worldwide pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was first diagnosed in Iceland at the end of February. However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population.

    >>> Methods
      We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples.

    >>> Results
      As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.

    >>> Conclusions
      In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

Through population screening, positive results were reported for 100 of 13,080 participants (0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.0); positive test results were reported for 87 of 10,797 persons (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.0) who accepted the open invitation for testing and 13 of 2283 persons (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9) who were invited at random. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. These results were consistent with a slow spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the Icelandic population.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !b self assert = The lack of increase in the incidence of infection over time may be due to containment efforts by the Icelandic health care authorities and their nimble response to the outbreak abroad. Testing of exposed persons with symptoms had been carried out for 1 month before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was identified in Iceland. Self-isolation, quarantining, and other social-distancing measures may also have helped to prevent an increase in the infection rate.

    let !c self assert = Of the participants who tested positive from the early targeted-testing phase and who had traveled, 86.1% had visited areas designated as being at high risk by the end of February (China and the Alps mountain regions in Austria, Italy, and Switzerland), whereas only 1 of the participants with a positive test identified through population screening had traveled to a high-risk area. On the other hand, 12 of 87 participants (13.8%) with positive tests in the screening group had recently traveled to the United Kingdom, as compared with 1.8% of those who tested negative, which suggests relatively early spread of the virus in the U.K. population.

However, only 6.9% of the participants in the population-screening group reported having had contact with an infected person, probably because infected persons and their contacts were in isolation and therefore not eligible for the population screening.

    let !f self assert = Among the participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms of Covid-19 were reported by 93% of those in the overall targeted-testing group and by 57% of those in the overall population-screening group. However, 29% of participants who tested negative in the overall population-screening group also reported having symptoms. Reports of symptoms became less common among participants in the population screening during the study period (despite the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate), probably owing to a general decrease in other respiratory infections, which in turn may have been brought about through measures implemented to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

    let !j self assert = Several viral lineages have emerged during the 3 to 4 months since the original outbreak in China, with an average of five mutations separating the lineages from the founding haplotype from Wuhan (the central haplotype of clade A). Although the sequencing efforts vary considerably among populations, it is clear that the geographical distribution of clades is highly structured. Thus, A and B haplotypes are common in East Asia, whereas the B1a haplotype appears to be at the center of the outbreak on the West Coast of the United States, and A2a and its descendants are almost exclusively found in European populations.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !l self assert = The composition of haplotypes changed substantially from early targeted testing to later targeted testing. The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes, which had collectively made up 103 of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early-targeted testing, were reduced to 115 of 361 haplotypes (31.9%) in the later-targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and other A2a-derived haplotypes. This change probably meant that population screening identified clusters of infected persons who seeded infection from areas that had not been designated as high risk, such as the United Kingdom. The relatively high prevalence of A1a and A2a clades in the later-targeted testing group was unsurprising: the targeted testing had been extended to include those who had traveled to additional high-risk areas, and population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform tracking efforts.

    let !o self assert = Haplotype analysis of the contact tracing network shows one of the most complex contact-tracing networks, in which clusters of persons returning from Italy or Austria transmitted the virus to persons in Iceland. The figure shows a network of 14 persons who were infected in Iceland. Haplotype analysis showed that these persons were infected by viruses with the A2a1 haplotype, more commonly imported from northern Italy than from Austria. This cluster also contained persons with a mutation that was specific to Iceland. The cluster can be traced to a person who had both mutated and wild-type haplotypes; those whom this person infected had only the mutated haplotype. We searched for persons carrying these mutations who were not associated with this cluster and found two who had probably been infected by someone in the cluster through an unknown contact.

    head = We found that COVID-19 patients in their incubation period were at least as infectious as during their illness period. SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.

    >>> Background
      As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive.

    >>> Methods
      Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and theinfectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.

    >>> Results
      A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (≥60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51- 0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.

    >>> Conclusions
      SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.

    let !a self assert =  A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days.

    let !b self assert = Within households, the non-primary attack rate was much lower in contacts <20 years group, 5.26% (95% CI 2.43, 9.76%), as compared to 13.72% (95% CI 10.68, 17.24%) and 17.69% (95% CI: 11.89, 24.83%) in 20-59 year olds and ≥60 year olds, respectively (p-values <0.005). A similar age trend was observed among non-household contacts, but the differences were not of statistical significance.There was no gender difference in the non-primary attack rates, for both inside and outside the household.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !c self assert = The overall non-primary attack rates are 12.6% and 3.06% among household and nonhousehold contacts, respectively.

    let !d self assert = Most cases were found in the densely populated districts (56% of the total population in Guangzhou) including Yuexiu, Liwan, Haizhu, Tianhe and Baiyun. Three clusters with 5 or more secondary cases (not counting tertiary or further generations) were observed, one in each of Yuexiu, Haizhu and Baiyun districts, and all primary cases in these clusters were imported. The longest transmission chain had three subsequent generations from the primary case, which occurred in Panyu district. Five other clusters had two subsequent generations. The reported residential locations of primary and nonprimary cases within the same clusters are mostly identical, but non-household non-primary cases might live far from the primary cases. Most transmissions occurred between household members

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !e self assert = COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51- 0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !f self assert = When household contact is defined based on close relatives, we estimate the household SAR as 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) and the non-household SAR as 7.1% (95% CI: 4.7-10.6%), had there been no case isolation. A longer incubation periods is associated with a slightly lower, whereas a longer infectious period is associated with a slightly higher, SAR estimate. The household SAR varies from 12% to 17%, and the non-household SAR varied from 6% to 9%.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !g self assert = The local R based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was estimated to be 0.48 (0.39, 0.58), which is insensitive to the setting for the incubation and infectious periods. In other words, a typical case infected 0.48 individuals on average in Guangzhou, implying an inefficient transmission of the disease under the control measures. The projected local R, had there been no quarantine of cases, was estimated as 0.62 (0.51-0.75). High estimates of projected local R were associated with short incubation and longer infectious periods

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !h self assert = The daily transmission probability during the incubation period tends to be similar to that during the illness period, with an estimated odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (0.59-2.18); however, the difference is much wider when longer incubation periods were assumed.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !i self assert = Individuals ≥60 years old were the most susceptible group to COVID-19. In comparison to the elderly group (≥60 years old), the odds of infection is 0.27 (0.13-0.55) in the youngest group (<20 years old) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.54-1.20) in the younger adult group (20-59 years old). These age effects on susceptibility are insensitive to the assumptions about the natural history of disease. Cases <60 years old were slightly less infectious than those ≥60 years old, with ORs varying in the range of 0.73- 0.79 but not significantly different.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !j self assert = Restricting household contacts to those who were living at the same address as the primary case led to higher SAR estimates among household contacts, 16.4-23.4%, but lower SAR estimates among the non-household contacts under the various settings of the natural history of disease. Under the setting of the shortest incubation and infectious periods, the SAR was estimated as 19.3% (95% CI: 15.51-23.86%). The age effects and the relative infectivity of the illness period vs. the incubation period remained qualitatively similar.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !k self assert = We are the first to quantify the infectivity of COVID-19 patients during their incubation period using contact-tracing data, but qualitative evidence has been noted before. In our unpublished analysis of a separate dataset of case clusters in China, the mean serial interval (time between symptom onsets of a primary and a secondary  case) was shorter than the mean incubation period, suggesting that infectivity during the incubation period is not trivial. This finding has a profound implication on prevention and control strategies, e.g., the necessity of testing asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and the importance of wearing facial mask regardless of symptoms in order to curb the pandemic.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !l self assert = We estimated the local reproductive number to be relatively low, around 0.48, which is consistent with the average level of. We projected that, without isolation of cases and their contacts, the local reproductive number would have been about 30% higher to reach 0.62 in our primary analysis setting. This moderate effect of isolation is partly due to high infectivity during the incubation period, that is, many secondary cases had been infected before or shortly after the symptom onset of the primary cases before the primary cases were identified and isolated. This observation also implies that the low reproductive number in Guangzhou possibly resulted more from policies restricting human movement, limiting the number of contacts of COVID-19 cases during their entire infectious period including the incubation period, than from the detection and isolation of cases and close contacts.

  ref 'Lavezzo_et_al_2020
    head = This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.

    >>> Abstract
      On the 21st of February 2020 a resident of the municipality of Vo, a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.

    let !d self assert = We found that none of the children who took part in the study tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at either survey had a positive swab, despite at least 13 of them living together with infected family members. This is particularly intriguing in the light of the very high observed odd ratio for adults to become infected when living together with SARS-CoV-2 positive family members. However, this result does not mean that children cannot be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !e self assert = The analysis of the contacts of the 8 new infections identified in the second survey, where we found that one had a history of close contact with asymptomatic individuals and two lived in the same household with asymptomatic relatives, suggests that asymptomatic infections can transmit the virus. The observation that the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) in asymptomatic infections does not significantly differ from that of symptomatic infections (p values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) further corroborates this hypothesis and the high frequency of asymptomatic infection detected across the surveys poses clear challenges for the control of COVID-19 in the absence of strict social distancing measures.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !f self assert = Analysis of the transmission chains showed that clusters of infection occurred in the early phases of the epidemic and produced initial estimates of the effective reproduction number of mean 3.0 (95% CI 2.5-3.5). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction also revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !g self assert = Our results suggest that average durations of virus detectability in swabs between 4 and 8 days match more closely the observed prevalence of infection than longer durations). This estimate is consistent with the observed distribution of the time from symptoms onset to confirmation which has mean 5.7 days (95% CI 1.6 – 12.3). The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4).

  ref 'Wang_et_al_2005
    head =  In this report we summarized the results from an epidemiological investigation of a SARS outbreak in a hospital in Tianjin, between April and May 2003. We collected epidemiological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of SARS associated with the outbreak. Transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated. The outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters. All SARS cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people.

    >>> Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease with a high case-fatality rate and devastating socio-economic impact. In this report we summarized the results from an epidemiological investigation of a SARS outbreak in a hospital in Tianjin, between April and May 2003. We collected epidemiological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of SARS associated with the outbreak. Transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated. The outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters. All SARS cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people. The patients ranged from 16 to 82 years of age (mean age 38·5 years); 38·7% were men. The overall case fatality in the SARS outbreak was 11·7% (13/111). The outbreak lasted around 4 weeks after the index case was identified. SARS is a highly contagious condition associated with substantial case fatality; an outbreak can result from one patient in a relatively short period. However, stringent public health measures seemed to be effective in breaking the disease transmission chain.

    let !a self assert = Outbreak in Tianjin was initiated by a single patient from Beijing. The index case was treated in three hospitals in Tianjin and infected a large number of persons. In Hospital P alone, 33 SARS patients were directly infected by the index case.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !b self assert = Patient M clinical symptoms and examination results made one attending physician suspect SARS. Further investigation revealed the contact history with SARS in the Beijing hospital. Based on his clinical symptoms and contact history, patient M was immediately listed as a suspect SARS case. At 11:30 hours on 17 April, he was transferred to Tianjin Thorax Disease Hospital. He was treated there for 2 days before being transferred again to Tianjin Infectious Disease Hospital on 19 April at around midnight, where he died. Cases occurred after exposure to patient M in both these other hospitals and have been documented elsewhere. Briefly, 164 of the total 175 SARS in this city can be traced to patient M.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !c self assert = Of the 1140 hospital staff and patients in this hospital at the time, 111 were diagnosed as either suspect or probable cases. The crude attack rate was 9-7%. Among all cases observed in this hospital, 33 were infected directly from patient M and 89 of all 111 SARS patients in the hospital could be traced to him.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !d self assert = The latent period for the secondary cases varied from 2 to 11 days with a median latent time of 4 days. The outbreak started on 16 April, peaked on 24 April and lasted until 12 May.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !e self assert = Of the 111 people who became infected in Hospital P, 81-1% (90/111) of them were probable cases. The SARS infection pattern in Hospital P is consistent with a person-to-person transmission pattern. Cardiology Unit I, where the index patient was first seen, had the highest number of SARS patients.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !f self assert = However, the SARS outbreak in Hospital P as well as in Tianjin came under control after Tianjin municipal authorities, at various levels, acted aggressively to implement stringent measures to enhance active surveillance, isolate SARS patients, and quarantine those having possible contact with SARS patients. These measures proved effective and SARS transmission was halted.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !g self assert = Compared with the outbreak in Beijing where effective SARS control was delayed for several weeks, stringent transmission control measures in Tianjin started sooner (i.e. 4 days) after the index case was identified. As a result, there were fewer community transmissions in Tianjin and a large proportion of SARS cases occurred within medical settings. The number of cases from Hospital P accounted for 51-4 % of the SARS cases in Tianjin.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !h self assert = The term SARS super-spreader has been used to describe certain individuals who have been implicated in spreading SARS to numerous other individuals. SARS super-spreaders were noticed in several SARS outbreaks in 2003. The SARS outbreak in Tianjin as described in this paper seems typical of an outbreak associated with super-spreaders. While it is not clear whether super-spreaders are associated with more contagious viral strains or simply a result of unprotected natural transmission, it highlights the critical importance of early intervention in controlling SARS transmission.

    / December, 2005 - Epidemiol. Infect
    let !i self assert = Finally, this study only describes the outbreak in Hospital P. Most of the SARS cases in Tianjin occurred in this hospital. Thus, this study reflects one major component of the outbreak of SARS in Tianjin, providing a snapshot of a SARS outbreak in one hospital. Our findings add to our understanding of disease control, which may help us to better prepare to confront other emerging diseases in the future.

  // A Major Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Hong Kong
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa030685
  ref 'Lee_et_al_2003
    head = We report an outbreak in our hospital of a deadly pneumonia, which caused rapid deterioration of pulmonary function requiring ICU admission in 23.2 percent of cases and mechanical ventilation in 13.8 percent. Within a period of less than two months, SARS has become a global health problem, prompting the WHO to issue a global alert for the first time in more than a decade.

    >>> Background
      There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. We report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 cases of suspected SARS during a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong.

    >>> Methods
      From March 11 to 25, 2003, all patients with suspected SARS after exposure to an index patient or ward were admitted to the isolation wards of the Prince of Wales Hospital. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

    >>> Results
      There were 66 male patients and 72 female patients in this cohort, 69 of whom were health care workers. The most common symptoms included fever (in 100 percent of the patients); chills, rigors, or both (73.2 percent); and myalgia (60.9 percent). Cough and headache were also reported in more than 50 percent of the patients. Other common findings were lymphopenia (in 69.6 percent), thrombocytopenia (44.8 percent), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels (71.0 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively). Peripheral air-space consolidation was commonly observed on thoracic computed tomographic scanning. A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04).

    >>> Conclusions
      SARS is a serious respiratory illness that led to significant morbidity and mortality in our cohort.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !a self assert = SARS developed in 69 health care workers and 16 medical students, all with unremarkable medical histories, after exposure at work in the medical ward for men where our index patient was hospitalized. The high infectivity was also demonstrated by the fact that there were 26 tertiary cases, which included family members of the infected health care workers.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !b self assert = We suspected that the infection was transmitted by droplets and possibly by fomites, and we therefore instituted both airborne precautions (e.g., use of the N-95 respirator) and contact precautions (e.g., use of gowns and gloves), as recommended by the CDC. However, the use of a jet nebulizer to administer aerosolized albuterol in the index patient had probably aggravated the spread of the disease by droplet infections.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !c self assert = In our cohort, most of the common bacterial pathogens were ruled out, in addition to viral diseases such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection. Moreover, lack of a response to the initial antimicrobial treatment we provided led to the suspicion that we were dealing with a novel virus that causes lower respiratory tract infection.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !d self assert = In the first 138 cases, we have identified several cardinal symptoms of SARS. Besides fever, chills, and rigor, which were present in more than 70 percent of cases, cough was present in more than 50 percent and dizziness in more than 40 percent of cases. Rigor may represent the viremic phase of the disease, which subsided gradually as the illness progressed. In addition, moderate lymphopenia and its subsequent progression, thrombocytopenia, a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels, and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels were prevalent in the early phase of the illness in our cohort; all these findings are quite different from those associated with pneumonia caused by usual bacterial pathogens. Although these symptoms and laboratory findings are nonspecific, the constellation of these features should alert medical practitioners to the possibility of SARS.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !e self assert = We have also found that the chest radiograph offers an important diagnostic clue to this condition. Typically, our patients presented with unilateral, predominantly peripheral areas of consolidation. After approximately one week, it progressed rapidly to bilateral patchy consolidation, and the extent of the lung opacities was correlated with the deterioration in respiratory function. In cases in which plain chest radiographs appeared normal in the presence of a high spiking fever and lymphopenia, CT of the thorax was a sensitive imaging approach for the diagnosis. The characteristic finding on CT was bilateral peripheral air-space ground-glass consolidation mimicking that in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !f self assert = In fact, the similarity of this radiographic picture to that of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and the similarity of the histologic features to those of early ARDS in postmortem studies have prompted us to use corticosteroids in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of SARS. In ARDS and particularly in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, corticosteroid therapy has been used with some success.7 The majority of our cohort appeared to have a response to corticosteroid therapy, in addition to ribavirin, with resolution of fever and lung opacities within two weeks.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !g self assert = In this study, we were able to identify some clinical and laboratory features on presentation that were associated with the adverse clinical outcome of respiratory failure requiring care in the ICU or death. Univariate analyses showed that advanced age, male sex, a high neutrophil count, a high peak creatine kinase level, high initial and peak lactate dehydrogenase levels, and a low serum sodium level were associated with an adverse outcome.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !h self assert = Only advanced age, a high neutrophil count, and a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level were independent predictors. Since high lactate dehydrogenase levels are often seen in association with tissue damage, we propose that this finding indicates more extensive lung injury. The significant association between a high neutrophil count and an adverse outcome remains to be explained.

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !i self assert = A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions (in our analyses, coexisting illness was not correlated with a poor outcome, probably because of the small number of such patients). In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04).

    / May, 2003 - N Engl J Med
    let !j self assert = SARS has already become a global health hazard, and its high infectivity is alarming. The discovery of the infective agent and studies of its behavior are crucial to an understanding of this new disease. A reliable, rapid diagnostic test, based on blood samples or nasopharyngeal aspirates, is of great importance in the future management of this disease. Until such a diagnostic test is available, a clear picture of its clinical presentation will help physicians be on the alert for this condition. Early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate therapy are the keys in combating this deadly infection.

    head = The central role of R0 in epidemic analysis is unassailable, but our findings show that emerging disease outbreaks cannot be fully understood if individual variation in infectiousness is neglected. Examination of other population processes dependent on small numbers of individuals may yield similar insights. Our findings also indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.

    >>> Abstract
      Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous ‘superspreading events’ in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.

    let !b self assert = Comparing results for eight directly transmitted infections reveals the differing degree of individual variation among diseases and outbreak settings. The Poisson offspring distribution is almost always strongly rejected. The geometric model has considerable support for several data sets, which indicates significant individual variation in transmission rates because real infectious periods are less dispersed than the exponential distribution. The negative binomial model is selected decisively for several data sets, and enables comparative study of diseases through the dispersion parameter.

    let !f self assert = For outbreaks avoiding stochastic extinction, epidemic growth rates strongly depend on variation in ν. Diseases with high individual variation show infrequent but explosive epidemics after introduction of a single case. This pattern recalls SARS in 2003, for which many settings experienced no epidemic despite unprotected exposure to SARS cases27,28, whereas a few cities suffered explosive outbreaks. Our results, using k̂ = 0.16 for SARS, explain this simply by the presence or absence of high-ν individuals in the early generations of each outbreak6. In contrast, conventional models (with k = 1 or k → ∞) cannot simultaneously generate frequent failed invasions and rapid growth rates without additional, subjective model structure.

    let !g self assert = We analysed contact tracing data from four outbreaks before and after imposition of control measures. Control always lowered the estimated dispersion parameter (that is k̂c < k̂) as predicted by the individual-specific model, although small sample sizes often led to overlapping confidence intervals. This increased skew in transmission arose chiefly from undiagnosed or misdiagnosed individuals, who continued to infect others (and even cause SSEs), whereas controlled individuals infected very few. To further examine our control theories, we calculated  and  for each data set; k̂c was always closer to , although twice it fell between the two predictions, indicating a possible combination of control mechanisms. Real-world control thus seems to increase individual variation, favouring extinction but risking ongoing SSEs. Larger data sets are needed to establish this pattern definitively.

Focusing half of all control effort on the most infectious 20% of cases is up to threefold more effective than random control. When k = 0.1 or 0.5, outbreak containment is assured for targeted control levels at roughly half the threshold level of c = 1 - 1/R0 for random control. Gains in efficiency increase with more intense targeting of high-ν cases, but saturate as overall coverage c increases. Again, branching process theory generalizes these findings: for a given proportion c of individuals controlled, greater targeting of higher-ν individuals leads to lower effective reproductive number R and higher extinction probability q

    let !i self assert = At a minimum, we propose a new measure for inclusion in outbreak reports: the proportion of cases not transmitting (p0), which, together with R0 is sufficient to estimate the degree of variation in ν. As more data become available, trends may emerge in the degree of variation present, for example, for different modes of spread or levels of virulence. Richer data sets may also enable testing of the branching process assumption that case outcomes are independent and identically distributed, by detecting possible correlations in ν values within transmission lineages or systematic changes as outbreaks progress.

  // Outbreak of Tuberculosis among Regular Patrons of a Neighborhood Bar
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199507273330404
  ref 'Kline_et_al_1995
    head = We report an outbreak caused by nonresidential exposure at a neighborhood bar. A highly infectious person with cavitary tuberculosis spent much of his time at the bar for several months. He became increasingly symptomatic, yet remained untreated and without a diagnosis. Mental health problems and chronic alcoholism effectively blocked his access to health care. The result was an outbreak of tuberculosis among those who frequented the bar. The outbreak had a substantial impact on community health, contributing 35 percent of all new active cases of tuberculosis in Minneapolis during 1992.

    >>> Background
      Outbreaks of tuberculosis have been reported in prisons, nursing homes, urban homeless shelters, and other crowded settings. We report a nonresidential outbreak of tuberculosis that originated in a neighborhood bar.

    >>> Methods
      A homeless patient with highly infectious pulmonary tuberculosis was a regular patron of a neighborhood bar during a long symptomatic interval before diagnosis. We investigated 97 other regular customers and employees of the bar through interviews, tuberculin skin testing, and chest roentgenography. We performed DNA fingerprinting on isolates from the index patient and 11 other patients.

    >>> Results
      The index patient apparently infected 41 of 97 contacts (42 percent), resulting in 14 cases of active tuberculosis and 27 cases of infection but no disease (indicated by positive tuberculin skin tests). Four other cases of active tuberculosis occurred among regular customers of the bar who were missed by the contact investigation. There were also two secondary cases. Radiographic findings in active cases included upper-lobe disease in seven cases (three cavitary) and negative chest films at the time of diagnosis in four cases. All 12 culture isolates we tested had the same chromosomal-DNA restriction pattern.

    >>> Conclusions
      The spread of tuberculosis in a neighborhood bar can be a major public health problem. The high rate of infection and disease among the contacts was unexpected and was not due to coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Possible explanations include heavy alcohol use among the contacts, high infectivity of the index case, or both. Sputum cultures must be performed in tuberculin-positive contacts who have symptoms, even if the chest films are normal.

    let !a self assert = The index patient had a progressively worsening cough, and over a period of six months his weight declined from 80 to 49 kg. There was no intervention, however, even though he was eligible for health care under government programs. There was a public clinic within six blocks of the bar and a public hospital within three miles, yet he did not seek health care, nor did any of the bars employees or customers intervene.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !b self assert = Instead, the patient went untreated until he could barely stand unassisted, had extensive destruction of lung tissue, and had infected numerous others. His alcoholism and mental health problems were a highly effective barrier to health care. Though it would have been difficult, early intervention would probably have reduced the extent of the outbreak.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !c self assert = The index patient proved highly infectious. Forty-one of 97 contacts (42 percent) interviewed at the bar were infected. Active tuberculosis developed in 14 of 97 (14 percent). These numbers are higher than expected. In a typical contact investigation, approximately 20 to 30 percent of the close contacts have positive tuberculin skin tests and in only 1 or 2 percent does active tuberculosis develop.

    let !d self assert = Also higher than expected was the proportion of the people we surveyed who were infected but without disease initially (i.e., they had positive tuberculin skin tests, normal chest films, and no symptoms), yet who later progressed to active disease.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !e self assert = Nineteen such people were offered isoniazid prophylaxis. Six completed therapy and remained well, but 13 refused preventive therapy or were noncompliant. In 3 of these 13 (23 percent), active tuberculosis developed within two years.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !f self assert = Typically, in approximately 5 percent of the people who convert to positive tuberculin skin tests, active tuberculosis develops in one year, and in an additional 5 percent it develops at some time during their lives.10 A higher rate of active disease after conversion of the tuberculin test is expected among people infected in infancy, during puberty and adolescence, and in senescence, and those infected with HIV.10,11 However, all the contacts at the bar in whom active tuberculosis developed were adults, and only one was HIV-positive.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !g self assert = Our study suggests that initial infection may progress to active disease more frequently in heavy alcohol users. Another factor contributing to the high incidence of both infection and active disease at the bar may have been the high infectivity of the index patient.

    let !h self assert = RFLP analysis proved very useful in our investigation and supplemented standard epidemiologic procedures. The same 15 repeats of the insertion sequence were found in all the isolates we tested. The genetic fingerprint of the outbreak strain helped prove linkage among the infected people, including one person with exogenous reinfection, four with upper-lobe disease that resembled endogenous reactivation, and two who were missed by the contact investigation and presented more than two years later.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !i self assert = In a study of an outbreak of tuberculosis in a homeless shelter, Nardell and colleagues also identified cases of exogenous reinfection and of upper-lobe disease resembling endogenous reinfection. They used phage typing and the resistance patterns of culture isolates to link cases to the outbreak. Our findings support their conclusion that the radiographic pattern of disease may not distinguish reactivation tuberculosis from primary infection acquired during an outbreak.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !j self assert = Four symptomatic participants had positive sputum cultures but negative chest films. Active pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with negative chest films, an underappreciated combination, has been reported, particularly in immunocompromised patients. In the context of a contact investigation, a negative chest film in a tuberculin-positive subject does not rule out active tuberculosis.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !k self assert = The cost of failing to complete prophylactic treatment was very high. Of 13 tuberculin-positive contacts who refused isoniazid prophylaxis or did not comply with the regimen, 3 had their conditions progress to active tuberculosis within two years.

    / July, 1995 - N Engl J Med
    let !l self assert = Our experience suggests that chronic alcoholism is such a high-risk factor for progression to active disease that major efforts to ensure completion of six months of isoniazid therapy are worthwhile for tuberculin-positive heavy drinkers who are close contacts of people with active disease.

  ref 'Woolhouse_et_al_1997
    head = From an analysis of the distributions of measures of transmission rates among hosts, we identify an empirical relationship suggesting that, typically, 20% of the host population contributes at least 80% of the net transmission potential, as measured by the basic reproduction number, R0. This is an example of a statistical pattern known as the 20/80 rule. The rule applies to a variety of disease systems, including vector-borne parasites and sexually transmitted pathogens. The rule implies that control programs targeted at the “core” 20% group are potentially highly effective and, conversely, that programs that fail to reach all of this group will be much less effective than expected in reducing levels of infection in the population as a whole.

    let !a self assert = The results suggest that heterogeneities in contact rates lead to consistent and substantial increases in the value of R0, by factors in the range 2 to 4 for vector-borne infections and considerably higher for STDs. This may well apply to other infectious agents where “contact” is less easy to quantify. In practice, additional heterogeneities are also likely to contribute to the effects on R0.

    let !b self assert = In the case of the STD study from France, only 13% of the adult population had any new sexual partners during 1 year and thus made any contribution to R0 over that time scale. For all other nine data sets, Rc can reduced by more than 80% of R0 by removing 20% of households or individuals; we refer to this empirical observation as the 20/80 rule.

    / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
    let !c self assert = Biting by mosquitoes of humans is not random, and attractiveness may be related to sex, skin surface area (hence age), and other factors. Susceptibility to schistosome infection varies with the nature of contacts, possibly with skin thickness and lipid content and may be related to genetic factors. Risk of STD transmission is affected by the frequency and type of sexual acts and by cofactors. Acquired immunity may also affect host susceptibility to infection (55, 56), but this is not relevant to analyses of R0, which is defined with respect to a fully susceptible (naive) population. The magnitude of the effect of these other heterogeneities at the population level is unknown; but they will not decrease R0 unless negatively correlated with the variables analyzed here.

    / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
    let !d self assert = There may also be effects of “higher order” heterogeneities, all of which may further increase R0: heterogeneities in the distribution of vectors; differing usage of different water contact sites; patterns of contact between highly sexually active and less sexually active groups, and differences between the sexes (58). Consistency through time of the heterogeneities in transmission rates is also important.

    / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
    let !e self assert = Clearly, if the relative contribution of each host subgroup to R0 is itself variable then the fraction to be targeted must be continually reappraised. For human malaria in Tanzania over 12 months and in Papua New Guinea over 28 months, and for canine leishmaniasis over consecutive years, there is little variation in the relative abundance of vectors compared across households. Such information is not available for behaviors associated with the transmission of either schistosomiasis or STDs. It is important that the time scale of the observation of contact rates is sufficient to properly characterize their distribution across the host population

    / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
    let !f self assert = Although the actual values of R0 for any given infectious agent will vary between locations and through time, the heterogeneities in transmission rates recorded in this study suggest that targeted interventions can, in principle, induce very substantial reductions in rates of infection. This has been suggested before, but the novelty of the result lies in the apparent conformity with the 20/80 rule found across widely different host–parasite associations and in the relative magnitude of the contribution to the transmission potential (over 80%) made by a small fraction (20%) of the host population.

    / January, 1997 - The National Academy of Sciences of the USA
    let !g self assert = In the application of this empirical rule the key issues will be the methods used and the costs entailed in identifying the “core” transmitters. Put simply, if the cost of identifying and treating the core 20% is less than the cost of treating the entire population then targeting control interventions such as vaccination, drug treatment, or exposure protection may be preferred to nontargeted interventions on economic grounds. What is lacking in public health research into disease control is a quantitative assessment of the relative costs and effects. The 20/80 rule should encourage efforts to make such assessments.

    >>> Abstract
      The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.

    >>> Summary
      Early studies that explored host-pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.

    >>> Abstract
      The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARSCoV-2 undergo intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is necessary to determine if this remains true.

  // Pregnancy upregulates angiotensin type 2 receptor expression and increases blood flow in uterine arteries of rats
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioy130
  ref 'Mishra_et_al_2018
    head = This study demonstrates that pregnancy causes a reprogramming of the Ang II receptor expression pattern, resulting in ontogenic increase in uterine arterial AT2R levels that coincides with Ang II increase and relates to the onset and magnitude of uterine blood flow increase in pregnant rats. Estrogens appear to directly upregulate uterine vascular AT2R independent of any endogenous factors. This suggests that local uterine vascular RAS, in addition to central RAS, may play an important role in maintenance of blood flow to the uteroplacental unit.

    >>> Abstract
      Normal pregnancy is associated with decreased uterine vascular contraction and increased blood flow even though angiotensin II (AngII) levels are increased. AngII not only activates the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) to mediate vasoconstriction but also angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) to cause vasodilation. We hypothesized that upregulation of AT2R expression and function accounts for increased uterine artery blood flow during pregnancy. Virgin, pregnant (at different days of gestation) and post-partum Sprague-Dawley rats were used to determine uterine artery hemodynamics using micro ultrasound and plasma angiotensin II levels by ELISA. Isolated uterine arteries were examined for AT1R and AT2R expression and isometric contraction/relaxation. Plasma AngII levels were steady up to mid-pregnancy, increased as pregnancy advanced, reaching a peak in late pregnancy, and then restored to pre-pregnant levels after delivery. The pattern of increase in AngII levels mirrored a parallel increase in uterine blood flow. AT1R expression did not change, but AT2R expression increased during pregnancy correlating with uterine blood flow increase. Treatment with the AT2R antagonist PD123319 reduced uterine arterial blood flow. Vasoconstriction to angiotensin II was blunted in pregnant rats. Treatment with PD123319 caused greater enhancement of AngII contraction in pregnant than virgin rats. Ex vivo exposure of estradiol to uterine arterial rings dose dependently upregulated AT2R expression, that was inhibited by estrogen receptor antagonist. These results demonstrate that elevated AngII levels during gestation induce an increase in uterine blood flow via heightened AT2R-mediated signaling. Estrogens appear to directly upregulate uterine vascular AT2R independent of any endogenous factors.

Importantly, inhibition of estradiol receptors with ICI 182,780 abolished estradiol-induced upregulation of AT2R mRNA (n = 6) and protein (n = 5) (and B; P < 0.05), suggesting a direct effect of estradiol on AT2R expression in uterine arteries in an estradiol receptor-dependent manner.

    / November, 2018 - Biology of Reproduction
    let !e self assert = This is consistent with the finding that estradiol upregulates AT2R in the kidneys and myometrium. Possible mechanisms include modulation of AT2R transcription through estrogen response elements. Although the AT2R promoter does not contain estrogen response elements, estrogen may activate AT2R transcription from alternative response elements such as the activator protein site (AP-1). Intriguingly, estradiol does not upregulate AT2R expression in the lungs and urinary bladder. Why estradiol selectively regulates AT2R expression in certain tissues but not others remain to be clarified.

    head = Our use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all pregnant patients presenting for delivery revealed that at this point in the pandemic in New York City, most of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery were asymptomatic, and more than one of eight asymptomatic patients who were admitted to the labor and delivery unit were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although this prevalence has limited generalizability to geographic regions with lower rates of infection, it underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients. Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.

  // Impact of statin therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) depends on ARDS severity: a prospective observational cohort study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0368-6
  ref 'Mansur_et_al_2015
    head = The main finding of this investigation was that patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS who received statin therapy had a significantly better 28-day survival rate compared with those without this therapy. This evidence of a beneficial impact of statin continuation on severe ARDS patients suggests that statin therapy should be continued for all critically ill patients who are at high risk of developing sepsis or infection, i.e., those undergoing surgical procedures with a high infection risk.

    >>> Background
      Previous investigations have presumed a potential therapeutic effect of statin therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Statins are expected to attenuate inflammation in the lungs of patients with ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical investigations of the role of statin therapy have revealed contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate whether pretreatment and continuous therapy with statins in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS are associated with 28-day survival according to disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe).

    >>> Methods
      Patients with sepsis-associated ARDS from the surgical intensive care were enrolled in this prospective observational investigation. ARDS was classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe); 28-day mortality was recorded as the primary outcome variable and organ failure was recorded as secondary outcome variable. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the requirements for organ support were evaluated throughout the observational period to assess organ failure.

    >>> Results
      404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS were enrolled in this investigation. The distribution of the ARDS subgroups was 13 %, 59 %, and 28 % for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Statin therapy improved 28-day survival exclusively in the patients with severe ARDS compared with patients without statin therapy (88.5 % and 62.5 %, respectively; P = 0.0193). To exclude the effects of several confounders, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis, which showed that statin therapy remained a significant covariate for mortality (hazard ratio, 5.46; 95 % CI, 1.38–21.70; P = 0.0156). Moreover, after carrying a propensity score-matching in the severe ARDS cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the improved 28-day survival among patients with statin therapy (P = 0.0205). Patients with severe ARDS who received statin therapy had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those without statin therapy (13 ± 7 and 9 ± 7, respectively; P = 0.0034), and they also required less extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and had more ECMO-free days (18 ± 9 and 15 ± 9, respectively; P = 0.0873).

    >>> Conclusions
      This investigation suggests a beneficial effect of continuous statin therapy in patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS and a history of prior statin therapy. Further study is warranted to elucidate this potential effect.

    let !b self assert = We found that the beneficial impact of statin therapy was accompanied by significantly lower organ-specific SOFA scores in three organ systems (the cardiovascular, central nervous, and hepatic systems) among the patients on statin therapy. The observed lower cardiovascular scores might have been due to anti-inflammatory effects of the statin therapy, which inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators and resulted in less vasodilatation in the patients in this group

    / June, 2015 - BMC Medicine
    let !f self assert = Similarly, the observed lower hepatic SOFA scores can be explained by the fact that statin therapy has a beneficial effect on liver function. As shown by Arnaud et al., statins exert direct anti-inflammatory effects on hepatocytes by reducing IL-6-induced CRP production.

  ref 'Simonnet_et_al_2020
    head = This cohort study showed that obesity is a factor in disease severity of SARS-CoV2, having greatest impact in patients with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2. Patients with obesity and especially those with severe obesity should take extra measures to avoid COVID-19 contamination by enforcing prevention during the current pandemic.

    >>> Objective
      The Covid‐19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America, where obesity is highly prevalent. The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has not been fully documented.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective cohort study we analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS‐CoV‐2, in a single French center.

    >>> Results
      Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (p<0.01, Chi square test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (p<0.05) and BMI (p<0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 vs patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 was 7.36 (1.63‐33.14; p=0.02)

    >>> Conclusion
      The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS‐CoV‐2. Disease severity increased with BMI. Obesity is a risk factor for SARS‐CoV‐2 severity requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.

  ref 'Wyllie_et_al_2020
    head = The results indicate that using saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection is more sensitive and consistent than using nasopharyngeal swabs. Overall, we demonstrate that saliva should be considered as a reliable sample type to alleviate COVID-19 testing demands.

    >>> Abstract
      Rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is essential for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.

    let !b self assert = When limiting our analysis to only patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples (n = 38 for each sample type), we found that SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva were significantly higher than nasopharyngeal swabs ( p = 0.0001, Wilcoxon test;). Moreover, we detected SARS-CoV-2 from the saliva but not the nasopharyngeal swabs from eight matching samples (21%), while we only detected SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs and not saliva from three matched samples (8%). Overall, we found higher SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva than nasopharyngeal swabs from hospital inpatients.

In longitudinal saliva collections from 12 patients, however, there were no instances in which a sample tested negative and was later followed by a positive result. As true negative test results are important for clinicians to track patient improvements and for decisions regarding discharges, our data suggests that saliva is a more consistent sample type than nasopharyngeal swabs for monitoring temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 titers.

More importantly, we found that human RNase P detection was more variable from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from inpatients (p=0.0001, F test for variances) and self-collected from healthcare workers (p = 0.0002;). Our results suggest that saliva may also be an appropriate, and perhaps more sensitive, alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for screening asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. however, a larger sample size is needed to confirm.

    >>> Abstract
      Background: The effects of Covid-19 in pregnancy remain relatively unknown. We present a case of second trimester pregnancy with symptomatic Covid-19 complicated by severe preeclampsia and placental abruption. Methods: We analyzed placenta for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular and immunohistochemical assays and by and electron microscopy, and we measured the maternal antibody response in blood to this infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. Conclusion: This case demonstrates, for the first time, SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.

    >>> Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has brought about an unprecedented crisis, taking a heavy toll on human health, lives as well as the global economy. There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3μg or 6 μg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.

  doi: http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6130
  ref 'Pan_et_al_2020
    head = In this cohort study, the number of incident COVID-19 cases, rates of confirmed cases, and Rt were reduced and the outbreak was under improved control in Wuhan after implementation of multifaceted public health measures (including but not limited to intensive intracity and intercity traffic restriction, social distancing measures, home confinement and centralized quarantine, and improvement of medical resources).

    >>> Objective
      To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions.

    >>> Design, Setting and Participants
      In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients’ age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification.

    >>> Exposures
      Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey.

    >>> Main Outcomes and Measures
      Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods.

    >>> Results
      Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.

However, despite these interventions, the confirmed case rate continued to increase in the third period, perhaps in part due to shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and delayed diagnosis and access to medical treatment. Without rapid diagnosis, the risk of cross-infection in hospitals was high and patients likely continued to infect family members and close contacts. It has been reported that about 80% of the cluster transmission occurred in families in China.

    let !e self assert = Centralized quarantine of patients and close contacts appears to have been associated with a reduction in in-hospital, household, and community transmission. Between February 16 and 18, the government further initiated a door-to-door and individual-to-individual universal symptom survey to single out presumptive cases in the community, which was associated with further reductions in the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.

    head = Our findings suggest that the package of public health interventions (including border entry restrictions, quarantine and isolation of cases and contacts, and population behaviour changes, such as social distancing and personal protective measures) that Hong Kong has implemented since late January, 2020, is associated with reduced spread of COVID-19.

    >>> Background
      A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20–23, Feb 11–14, and March 10–13, 2020.

    >>> Findings
      COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34–53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26–1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70–0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24–43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06–1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68–0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively.

    >>> Interpretation
      Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

    head = We reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.

    >>> Abstract
      Cytokine storm during respiratory viral infection is an indicator of disease severity and poor prognosis. Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling has been reported to be causal in cytokine storm-associated pathology in several respiratory viral infections, however, the mechanisms by which IFN-I promotes disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that lack of deISGylation during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions, cytokine amplification, lung vascular leakage and death. This pathology requires T cells but not T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18. However, lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- or Usp18C61A mice which were dependent on Isg15. We further mechanistically demonstrate that interrupting the ISGylation/deISGylation circuit increases extracellular levels of ISG15 which is accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation to the lung. Importantly, neutrophil depletion reversed morbidity and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. In summary, we reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.

Our results demonstrate that proper ISGylation/deISGylation in LysM+ cells regulates extracellular ISG15 levels, and perturbation of this pathway results in lung immune pathology, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent Cl13 infection. Thus, we believe that LysM+ cells are major sources of extracellular ISG15 following persistent LCMV infection.

    let !c self assert = Dysregulated ISGylation/deISGylation in the absence of USP18 can be causal in aberrant immune inflammation in the lung. This hypothesis is further supported in humans, where ISG15 has been reported to stabilize USP18 and ISG15-null patients exhibit strong IFN-I signaling but display much less severe symptoms than USP18-loss of function patients, suggesting that secreted ISG15 may significantly contribute to symptoms observed in USP18-null patients. Furthermore, if free ISG15 contributes to disease pathogenesis in USP18- null patients, ISG15 levels can have prognostic value in assessing the potential for severe pathological outcomes in Usp18-deficient patients or following viral infections. Moreover, antibody neutralization or pharmacological inhibition of ISG15 signaling may be a viable means to alleviate pathology and mortality in USP18-deficient patients or during viral infection where IFN-I signaling correlates with severe pathological outcomes.

In support of this hypothesis, neutralization of IFN-γ reduced BALF levels of MPO and MMP9 in Usp18C61A mice.

  // No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060699
  ref 'Mahevas_et_al_2020
    head = We report a comparative study that uses real-world data collected from routine care to assess the efficacy and safety of HCQ in a population of 181 patients hospitalised for COVID19 hypoxemic pneumonia. We found that HCQ treatment at 600 mg/day added to standard of care was not associated with a reduction of admissions to ICUs or death 7 days after hospital admission, compared to standard of care alone. The rate of ARDS did not decrease either.

    >>> Background
      Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention because of positive results from small studies.

    >>> Method
      We used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen ≥ 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

    >>> Results
      This study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%) experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation.

    >>> Interpretation
       These results do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for documented SARS-CoV-2-positive hypoxic pneumonia.

  // Sero-Prevalence and Incidence of A/H1N1 2009 Influenza Infection in Scotland in Winter 2009–2010
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020358
  ref 'McLeish_et_al_2011
    head = Sero-prevalence overall (out of 1563 sample) in the adult population of Scotland is estimated to have been at least 44%  by early 2010. This would be expected to generate a significant degree of herd immunity and so, in the absence of significant change in the antigenicity of the virus, protect the population from a major epidemic of A/H1N1 2009 in the 2010–2011 influenza season.

    >>> Background
      Sero-prevalence is a valuable indicator of prevalence and incidence of A/H1N1 2009 infection. However, raw sero-prevalence data must be corrected for background levels of cross-reactivity (i.e. imperfect test specificity) and the effects of immunisation programmes

    >>> Methods and Findings
      We obtained serum samples from a representative sample of 1563 adults resident in Scotland between late October 2009 and April 2010. Based on a microneutralisation assay, we estimate that 44% (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 40–47%) of the adult population of Scotland were sero-positive for A/H1N1 2009 influenza by 1 March 2010. Correcting for background cross-reactivity and for recorded vaccination rates by time and age group, we estimated that 34% (27–42%) were naturally infected with A/H1N1 2009 by 1 March 2010. The central estimate increases to >40% if we allow for imperfect test sensitivity. Over half of these infections are estimated to have occurred during the study period and the incidence of infection in late October 2009 was estimated at 4.3 new infections per 1000 people per day (1.2 to 7.2), falling close to zero by April 2010. The central estimate increases to over 5.0 per 1000 if we allow for imperfect test specificity. The rate of infection was higher for younger adults than older adults. Raw sero-prevalences were significantly higher in more deprived areas (likelihood ratio trend statistic = 4.92,1 df, P = 0.03) but there was no evidence of any difference in vaccination rates.

    >>> Conclusions
      We estimate that almost half the adult population of Scotland were sero-positive for A/H1N1 2009 influenza by early 2010 and that the majority of these individuals (except in the oldest age classes) sero-converted as a result of natural infection with A/H1N1 2009. Public health planning should consider the possibility of higher rates of infection with A/H1N1 2009 influenza in more deprived areas.

Further work is needed to examine these possibilities.

  // Neutralising antibodies to SARS coronavirus 2 in Scottish blood donors - a pilot study of the value of serology to determine population exposure
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20060467

    head = The raw seroprevalence estimates obtained in the current study of blood donors  in Scotland were 0/500 and 6/500 at two sampling points in mid-March 2020. These estimates reflect the prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in this blood donor population over the preceding weeks.

    >>> Abstract
      Background. The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Findings. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd March; one further sample was reactive in an anti-spike ELISA. Interpretation. Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to 2-3 weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. Finally, it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals seroconvert and become reactive in the assays used. Serial follow up studies are needed to track infection and seroconversion in this and other similar populations However, these data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5
  ref 'Huang_et_al_2020
    head = 27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market. Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases.

    >>> Background
      A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.

    >>> Methods
      All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.

    >>> Findings
      By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.

    >>> Interpretation
      The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

    >>> Background
      Human infections with zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, have raised great public health concern globally. Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans.

    >>> Methods
      We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.

    >>> Results
      Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown β-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8
  ref 'Lu_et_at_2020
    head = Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from nine patients’ samples, showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003.

    >>> Background
      In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.

    >>> Methods
      We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.

    >>> Findings
      The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.

    >>> Interpretation
      2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99·9% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly.

Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV

    let !d self assert =  In both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) 36 acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.

    head = Compared to previously isolated SARS-CoV strains, 2019-nCoV likely uses human ACE2 less efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2002) but more efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2003). Because ACE2-binding affinity has been shown to be one of the most important determinants of SARS-CoV infectivity, 2019-nCoV has evolved the capability to infect humans and some capability to transmit among humans. Alarmingly, our data predict that a single N501T mutation (corresponding to the S487T mutation in SARS-CoV) may significantly enhance the binding affinity between 2019-nCoV RBD and human ACE2.

    >>> Abstract
      Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV’s capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.

    head = Three commercial CE-marked ELISA assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated using 30 serum samples from PCR-positive cases with SARS-CoV-2 and 82 control serum samples. Twenty nine of the 30 cases (97%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies by at least one of the three ELISA assays. In one case, only a positive IgA result was detected, while in another case antibody responses were negative by all tests.

    >>> Abstract
      Due to urgency and demand, numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoassays are rapidly being developed and placed on the market with limited validation on clinical samples. Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or non-coronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90%, 90%, and 65%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics > Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech > Artron Laboratories > Acro Biotech ≥ Hangzhou Alltest Biotech. Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.

Overall, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA had superior sensitivity and specificity compared to both Euroimmun IgA and IgG ELISAs.

    let !b self assert = The differences between the assays may, in part, be explained by the SARS-CoV-2 antigen targeted and the ELISA format used. Both kits detect antibodies to the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; however, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA only targets the RBD within the S1. The RBD represents approximately 33% of the S1 subunit, thus epitopes that may be recognized by cross-reacting epitopes outside of this domain are absent.

    let !c self assert =  Furthermore, the RBD is highly diverse between SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses (hCoVOC43 and hCoV-HKU1), which may further reduce the likelihood of cross-reaction with these circulating coronaviruses. Moreover, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA uses an antigen-antibody-antigen(peroxidase) format whereas the Euroimmun ELISAs employ an antigen-antibody-antibody(peroxidase) format. The specificity of the former is determined by a single antibody, whereas the latter has a second antibody that may introduce additional specificities. The antigen-antibody-antibody format is required to distinguish between specific antibody types, but may not necessarily have lead to decreased specificity as shown for in-house ELISA

SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM does not consistently appear before its IgG counterpart, with some studies reporting detection of SARS-CoV 2 spike protein-specific IgG before IgM.  While all the POC tests evaluated in this study are capable of detecting both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, the majority detected both antibody types simultaneously, even in the early convalescent phase, while some detected only IgG and others only IgM.

    / April, 2020 - medRxiv
    let !e self assert = Since the appearance of antibodies is time dependent, diagnosis of COVID-19 by serological methods is limited to patients with a longer duration of illness. Within seven days of symptom onset or in the acute phase of disease, nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples is superior to antibody detection for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, after eight days of illness, the sensitivity of serological assays surpasses that of nucleic acid testing. Here we reported a 100% seropositivity in patients 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

      The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside China with major outbreaks occurring in Italy, South Korea, and Iran. Phylogenetic analyses of whole-genome sequencing data identified a distinct SARS-CoV-2 clade linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia and New Zealand. This study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in Iran, and underscores the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases.

    head = Our investigation highlights several features of SARS transmission observed in multiple outbreaks, including the central role of hospitals in disease transmission, the difficulty in distinguishing SARS from other clinical symptoms, and the danger associated with delayed case detection and isolation. Our investigation suggests that superspreading was related to both the environment (e.g., hospitals where large numbers of contacts occur) and host (patients who were older and had more severe illness).

    >>> Abstract
      Superspreading events were pivotal in the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We investigated superspreading in one transmission chain early in Beijing’s epidemic. Superspreading was defined as transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts. An index patient with onset of SARS 2 months after hospital admission was the source of four generations of transmission to 76 case-patients, including 12 healthcare workers and several hospital visitors. Four (5%) case circumstances met the superspreading definition. Superspreading appeared to be associated with older age (mean 56 vs. 44 years), case fatality (75% vs. 16%, p = 0.02, Fisher exact test), number of close contacts (36 vs. 0.37) and attack rate among close contacts (43% vs. 18.5%, p < 0.025). Delayed recognition of SARS in a hospitalized patient permitted transmission to patients, visitors, and healthcare workers. Older age and number of contacts merit investigation in future studies of superspreading.

      Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.

    >>> Methods
      The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.

The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.

      The systematic study of large-scale networks has unveiled the ubiquitous presence of connectivity patterns characterized by large-scale heterogeneities and unbounded statistical fluctuations. These features affect dramatically the behavior of the diffusion processes occurring on networks, determining the ensuing statistical properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this article, we present a stochastic computational framework for the forecast of global epidemics that considers the complete worldwide air travel infrastructure complemented with census population data. We address two basic issues in global epidemic modeling: (i) we study the role of the large scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global diffusion pattern of emerging diseases; and (ii) we evaluate the reliability of forecasts and outbreak scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission and traffic flows. To address these issues we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern. These measures may be used for the analysis of containment policies and epidemic risk assessment.

  ref 'Mossong_et_al_2008
    head = One of the most important findings of this study is that the age and intensity patterns of contact are remarkably similar across different European countries even though the average number of contacts recorded differed. This similarity implies that the results may well be applicable to other European countries, and that the initial phase of spread of newly emerging infections in susceptible populations, such as SARS was in 2003, is likely to be very similar across Europe and in countries with similar social structures.

    >>> Background
      Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology.

    >>> Methods and Findings
      7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible.

    >>> Conclusions
      To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.

  ref 'Keeling_et_al_2005
    head = Approaches described in this paper thus far have assumed that there is some structure behind social interactions; this structure, the mixing network, determines the relationships that are permitted and the individuals capable of transmitting infection to each other.

    >>> Abstract
      Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a ‘mixing network’. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks—and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm—have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures.
      Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.

    head = Herd effect may in general be defined as the change (reduction) in the incidence of infection or disease in the un-intervened segment of a susceptible population due to the intervention in the rest of the population, compared to the incidence in the absence of intervention in the entire population. However, we have focused on the herd effect of immunisation programmes in this paper and we recommend that the term be qualified by the nature of intervention when appropriate (as due to early diagnosis and treatment, mass treatment etc). In ordinary use, when not qualified, herd effect will be taken as due to herd immunity.

    >>> Abstract
      The term herd immunity has been used by various authors to conform to different definitions. Earlier this situation had been identified but not corrected. We propose that it should have precise meaning for which purpose a new definition is offered: “the proportion of subjects with immunity in a given population”. This definition dissociates herd immunity from the indirect protection observed in the unimmunised segment of a population in which a large proportion is immunised, for which the term ‘herd effect’ is proposed. It is defined as: “the reduction of infection or disease in the unimmunised segment as a result of immunising a proportion of the population”. Herd immunity can be measured by testing a sample of the population for the presence of the chosen immune parameter. Herd effect can be measured by quantifying the decline in incidence in the unimmunised segment of a population in which an immunisation programme is instituted. Herd immunity applies to immunisation or infection, human to human transmitted or otherwise. On the other hand, herd effect applies to immunisation or other health interventions which reduce the probability of transmission, confined to infections transmitted human to human, directly or via vector. The induced herd immunity of a given vaccine exhibits geographic variation as it depends upon coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, both of which can vary geographically. Herd effect is determined by herd immunity as well as the force of transmission of the corresponding infection. Clear understanding of these phenomena and their relationships will help improve the design of effective and efficient immunisation programmes aimed at control, elimination or eradication of vaccine preventable infectious diseases.

  // “Herd Immunity”: A Rough Guide
  doi: https://doi.org/xyz
  ref 'Fine_et_al_2011
    head = Much of the early theoretical work on herd immunity assumed that vaccines induce solid immunity against infection and that populations mix at random, consistent with the simple herd immunity threshold for random vaccination of Vc = (1−1/R0), using the symbol Vc (Critical Vaccination Level) for the critical minimum proportion to be vaccinated (assuming 100% vaccine effectiveness).

    >>>
      The term “herd immunity” is widely used but carries a variety of meanings. Some authors use it to describe the proportion immune among individuals in a population. Others use it with reference to a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in incidence of infection. Still others use it to refer to a pattern of immunity that should protect a population from invasion of a new infection. A common implication of the term is that the risk of infection among susceptible individuals in a population is reduced by the presence and proximity of immune individuals (this is sometimes referred to as “indirect protection” or a “herd effect”). We provide brief historical, epidemiologic, theoretical, and pragmatic public health perspectives on this concept.

This average depends on how the various groups interact and can be calculated from a matrix describing how infection spreads within and between groups. Interactions are often observed to be more frequent within than between groups, in which case the most highly connected groups will dominate transmission, resulting in a higher value of R0, and a larger vaccination threshold than would be obtained by assuming that all individuals display average behavior.

The same effect is found in religious communities that eschew vaccination [28, 29]; though they form only a small proportion of the population, the fact that they often mix selectively with other members of the same community means that they are at an elevated risk of infection

Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels.

    >>> Abstract
      Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe is now experiencing large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact of these interventions across 11 European countries. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number – a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. One of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount of data across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by the data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain. We find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impact of interventions implemented several weeks earlier. In Italy, we estimate that the effective reproduction number, Rt, dropped to close to 1 around the time of lockdown (11th March), although with a high level of uncertainty. Overall, we estimate that countries have managed to reduce their reproduction number. Our estimates have wide credible intervals and contain 1 for countries that have implemented all interventions considered in our analysis. This means that the reproduction number may be above or below this value. With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March, we estimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March [95% credible interval 21,000-120,000]. Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. We estimate that, across all 11 countries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 28th March, representing between 1.88% and 11.43% of the population. The proportion of the population infected to date – the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germany and Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics. Given the lag of 2-3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can be observed in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be certain that recent interventions have been effective. If interventions in countries at earlier stages of their epidemic, such as Germany or the UK, are more or less effective than they were in the countries with advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improved or worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted would change accordingly. It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in cases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is slowing.

    let !c self assert = Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in each country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4.9% [1.9%-11%] with considerable variation between countries Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not close to herd immunity (~50-75% if R0 is 2-4). Further, with Rt values dropping substantially, the rate of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread rapidly should interventions be lifted.

    let !d self assert = We estimate that major non-pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact on the timevarying reproduction numbers in countries where there has been time to observe intervention effects on trends in deaths (Italy, Spain). If adherence in those countries has changed since that initial period, then our forecast of future deaths will be affected accordingly: increasing adherence over time will have resulted in fewer deaths and decreasing adherence in more deaths. Similarly, our estimates of the impact of interventions in other countries should be viewed with caution if the same interventions have achieved different levels of adherence than was initially the case in Italy and Spain.

    / March, 2020 - Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team
    let !e self assert = The counterfactual model for Italy suggests that despite mounting pressure on health systems, interventions have averted a health care catastrophe where the number of new deaths would have been 3.7 times higher (38,000 deaths averted) than currently observed. Even in the UK, much earlier in its epidemic, the recent interventions are forecasted to avert 370 total deaths up to 31 of March.

    head = We have considered a model of age-heterogeneous transmission and mitigation in a COVID-19-like epidemic, which is simple but also tied to current estimates of both disease parameters and U.S.-specific contact patterns. We find that age-targeted mitigations can have a dramatic effect both on mortality and ICU utilization.

    >>> Abstract
      We use a simple SIR-like epidemic model which integrates known age-contact patterns for the United States to model the effect of age-targeted mitigation strategies for a COVID-19-like epidemic. We find that, among strategies which end with population immunity, strict age-targeted mitigation strategies have the potential to greatly reduce mortalities and ICU utilization for natural parameter choices.

    >>> Abstract
      To study the two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 that interdict the transmission pathway for SARS and other respiratory infectious diseases. Two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 were pressed into wafers. One hundred microL 10(6) TCID50/mL SARS-CoV, 100 microL 10(6) PFU/mL recombinant baculovirus expressing hamster's prion protein (haPrP) protein and roughly 10(6) E. coli were slowly dropped onto the surfaces of the catalyst wafers and exposed for 5 and 20 min, respectively. After eluted from the surfaces of wafers, the infectivity of viruses and propagation of bacteria were measured. The expression of PrP protein was determined by Western blot. The morphological changes of bacteria were observed by electronic microscopy. After exposure to the catalysts surfaces for 5 and 20 min, the infectivity of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and baculovirus in Sf9 cells dropped down to a very low and undetectable level, and no colony was detected using bacteria culture method. The expression of haPrP protein reduced to 21.8% in the preparation of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus exposed for 5 min and was undetectable exposed for 20 min. Bacterial membranes seemed to be cracked and the cytoplasm seemed to be effluent from cell bodies. Exposures to the surfaces of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 destroy the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, baculovirus and E. coli. Inactivation ability of metal catalysts needs to interact with air, utilizing oxygen molecules in air. Efficiently killing viruses and bacteria on the surfaces of the two metal catalysts has a promising potential for air-disinfection in hospitals, communities, and households.

The clinical effect size warrants further consideration of this intervention as a component of a systems-based approach to control HAIs.

    >>> BACKGROUND
      Studies have consistently shown that copper alloyed surfaces decrease the burden of microorganisms in health care environments. This study assessed whether copper alloy surfaces decreased hospital-associated infections in pediatric intensive and intermediate care units.

    >>> METHODS
      Admitted infants were assigned sequentially to a room furnished with or without a limited number of copper alloyed surfaces. Clinical and exposure to intervention data were collected on a daily basis. To avoid counting infections present prior to admission, patients who stayed in the hospital <72 hours were excluded from analysis. Health care-associated infections (HAIs) were confirmed according to protocol definitions.

    >>> RESULTS
      Clinical outcomes from 515 patients were considered in our analysis: 261 patients from the intervention arm of the study, and 254 from the control arm. Crude analysis showed an HAI rate of 10.6 versus 13.0 per 1,000 patient days for copper- and non-copper-exposed patients, respectively, for a crude relative risk reduction (RRR) of 0.19 (90% confidence interval, 0.46 to -0.22). Conducting clinical trials to assess interventions that may impact HAI rates is very challenging. The results here contribute to our understanding and ability to estimate the effect size that copper alloy surfaces have on HAI acquisition.

    >>> CONCLUSIONS
      Exposure of pediatric patients to copper-surfaced objects in the closed environment of the intensive care unit resulted in decreased HAI rates when compared with noncopper exposure; however, the RRR was not statistically significant. The clinical effect size warrants further consideration of this intervention as a component of a systems-based approach to control HAIs.

    >>> Background
      There are indications that bacteria found on frequently touched environmental surfaces play a role in infection transmission.

      In laboratory testing, copper alloy samples were inoculated with bacteria. In clinical trials, the amount of live bacteria on the surfaces of hospital components made of copper alloys, as well as those made from standard materials, was measured. Finally, infection rates were tracked in the hospital rooms with the copper components and compared to those found in the rooms containing the standard components.

      Greater than a 99.9% reduction in live bacteria was realized in laboratory tests. In the clinical trials, an 83% reduction in bacteria was seen on the copper alloy components, when compared to the surfaces made from standard materials in the control rooms. Finally, the infection rates were found to be reduced by 58% in patient rooms with components made of copper, when compared to patients' rooms with components made of standard materials.

    >>> Abstract
      The evolution of new and reemerging historic virulent strains of respiratory viruses from animal reservoirs is a significant threat to human health. Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses that emerged in humans at the beginning of the 21st century. Both viruses likely originated in bats, and genetically diverse coronaviruses that are related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered in bats worldwide. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of these two pathogenic coronaviruses and discuss their receptor usage; we also highlight the diversity and potential of spillover of bat-borne coronaviruses, as evidenced by the recent spillover of swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) to pigs.

    >>> Summary
      An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely spread worldwide. Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et al. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. PangolinCoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the wholegenome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between PangolinCoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusively, this study suggests that pangolin species are a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs

    let !i self assert = Phylogenetic analysis based on the N protein supported the classification of Pangolin-CoV as a sister taxon of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 . We further found seven amino acid mutations that differentiated our defined “SAR-CoV-2 group” CoVs (12N, 26 G, 27S, 104D, 218A, 335T, 346N, and 350Q) from other known SARS-CoVs (12S, 26D, 27N, 104E, 218T, 335H, 346Q, and 350N). Two amino acid sites (38P and 268Q) are shared by Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13, and SARS-CoVs, which are mutated to 38S and 268A in SARS-CoV-2. Only one amino acid residue shared by Pangolin-CoV and other SARS-CoVs (129E) is consistently different in both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 (129D). The observed amino acid changes in the N protein would be useful for developing antigens with improved sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 serological detection.

The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.

    >>> Objective
      To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

    >>> Design, Setting, and Participants
      Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.

    >>> Exposures
      Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission.

      All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.

    >>> Conclusions and Relevance
      In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.

    >>> Abstract
      Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.

      Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating clinical condition associated with pulmonary and systemic inflammation and characterized by incompetence of the pulmonary microvascular barrier culminating in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying endothelial barrier dysfunction in ALI has been facilitated by study of the effects of statins in relevant cellular and animals models. Many of the pleotropic properties of these drugs, including direct effects on endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeletal rearrangement, NADPH oxidase, and nitric oxide activity, as well as effects on differential EC gene expression, are relevant to the pathobiology of ALI and suggest a potential therapeutic role for statins in this context. Moreover, results from preclinical studies and observations in relevant patient populations support the protective potential of statins in ALI, paving the way now for definitive clinical trials.

Statins appear to reduce the stability of lipid raft formation with subsequent effects on immune activation and regulation, and also prevent the prenylation of signalling molecules with subsequent downregulation of gene expression.

When present in adequate amounts in immunocytes and body fluids (especially in the alveolar fluid) may actually prevent these infections.

    >>> Abstract
      SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS are all enveloped viruses that can cause acute respiratory syndrome. Arachidonic acid (AA) and other unsaturated fatty acids (especially eicosapentaenoic acd, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA) are known to inactivate enveloped viruses and inhibit proliferation of various microbial organisms. The pro-inflammatory metabolites of AA and EPA such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes induce inflammation whereas lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from AA, EPA and DHA not only suppress inflammation but also enhance would healing and augment phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load. In view of these actions, it is suggested that AA and other unsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds and their deficiency may render humans susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS and other similar viruses’ infections. Hence, oral or intravenous administration of AA and other unsaturated fatty acids may aid in enhancing resistance and recovery from SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS infections.

      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to alleviate symptoms during community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), while neither clinical data nor guidelines encourage this use. Experimental data suggest that NSAIDs impair neutrophil intrinsic functions, their recruitment to the inflammatory site, and the resolution of inflammatory processes after acute pulmonary bacterial challenge. During CAP, numerous observational data collected in hospitalized children, hospitalized adults, and adults admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) support a strong association between pre-hospital NSAID exposure and a delayed hospital referral, a delayed administration of antibiotic therapy, and the occurrence of pleuropulmonary complications, even in the only study that has accounted for a protopathic bias. Other endpoints have been described including a longer duration of antibiotic therapy and a greater hospital length of stay. In all adult series, patients exposed to NSAIDs were younger and had fewer comorbidities. The mechanisms by which NSAID use would entail a complicated course in pneumonia still remain uncertain. The temporal hypothesis and the immunological hypothesis are the two main emerging hypotheses. Current data strongly support an association between NSAID intake during the outpatient treatment of CAP and a complicated course. This should encourage experts and scientific societies to strongly advise against the use of NSAIDs in the management of lower respiratory tract infections.

      Influenza viruses are a major pathogen of both humans and animals. Recent studies using gene-knockout mice have led to an in-depth understanding of the innate sensors that detect influenza virus infection in a variety of cell types. Signalling downstream of these sensors induces distinct sets of effector mechanisms that block virus replication and promote viral clearance by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we discuss the various ways in which the innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors to detect and respond to influenza virus infection. We consider whether the outcome of innate sensor stimulation promotes antiviral resistance or disease tolerance, and propose rational treatment strategies for the acute respiratory disease that is caused by influenza virus infection.

To understand the in vivo consequence, we used mice expressing a functional Mx gene encoding a major interferon-induced effector against IAV in humans. In Mx1-intact mice with weakened resistance due to deficiencies in Mavs and Tlr7, we found an elevated respiratory bacterial burden. Notably, mortality in the absence of Mavs and Tlr7 was independent of viral load or MyD88-dependent signaling but dependent on bacterial burden, caspase-1/11, and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. Therefore, in the context of weakened antiviral resistance, vulnerability to IAV disease is a function of caspase-dependent pathology.

Furthermore, expression of IRF7, a critical transcription factor for type I IFNs, and STAT1, a type I IFN receptor signaling molecule, was lower in the older cohort.

After challenge with a lower dose of A/PR8 virus (100 PFU), Tlr7–/–, Mavs–/–, and Casp1/11–/– mice were resistant, but Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– double-deficient mice lost weight and succumbed to infection

    head = This study shows that type III secretion system (T3SS) rod proteins or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces inflammasome activation, macrophage pyroptosis, and accompanying tissue factor release, directly connecting inflammation to coagulation.

    >>> Abstract
      Inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis are critical defense mechanisms against microbes. However, overactivation of inflammasome leads to death of the host. Although recent studies have uncovered the mechanism of pyroptosis following inflammasome activation, how pyroptotic cell death drives pathogenesis, eventually leading to death of the host, is unknown. Here, we identified inflammasome activation as a trigger for blood clotting through pyroptosis. We have shown that canonical inflammasome activation by the conserved type III secretion system (T3SS) rod proteins from Gram-negative bacteria or noncanonical inflammasome activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced systemic blood clotting and massive thrombosis in tissues. Following inflammasome activation, pyroptotic macrophages released tissue factor (TF), an essential initiator of coagulation cascades. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TF abolishes inflammasome-mediated blood clotting and protects against death. Our data reveal that blood clotting is the major cause of host death following inflammasome activation and demonstrate that inflammasome bridges inflammation with thrombosis.

Because pores formed by GSDMD facilitate the release of the IL-1b and IL-18 GSDMD deficiency not only prevents pyroptosis but also diminishes IL-1b and IL-18 secretion.

We found that deficiency of the receptors for IL-1b and IL-18 does not protect against EprJ-elicited coagulation. These data exclude the possibility that inflammasome-activation-induced coagulation requires IL-1b- and IL18-dependent inflammation, thus establishing pyroptosis as a key event leading to coagulation upon inflammasome activation.

Together, these data suggest that cell membrane fragments of pyroptotic macrophages form TF-positive MVs as a result of thermodynamics. This is consistent with previous findings that caspase-1 activation by ATP promotes TF-positive MV release in vitro.

    let !e self assert = Unlike IL-1b and IL-18, release of TF from macrophages is not through GSDMD pores but requires membrane rupture, suggesting distinct mechanisms are involved. This is not surprising because IL-1b and IL-18 are cytosolic proteins and TF is a transmembrane protein. Besides pyroptosis, necroptosis is another form of lytic programmed cell death. Although distinct signaling pathways induce pyroptosis and necroptosis, both forms of cell death lead to ruptured cell membrane, a requirement for TF-positive MV release. Thus, it is likely that necroptosis may also lead to TF release

    >>> Abstract
      The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak was caused by a coronavirus (CoV) named the SARS-CoV. SARS pathology is propagated both by direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and aberrant activation of the innate immune response. Here, we identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets the innate immune response. We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77. Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate. In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation. Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures. ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. While in those cells lacking NLRP3 accumulating ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-independent cell death.

Using reconstituted 293T cells and liposome-based analyses, we provide evidence that GSDMD pores serve as conduits for the transport of IL-1 family cytokines across intact lipid bilayers.

    >>> Abstract
      The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are cytosolic proteins that exhibit inflammatory activity upon release into the extracellular space. These factors are released following various cell death processes, with pyroptosis being a common mechanism. Recently, it was recognized that phagocytes can achieve a state of hyperactivation, which is defined by their ability to secrete IL-1 while retaining viability, yet it is unclear how IL-1 can be secreted from living cells. Herein, we report that the pyroptosis regulator gasdermin D (GSDMD) was necessary for IL-1β secretion from living macrophages that have been exposed to inflammasome activators, such as bacteria and their products or host-derived oxidized lipids. Cell- and liposome-based assays demonstrated that GSDMD pores were required for IL-1β transport across an intact lipid bilayer. These findings identify a non-pyroptotic function for GSDMD, and raise the possibility that GSDMD pores represent conduits for the secretion of cytosolic cytokines under conditions of cell hyperactivation.

    >>> Abstract
      BACKGROUND The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of global concern. Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity. METHODS We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 /L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly, lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease.

Inhibitors or knock-down methods carry the potential caveats of off target effects and incomplete inhibition at later time-points. For example, reduction of caspase-1 activity by 90 % could still result in the binary event of cell death after longer incubation periods.

    head = The SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytokine storm and lymphopenia, particularly a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, as well as suppressed IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells, which might be correlated with disease severity of COVID-19. These potential immunological markers may be of importance due to their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.

    >>> Background
      Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming a global threat. We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.

    >>> Results
      The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).

    >>> Conclusion
      The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.

It has since been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus, similar to SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus and named COVID-19. As of 8 February 2020, 33 738 confirmed cases and 811 deaths have been reported in China.
      Here we review the basic reproduction number (R0) of the COVID-19 virus. R0 is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally naïve population. For R0 > 1, the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 < 1, transmission is likely to die out. The basic reproduction number is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to epidemic spread.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104212
  ref 'Paraskevis_et_al_2020
    head = Our study rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event. Notably, the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. This genomic part comprises half of the spike region encoding a multifunctional protein responsible also for virus entry into host cells.

    >>> Background
      A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.

    >>> Methods
      Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

    >>> Results
      Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

    >>> Conclusions
      The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.

    >>> Abstract
      An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.006
  ref 'Xie_et_al_2018
    head =  Our data support that the S358 (highly conserved serine residue) replacement in bat STING dampened but did not fully diminish the functionality of STING. The nature of the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of “effective response” but not “over response” against viruses

    >>> Abstract
      Compared with terrestrial mammals, bats have a longer lifespan and greater capacity to co-exist with a variety of viruses. In addition to cytosolic DNA generated by these viral infections, the metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage and the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether bats have an altered DNA sensing/defense system to balance high cytosolic DNA levels remains an open question. We demonstrate that bats have a dampened interferon response due to the replacement of the highly conserved serine residue (S358) in STING, an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways. Reversing this mutation by introducing S358 restored STING functionality, resulting in interferon activation and virus inhibition. Combined with previous reports on bat-specific changes of other DNA sensors such as TLR9, IFI16, and AIM2, our findings shed light on bat adaptation to flight, their long lifespan, and their unique capacity to serve as a virus reservoir.

Instead, this residue has been replaced by a variety of different residues at this position, including N, H, F, Y, P, D, and R. As the S358 phosphorylation site is critical for downstream IFN activation in humans and other mammals (Liu et al., 2015, Tanaka and Chen, 2012, Tsuchida et al., 2010, Zhong et al., 2008), this key residue change strongly suggests a weakened bat STING in the context of IFN activation.

We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor κB pathways that may be related to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction of important gene families. Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian species has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution.

    >>> Abstract
      Bats are unique among mammals given their ability to fly, apparent tolerance of deadly viruses and extraordinary longevity. We propose that these traits are linked and driven by adaptations of the innate immune system. To explore this hypothesis we challenged macrophages from the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis and the house mouse, Mus musculus with toll like receptors (TLRs) ligands, lipopolysaccharides, LPS and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, Poly(I:C). Macrophages from both species presented a high level of mRNA induction of inferon β (INF-β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1β (Il-1β). However, in bat macrophages, this antiviral, proinflammatory response was balanced by a sustained high-level transcription of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-10, which was not observed in mouse, potentially resulting from adaptive regulation in bats. Additionally, phylogenomic selection tests across the basal divergences in mammals (n = 39) uncovered bat-specific adaptations in six genes involved in antiviral and proinflammatory signalling. Based on this pilot study, we put forward a hypothesis that bats may have evolved unique anti-inflammatory responses to neutralize proinflammatory stimuli resulting from flight. This in turn may drive their extraordinary longevity and viral tolerance by limiting inflammation driven ageing and infection-induced immunopathology. Further data from other individuals and bat species are required to advance this intriguing hypothesis.

    head = Results indicate that the unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.

    >>> Abstract
      Bats of different species play a major role in the emergence and transmission of highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola virus, SARS-like coronavirus and the henipaviruses. These viruses require proteolytic activation of surface envelope glycoproteins needed for entry, and cellular cathepsins have been shown to be involved in proteolysis of glycoproteins from these distinct virus families. Very little is currently known about the available proteases in bats. To determine whether the utilization of cathepsins by bat-borne viruses is related to the nature of proteases in their natural hosts, we examined proteolytic processing of several viral fusion proteins in cells derived from two fruit bat species, Pteropus alecto and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our work shows that fruit bat cells have homologs of cathepsin and furin proteases capable of cleaving and activating both the cathepsin-dependent Hendra virus F and the furin-dependent parainfluenza virus 5 F proteins. Sequence analysis comparing Pteropus alecto furin and cathepsin L to proteases from other mammalian species showed a high degree of conservation; however significant amino acid variation occurs at the C-terminus of Pteropus alecto furin. Further analysis of furin-like proteases from fruit bats revealed that these proteases are catalytically active and resemble other mammalian furins in their response to a potent furin inhibitor. However, kinetic analysis suggests that differences may exist in the cellular localization of furin between different species. Collectively, these results indicate that the unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.

    >>> Abstract
      A majority of viruses that have caused recent epidemics with high lethality rates in people, are zoonoses originating from wildlife. Among them are filoviruses (e.g., Marburg, Ebola), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), henipaviruses (e.g., Hendra, Nipah) which share the common features that they are all RNA viruses, and that a dysregulated immune response is an important contributor to the tissue damage and hence pathogenicity that results from infection in humans. Intriguingly, these viruses also all originate from bat reservoirs. Bats have been shown to have a greater mean viral richness than predicted by their phylogenetic distance from humans, their geographic range, or their presence in urban areas, suggesting other traits must explain why bats harbor a greater number of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signaling pathways. Do our life history traits make us susceptible to generating damaging immune responses to RNA viruses or does the physiology of bats make them particularly tolerant or resistant? Understanding what immune mechanisms enable bats to coexist with RNA viruses may provide critical fundamental insights into how to achieve greater resilience in humans.

    >>> Abstract
      Host interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are broad-spectrum antiviral restriction factors. Of these, IFITM3 potently inhibits viruses that enter cells through acidic endosomes, many of which are zoonotic and emerging viruses with bats (order Chiroptera) as their natural hosts. We previously demonstrated that microbat IFITM3 is antiviral. Here, we show that bat IFITMs are characterized by strong adaptive evolution and identify a highly variable and functionally important site—codon 70—within the conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs. Mutation of this residue in microbat IFITM3 impairs restriction of representatives of four different virus families that enter cells via endosomes. This mutant shows altered subcellular localization and reduced S-palmitoylation, a phenotype copied by mutation of conserved cysteine residues in microbat IFITM3. Furthermore, we show that microbat IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine residues C71, C72, and C105, mutation of each cysteine individually impairs virus restriction, and a triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant loses all restriction activity, concomitant with subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3 to Golgi-associated sites. Thus, we propose that S-palmitoylation is critical for Chiropteran IFITM3 function and identify a key molecular determinant of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation.

  // Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence
  doi: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48401
  ref 'Brook_et_al_2020
    head = We present general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.

    >>> Abstract
      Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses without experiencing disease. A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.

  ref 'Banerjee_et_al_2017
    head = Identifying unique defence mechanisms in bats might allow us to extend the knowledge for therapeutic purposes in spill-over hosts that often develop significant disease or succumb to infections with these viruses.

    >>> Abstract
      In recent years viruses similar to those that appear to cause no overt disease in bats have spilled-over to humans and other species causing serious disease. Since pathology in such diseases is often attributed to an over-active inflammatory response, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells respond to stimulation of their receptors for viral ligands with a strong antiviral response, but unlike in human cells, the inflammatory response is not overtly activated. We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNFα, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation. We examined the bat TNFα promoter and found a potential repressor (c-Rel) binding motif. We demonstrated that c-Rel binds to the putative c-Rel motif in the promoter and knocking down c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNFα transcripts. Our results suggest bats may have a unique mechanism to suppress inflammatory pathology.

    >>> Abstract
      The discovery of SARS-like coronavirus in bats suggests that bats could be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. However, previous studies indicated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a known SARS-CoV receptor, from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays. The results show that ACE2s of Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus support viral entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, albeit with different efficiency in comparison to that of the human ACE2. Further, the alteration of several key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ACE2 receptor efficiency, as predicted from a structural modeling study of the different bat ACE2 molecules. These data suggest that M. daubentoni and R. sinicus are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV and may be candidates as the natural host of the SARS-CoV progenitor viruses. Furthermore, our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ACE2 among bats is greater than that observed among known SARS-CoV susceptible mammals, highlighting the possibility that there are many more uncharacterized bat species that can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV or its progenitor viruses. This calls for continuation and expansion of field surveillance studies among different bat populations to eventually identify the true natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.

    head = The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.

    >>> Background
      In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.

    >>> Findings
      Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.

    >>> Interpretation
      The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

    >>> Objective
      To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) by stratifying the comorbidity status.

    >>> Methods
      We analysed the data from 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalised patients 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between December 11th, 2019 and January 31st, 2020. We analyse the composite endpoints, which consisted of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities.

    >>> Results
      The mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD [hazards ratio (HR) 2.681, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.424–5.048], diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03–2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07–2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60–7.64) were risk factors of reaching to the composite endpoints. The HR was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16–2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61–4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.

    >>> Conclusion
      Among laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.

    head = Patients with ESRD (end-stage renal disease) treated with dialysis have higher pulmonary infectious mortality rates compared with the GP (General Population), even after stratification for age, race, and DM (diabetes mellitus).

    >>> Background
      Infection is the second-leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This is due in part to advanced age, comorbid conditions, and immune dysfunction observed in uremic states. Although one may hypothesize that pulmonary infectious mortality is higher among patients with ESRD compared with the general population (GP), no such data are currently available.

    >>> Methods
      We compared annual pulmonary infectious mortality rates among patients with ESRD to those in the GP. The data were abstracted from the United States Renal Data System and the National Center for Health Statistics, respectively, and were stratified by age, gender, race, and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus (DM). In the GP, primary and multiple cause-of-death analyses were performed to account for potential limitations of the data sources.

    >>> Results
      Overall, pulmonary infectious mortality rate was 14-fold to 16-fold higher in dialysis patients and approximately twofold higher in renal transplant recipients compared with the GP. After stratification for age, differences between groups decreased but retained their magnitude.

    >>> Conclusion
      Patients with ESRD treated with dialysis have higher pulmonary infectious mortality rates compared with the GP, even after stratification for age, race, and DM. Consequently, this patient population must be considered at high risk for the development of lethal pulmonary infections.

      The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2–14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3–4 days without truncation and at 5–9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.

We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.

    >>>  Results
      Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).

      The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.

The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.

    >>> Abstract
      As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to emerge throughout China and threaten the globe, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain. Here, we analyze the serial intervals-the time period between the onset of symptoms in an index (infector) case and the onset of symptoms in a secondary (infectee) case-of 468 infector-infectee pairs with confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by health departments in 18 Chinese provinces between January 21, 2020, and February 8, 2020. The reported serial intervals range from -11 days to 20 days, with a mean of 3.96 days (95% confidence interval: 3.53-4.39), a standard deviation of 4.75 days (95% confidence interval: 4.46-5.07), and 12.6% of reports indicating pre-symptomatic transmission.

    head = This paper has combined published empirical data to provide estimates of the incubation period for nine important respiratory viruses.

    >>> Abstract
      Knowledge of the incubation period is essential in the investigation and control of infectious disease, but statements of incubation period are often poorly referenced, inconsistent, or based on limited data. In a systematic review of the literature on nine respiratory viral infections of public-health importance, we identified 436 articles with statements of incubation period and 38 with data for pooled analysis. We fitted a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 5·6 days (95% CI 4·8–6·3) for adenovirus, 3·2 days (95% CI 2·8–3·7) for human coronavirus, 4·0 days (95% CI 3·6–4·4) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 1·4 days (95% CI 1·3–1·5) for influenza A, 0·6 days (95% CI 0·5–0·6) for influenza B, 12·5 days (95% CI 11·8–13·3) for measles, 2·6 days (95% CI 2·1–3·1) for parainfluenza, 4·4 days (95% CI 3·9–4·9) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1·9 days (95% CI 1·4–2·4) for rhinovirus. When using the incubation period, it is important to consider its full distribution: the right tail for quarantine policy, the central regions for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning. Our estimates combine published data to give the detail necessary for these and other applications.

  // The reachability of contagion in temporal contact networks: how disease latency can exploit the rhythm of human behavior
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3117-6
  ref 'Colman_et_al_2018
    head = The rate of contact between individuals fluctuates periodically in time with the cycles of human social activity. The impact of infectious disease is maximized when timing of infectiousness is synchronized with these temporal dynamics.

    >>> Background
      The symptoms of many infectious diseases influence their host to withdraw from social activity limiting their potential to spread. Successful transmission therefore requires the onset of infectiousness to coincide with a time when the host is socially active. Since social activity and infectiousness are both temporal phenomena, we hypothesize that diseases are most pervasive when these two processes are synchronized.

    >>> Methods
      We consider disease dynamics that incorporate behavioral responses that effectively shorten the infectious period of the pathogen. Using data collected from face-to-face social interactions and synthetic contact networks constructed from empirical demographic data, we measure the reachability of this disease model and perform disease simulations over a range of latent period durations.

    >>> Results
      We find that maximum transmission risk results when the disease latent period (and thus the generation time) are synchronized with human circadian rhythms of 24 h, and minimum transmission risk when latent periods are out of phase with circadian rhythms by 12 h. The effect of this synchronization is present for a range of disease models with realistic disease parameters and host behavioral responses.

    >>> Conclusions
      The reproductive potential of pathogens is linked inextricably to the host social behavior required for transmission. We propose that future work should consider contact periodicity in models of disease dynamics, and suggest the possibility that disease control strategies may be designed to optimize against the effects of synchronization.

    head = In 1990 study of 15 volunteers who were deliberately infected with a different coronavirus squirted into their nose, with immunity monitored for a year. Immunity reached a maximum at 2 weeks. It had lapsed by a year later.

    >>> Summary
      After preliminary trials, the detailed changes in the concentration of specific circulating and local antibodies were followed in 15 volunteers inoculated with coronavirus 229E. Ten of them, who had significantly lower concentrations of pre-existing antibody than the rest, became infected and eight of these developed colds. A limited investigation of circulating lymphocyte populations showed some lymphocytopenia in infected volunteers. In this group, antibody concentrations started to increase 1 week after inoculation and reached a maximum about 1 week later. Thereafter antibody titres slowly declined. Although concentrations were still slightly raised 1 year later, this did not always prevent reinfection when volunteers were then challenged with the homologous virus. However, the period of virus shedding was shorter than before and none developed a cold. All of the uninfected group were infected on re-challenge although they also appeared to show some resistance to disease and in the extent of infection. These results are discussed with reference to natural infections with coronavirus and with other infections, such as rhinovirus infections.

Results from our assays suggest that antibodies mounted upon infection target the full length S protein as well as the RBD, which is the major target for neutralizing antibodies for related viruses coronaviruses.

    >>> Abstract
      SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) was first detected in China in late 2019 and has since then caused a global pandemic. While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general adult population as well as samples from COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that these assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as two days post COVID19 symptoms onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Such serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers may, in the future, also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.

    >>> Abstract
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.

      A seroepidemiologic study of infection by coronavirus strains 229E, OC38, OC43, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A-59, is described. In adults with upper respiratory disease, two “outbreaks” of coronavirus infection occurred, one during the winter of 1965–1966 associated with complement fixing (CF) antibody responses to OC38, OC43 and MHV, and the other during the following winter associated with CF antibody responses to 229E. In hospitalized children, infection with 229E was rare; infection with OC38, OC43, and MHV occurred less often in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract disease (3.5%) than in a control group with non-respiratory tract disease (8.2%). The limitations of the CF test using available coronavirus antigens are discussed.

    >>> Background
      Following the outbreaks of 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection, rapid influenza diagnostic tests have been used to detect H1N1 infection. However, no meta‐analysis has been undertaken to assess the diagnostic accuracy when this manuscript was drafted.

    >>> Methods
      The literature was systematically searched to identify studies that reported the performance of rapid tests. Random effects meta‐analyses were conducted to summarize the overall performance.

    >>> Results
      Seventeen studies were selected with 1879 cases and 3477 non‐cases. The overall sensitivity and specificity estimates of the rapid tests were 0·51 (95%CI: 0·41, 0·60) and 0·98 (95%CI: 0·94, 0·99). Studies reported heterogeneous sensitivity estimates, ranging from 0·11 to 0·88. If the prevalence was 30%, the overall positive and negative predictive values were 0·94 (95%CI: 0·85, 0·98) and 0·82 (95%CI: 0·79, 0·85). The overall specificities from different manufacturers were comparable, while there were some differences for the overall sensitivity estimates. BinaxNOW had a lower overall sensitivity of 0·39 (95%CI: 0·24, 0·57) compared with all the others (P‐value <0·001), whereas QuickVue had a higher overall sensitivity of 0·57 (95%CI: 0·50, 0·63) compared with all the others (P‐value = 0·005).

    >>> Abstract
      Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a variety of viruses and bacteria, which can be conveniently detected by multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). To compare the novel Luminex‐based NxTAG‐Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG‐RPP) with the routine multiplex‐ligation‐NAT based RespiFinder‐22® (RF‐22), 282 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs (71%), broncho‐alveolar lavage (27%), throat swabs, tracheal secretions, and sputum (2%) from 116 children and 155 adults were extracted using a Corbett CAS1200 (Qiagen), and analyzed in parallel by the routine RF‐22 and NxTAG‐RPP. Concordant results were obtained in 263 (93.3%) cases consisting of concordant positives in 167 (59.2%) and concordant negatives in 96 (34%). Results were discordant in 19 (6.7%) consisting of 15 positive:negative, and 4 negative:positive results by NxTAG‐RPP versus RF‐22, respectively. Co‐infections were observed in 10.3% with NxTAG‐RPP and in 5.9% with RF‐22. Most additional viral pathogens identified by the NxTAG‐RPP involved dual infections with rhinovirus and RSV. Discordant samples were mainly due to low genome signals of Ct less than 36, when retested by QNAT suggesting a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG‐RPP, also when detecting multiple infections. Hands‐on time after extraction for 24 and 96 samples was 0.25 and <0.5 hr for the NxTAG‐RPP, and 2 and 4 hr for the RF‐22, respectively. The median turn‐around time was 6 hr (range 5–7 hr) for NxTAG‐RPP and 12 hr (range 8–16 hr) for RF‐22. The NxTAG‐RPP showed comparable detection rates for most respiratory pathogens, while hands‐on and turn‐around time were considerably shorter. The clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses needs further clinical evaluation.

    >>> Objectives
      To provide a summary of evidence for the diagnostic accuracies of three multiplex PCR systems (mPCRs)—BioFire FilmArray RP (FilmArray), Nanosphere Verigene RV+ test (Verigene RV+) and Hologic Gen-Probe Prodesse assays—on the detection of viral respiratory infections.

    >>> Methods
      A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay.

    >>> Results
      Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+ (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848–0.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882–0.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871–0.985), respectively. The three mPCRs were comparable in terms of detection of FluA.

    >>> Conclusions
      Point estimates calculated from eligible studies showed that the three mPCRs (FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+) are highly accurate and may provide important diagnostic information for early identification of respiratory virus infections. In patients with low pretest probability for FluA, these three mPCRs can predict a low possibility of infection and may justify withholding empirical antiviral treatments.

Prospectively and retrospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens (n = 2,908) were evaluated by using the ePlex RP panel, with the bioMérieux/BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire RP) as the comparator method. Discordance analysis was performed by using target-specific PCRs and bidirectional sequencing. The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated by using reproducibility panels comprised of 6 pathogens. The overall agreement between the ePlex RP and BioFire RP results was >95% for all targets. Positive percent agreement with the BioFire RP result for viruses ranged from 85.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2% to 88.9%) to 95.1% (95% CI, 89.0% to 97.9%), while negative percent agreement values ranged from 99.5% (95% CI, 99.1% to 99.7%) to 99.8% (95% CI, 99.5% to 99.9%). Additional testing of discordant targets (12%; 349/2,908) confirmed the results of ePlex RP for 38% (131/349) of samples tested. Reproducibility was 100% for all targets tested, with the exception of adenovirus, for which reproducibilities were 91.6% at low virus concentrations and 100% at moderate virus concentrations. The ePlex RP panel offers a new, rapid, and sensitive “sample-to-answer” multiplex panel for the detection of the most common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens.

While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.

    >>> Rationale:
      Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is a major concern for clinicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with hypertension.
    >>> Objective:
      To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
    >>> Methods and Results:
      This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to nine hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. Unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (3.7% vs. 9.8%; P = 0.01). In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; P =0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared to use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01) in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
    >>> Conclusions:
      Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.

    head = ACE2-binding peptides can be used as specific inhibitors of SARS-CoV-S protein-mediated infection. Based on the results of neutralization experiments using anti-SARS-CoV antibody and anti-ACE2 antibody, we conclude that VSV-SARS-St19 infection of target cells is mediated by SARS-CoV-S protein. VSV-SARS-St19 will be useful not only for analysing the function of SARS-CoV-S protein and for developing safe and rapid methods of detecting neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV infection but also for screening of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-S protein-mediated infection.

Partial deletion of the SARS-CoV-S protein cytoplasmic domain allowed efficient incorporation into VSV particles and led to the generation of a pseudotype (VSV-SARS-St19) at high titre.

Although knowledge about the viability of SARS-CoV-2 is limited, the virus could remain viable in the environment for days, which could lead to faecal–oral transmission, as seen with severe acute respiratory virus CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV.2

  // Inflamm‐aging: An Evolutionary Perspective on Immunosenescence

  ref 'Franceschi_et_al_2006
    head = The beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.

    >>> Abstract
      In this paper we extend the “network theory of aging,” and we argue that a global reduction in the capacity to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status are major characteristics of the aging process. This phenomenon, which we will refer to as “inflamm‐aging,” is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. On the basis of evolutionary studies, we also argue that the immune and the stress responses are equivalent and that antigens are nothing other than particular types of stressors. We also propose to return macrophage to its rightful place as central actor not only in the inflammatory response and immunity, but also in the stress response. The rate of reaching the threshold of proinflammatory status over which diseases/disabilities ensue and the individual capacity to cope with and adapt to stressors are assumed to be complex traits with a genetic component. Finally, we argue that the persistence of inflammatory stimuli over time represents the biologic background (first hit) favoring the susceptibility to age‐related diseases/disabilities. A second hit (absence of robust gene variants and/or presence of frail gene variants) is likely necessary to develop overt organ‐specific age‐related diseases having an inflammatory pathogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Following this perspective, several paradoxes of healthy centenarians (increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and coagulation factors) are illustrated and explained. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.

    >>> Abstract
      The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system’s capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.

  // Aging is associated with a numerical and functional decline in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas myeloid dendritic cells are relatively unaltered in human peripheral blood
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2009.07.005
  ref 'Jing_et_al_2009
    head = Low-grade chronic inflammation in individuals that commonly occurs during aging can also dull the ability of the innate and adaptive immune responses.

    >>> Abstract
      Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells that initiate and regulate T-cell responses. In this study, the numbers and functional cytokine secretions of plasmacytoid and myeloid DC (pDC and mDC, respectively) in peripheral blood from young and elderly subjects were compared. Overall, pDC numbers in peripheral blood were lower in healthy elderly compared with healthy young subjects (p = 0.016). In response to influenza virus stimulation, isolated pDC from healthy elderly subjects secreted less interferon (IFN)–α compared with those from healthy young subjects. The decline in IFN-α secretion was associated with a reduced proportion of pDC that expressed Toll-like receptor–7 or Toll-like receptor-9. In contrast, there was little difference in the numbers and cytokine secretion function between healthy young and healthy elderly subjects (p = 0.82). However, in peripheral blood from frail elderly subjects, the numbers of mDC were severely depleted as compared with either healthy young or elderly subjects (p = 0.014 and 0.007, respectively). Thus, aging was associated with the numerical and functional decline in pDC, but not mDC, in healthy young versus elderly subject group comparisons, while declining health in the elderly can profoundly impact mDC negatively. Because of the importance of pDC for antiviral responses, the age-related changes in pDC likely contribute to the impaired immune response to viral infections in elderly persons, especially when combined with the mDC dysfunction occurring in those with compromised health.

  // Impaired Interferon Signaling in Dendritic Cells From Older Donors Infected In Vitro With West Nile Virus
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jir048
  ref 'Qian_et_al_2011
    head = Monocytes from older individuals produce less interferon in response to viral infection.

    >>> Abstract
      West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA flavivirus, causes significant human morbidity and mortality in the older population; thus, we investigated the effects of aging on infection with WNV in dendritic cells (DCs). We infected DCs with WNV in vitro and quantified cytokines and chemokines (type I IFN and CXCL10), pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I, and Toll-like receptors 3 and 7. The production of type I IFN was significantly lower in DCs from older donors, compared with younger donors. Although we observed no significant age-related difference in expression or nuclear translocation of signaling molecules in initial antiviral responses, DCs from older donors have diminished induction of late-phase responses (eg, STAT1, IRF7, and IRF1), suggesting defective regulation of type I IFN. Our results identify deficits in critical regulatory pathways in the antiviral response that may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to viral infections observed in aging.

      As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.

In the case of high vaccination coverage of 95% with 1% naturally immune and 4% seronegative individuals, assuming that 100 persons are infected with an average shedding of 200 g feces per day, our data indicate that with a population size of 37,000 and an average sewage volume per day of 2.18E7 liters, approximately 25 polioviruses could be detected in 1 liter of sewage.Due to the ability to detect these numbers of polioviruses in sewage, this scenario would lead to an informative environmental poliovirus surveillance system.

In the case of a larger study population and/or a wider studyarea, the sensitivity of environmental surveillance may drop below the detection limit due to excessive dilution.

Inflammatory cytokines can promote the activation of blood coagulation in many ways, and then promote the occurrence of VTE[12-14]. Sepsis is also a common cause of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)[15].And the incidence of DIC in dead NCP patients was 71.4%[3]. This suggested that abnormal blood coagulation and thrombosis were associated with poor prognosis in patients with NCP.

Therefore, D-dimer is often used to detect active thrombus with high sensitivity but low specificity[16]. But, if 3.0 µg/mL was used as the cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity and NPV were 76.9%, 94.9% and 92.5%, respectively. After receiving anticoagulant therapy, the level of D-dimer decreased gradually, which means that D-dimer can not only predict thrombosis but also monitor the effectiveness of anticoagulants.

This meant that older patients with more underlying diseases were more likely to develop immune dysfunction and have a higher risk of VTE because of their poor immunity.

    let !b self assert =  Vero E6 cells were treated with the various concentrations of niclosamide indicated, and an IFA was performed at 48 h postinfection. At concentrations of 3.12 μM and higher, niclosamide was able to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis. Thus, the effective concentration of niclosamide that inhibited 50% of viral antigen synthesis was estimated to be within the range of 1 to 3 μM.

    / July, 2004- Antimicrob Agents Chemotherapy
    let !e self assert = Since SARS-CoV is known to actively replicate in the intestinal tract, it is also important to evaluate whether niclosamide taken orally can inhibit viral replication and lower the viral load in the lumen of the intestine or in the stool. If viral replication in the intestine can be adequately inhibited by niclosamide, this drug might be considered for use in controlling the fecal-oral route that has been speculated to be one of the possible avenues of transmission. Given that profuse watery diarrhea is a common symptom and that SARS-CoV is shed in large quantities in the stools of SARS patients, niclosamide may therefore be appropriate for treatment.

    let !c self assert = In addition to attenuating the binding of Ang II to its AT1 receptors, the beneficial actions of ARB may be explained by two possible mechanisms: 1) the restored ACE2, normally decreased during the viral infection, helps reducing the concentrations of Ang II3 and, 2) there is an increased generation of the protective Ang- (1-7).

  ref 'Kim_et_al_2017
    head = The role of ACE inhibitor in the lungs is not well understood. We therefore conducted this study to elucidate the effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockage on the prognosis of patients with ARDS.

    >>> Results
      A total of 182 patients were included in the study. Thirty-seven patients (20.3%) took ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) during ICU admission, and 145 (79.7%) did not; both groups showed similar severity scores. In the ICU, mortality was 45.9% in the RAS inhibitor group and 58.6% in the non-RAS inhibitor group (P = 0.166). The RAS inhibitor group required a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (29.5 vs. 19.5, P = 0.013) and longer ICU stay (32.1 vs. 20.2 days, P < 0.001). In survival analysis, the RAS inhibitor group showed better survival rates than the non-RAS group (P < 0.001).

    let !b self assert = An interesting finding was that the ACE inhibitor group showed greater ICU stay duration and length of mechanical ventilation (mean, 34.2 days) than non-ACE inhibitor group (mean, 29.4 days; P = 0.481).. Previous studies that conducted survival analysis suggested that surviving patients stayed longer in the ICU [31,40,41]. This could explain the differences between the two groups. Considering that no differences in ICU-free day or ventilator-free day, longer duration of ICU or mechanical ventilation could not be affirmed as poor clinical outcome.

    let !c self assert = More patients in the RAS inhibitor group were transferred to general wards, supported by portable bi-level positive airway pressure ventilators (18.9% vs. 5.5%, P = 0.008). Considering the similar results in terms of PaO2/FiO2 ratio and radiologic improvement on discharge, higher dependence on the bi-level positive airway pressure ventilator might be mainly caused by muscle weakness.

Inhospital mortality was also higher in the non-RAS inhibitor group and the day 28 mortality in non-RAS inhibitor group was almost twice as high without statistical significance (18.9% vs. 35.2%, P = 0.058). In the propensity score matched cohort, in hospital mortality at day 28 was also higher in non-RAS inhibitor group (29.4%) than RAS inhibitor group (8.8%, P = 0.031).

    let !e self assert = Among the patients who died, the duration of ICU stay was longer (P = 0.001) in the RAS inhibitor group than in the non-RAS inhibitor group, which might explain the lower 28-day mortality rates. Survival analysis showed significantly better survival rates in the RAS inhibitor group.

Based on this, it can be postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI)

    >>> Abstract
      The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.

Inhalation of dry air causes epithelial damage, MCC impairment, and increased mucin production. Impaired ISG expression and tissue repair and increased viral burden and mortality after influenza virus infection have been proven in mice exposed to 7 days of low RH of10–20%. Devastating disease course following dry air exposure is mediated by inflammasome caspase activation.

Thermoneutral temperature housing potentiates antitumor immunity and GVHD onset in mice. In addition, a short daylight period and consequent deficiency of vitamin D impair nonspecific immune responses. In conclusion, the combination of low humidity, temperature, and sunlight may trigger an impairment of the local and systemic antiviral defense mechanisms, leading to the increased host susceptibility to the respiratory viruses in winter.

    let !i self assert = Collectively, we can begin to assemble the factors that promote viral spread and disease in the winter months for cold and influenza viruses. However, other respiratory virus infections peak in spring or summer. One of the possible explanations is the replication conflict among respiratory viruses. Co-infection of winter respiratory viruses and spring respiratory viruses in the animal model may provide insights into the unknown mechanisms of spring-to-summer epidemics.

Thus, in addition to temperature, lighting, and humidity, there may be other environmental factors controlled by the seasons that contribute to higher levels of influenza virus infections in the winter months.

    let !k self assert = In addition to vaccines and antiviral drugs, nonpharmaceutical interventions to prevent respiratory infections are gaining attention. Lifestyle (eating healthy, sleeping more than 7 h/day) and hygiene practices (washing hands, wearing facemasks) are known to increase antimicrobial resistance and prevent transmission, respectively (118–121). In addition to these measures, we might consider controlling the indoor environment to combat respiratory infections.

      A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.

      Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection”. The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.

  // Trained immunity: A program of innate immune memory in health and disease
  doi: http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf1098
  ref 'Netea_et_al_2016
    head = We reappraised the various arguments pointing to the presence of innate immune memory in plants, lower animals, and vertebrates. We defined trained immunity as a nonspecific immunological memory resulting from rewiring the epigenetic program and the functional state of the innate immune system, eventually resulting in protection against secondary infections. We also compared data assessing the mechanisms of tolerance and trained immunity.

    >>> Abstract
      The general view that only adaptive immunity can build immunological memory has recently been challenged. In organisms lacking adaptive immunity, as well as in mammals, the innate immune system can mount resistance to reinfection, a phenomenon termed “trained immunity” or “innate immune memory.” Trained immunity is orchestrated by epigenetic reprogramming, broadly defined as sustained changes in gene expression and cell physiology that do not involve permanent genetic changes such as mutations and recombination, which are essential for adaptive immunity. The discovery of trained immunity may open the door for novel vaccine approaches, new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of immune deficiency states, and modulation of exaggerated inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases.

    >>> Abstract
      Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation6 to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2–3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40–50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.

    >>> Abstract
      Antibiotic-resistant organisms, an increasing source of morbidity and mortality, have a natural reservoir in hospitals, and recent estimates suggest that almost 2 million people develop hospital-acquired infections each year in the US alone. We investigate the temporal network of transfers of Medicare patients across US hospitals over a 2-year period to learn about the possible role of hospital-to-hospital transfers of patients in the spread of infections. We analyze temporal, geographical, and topological properties of the transfer network and show that this network may serve as a substrate for the spread of infections. Finally, we study different strategies for the early detection of incipient epidemics on the temporal transfer network as a function of activation time of a subset of sensor hospitals. We find that using approximately 2% of hospitals as sensors, chosen based on their network in-degree, with an activation time of 7 days results in optimal performance for this early warning system, enabling the early detection of 80% of the C. difficile. cases with the hospitals in the sensor set activated for only a fraction of 40% of the time.

    >>> Abstract
      Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a substantial source of morbidity and mortality and have a common reservoir in inpatient settings. Transferring patients between facilities could be a mechanism for the spread of these infections. We wanted to assess whether a network of hospitals, linked by inpatient transfers, contributes to the spread of nosocomial infections and investigate how network structure may be leveraged to design efficient surveillance systems. We construct a network defined by the transfer of Medicare patients across US inpatient facilities using a 100% sample of inpatient discharge claims from 2006–2007. We show the association between network structure and C. difficile incidence, with a 1% increase in a facility’s C. difficile incidence being associated with a 0.53% increase in C. difficile incidence of neighboring facilities. Finally, we used network science methods to determine the facilities to monitor to maximize surveillance efficiency. An optimal surveillance strategy for selecting “sensor” hospitals, based on their network position, detects 80% of the C. difficile infections using only 2% of hospitals as sensors. Selecting a small fraction of facilities as “sensors” could be a cost-effective mechanism to monitor emerging nosocomial infections.

      Numerous models explore how a wide variety of biological and social phenomena spread in social networks.

We apply the model to unique time series data collected during the 2009 H1N1 epidemic that includes information about vaccination, flu, and face-to-face social networks. The results show that well-connected individuals are more likely to get vaccinated, as are people who are exposed to friends who get vaccinated or are exposed to friends who get the flu. Our dueling contagion model suggests that other epidemiological models may be dramatically underestimating the R0 of contagions. It also suggests that the rate of vaccination contagion may be even more important than the biological contagion in determining the course of the disease. These results suggest that real world and online platforms that make it easier to see when friends have been vaccinated (personalized vaccination campaigns) and when they get the flu (personalized flu warnings) could have a large impact on reducing the severity of epidemics. They also suggest possible benefits from understanding the coevolution of many kinds of dueling contagions.

    head = This study describe methods that can be used to provide early detection of outbreaks and it could also be used to monitor targeted populations of any size, in real time.

    >>> Abstract
      Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best. It is known that individuals near the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner during the course of an outbreak, on average, than those at the periphery. Unfortunately, mapping a whole network to identify central individuals who might be monitored for infection is typically very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely, simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students who were either members of a group of randomly chosen individuals or a group of their friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95% C.I. 9.9–16.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16 of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance. The amount of lead time will depend on features of the outbreak and the network at hand. The method could in principle be generalized to other biological, psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

    >>> Abstract
      As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses.

    >>> Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly, highlighting the urgent need for an efficient approach to rapidly develop therapeutics and prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2. We describe here the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naïve CDRs into framework regions of an identified human germline IGHV allele. This enabled the isolation of high-affinity single-domain antibodies of fully human origin. The panning using SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 as antigens resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five types of neutralizing or non-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These fully human single-domain antibodies bound specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of them were found to potently neutralize pseudotyped and live virus, and therefore may represent promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19. This study also reports unique immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which may have important implications for the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Abstract
      The remarkable capacity of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their ability to generate de novo diversity in a short period of time. Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate. Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases. Our current knowledge of viral mutation rates indicates that viral genetic diversity is determined by multiple virus- and host-dependent processes, and that viral mutation rates can evolve in response to specific selective pressures.

    >>> Conclusion
      Viral mutation rates are determined by multiple processes, including polymerase intrinsic fidelity, replication mode, 3′ exonuclease activity, spontaneous nucleic acid damage, access to post-replicative repair, editing by host-encoded deaminases, imbalances in nucleotide pools, template sequence context, and template structure, as summarized in Table 2. Some of these processes underlie large-scale patterns of variation among viruses, such as differences between RNA and DNA viruses, between viruses with small and large genomes, and between single-strand and double-strand viruses, but important mechanistic aspects behind these differences still remain uncharacterized. Furthermore, mutation rates are not static and can evolve in response to selective pressures, as exemplified by fidelity variants selected under mutagenic conditions in a variety of viruses. In addition to polymerase fidelity, other mutation rate-determinants such as access to DNA repair may have also changed in response to selective pressures during viral evolution.
      In RNA viruses, both low- and high-fidelity polymerase variants tend to have a negative impact in viral fitness in complex environments, suggesting that RNA virus mutation rates have been evolutionarily optimized. Given that DNA virus mutation rates are substantially lower than those of RNA viruses this also suggests that DNA viruses show suboptimal mutation rates for adaptation to rapidly changing environments, despite RNA and DNA viruses sharing similar lifestyles. It appears that large DNA viruses have adopted a different and more elaborate strategy consisting of targeting mutations to specific genome regions subject to rapidly varying selective pressures, such as genes encoding attachment proteins or inhibitors of innate immunity responses. Mutation targeting mechanisms such as DGRs and recombination-driven gene copy amplification are probably not accessible to small DNA viruses with compact genomes. Furthermore, mutation rate evolution in small DNA viruses is further constrained by the fact they do not encode autonomous replication systems. Therefore, small DNA viruses should rely on repair avoidance and on use of host-encoded error-prone DNA polymerases to elevate their mutation rates and achieve faster adaptation. Elucidating the mutational mechanisms of small DNA viruses is a current challenge in virus molecular biology and evolution. Other exciting unresolved questions include unveiling the interplays between mutation and recombination, the roles played by viral accessory proteins in determining mutation rates, the effects of host-encoding enzymes on viral diversity and evolution, whether mutation accumulation can be evolutionary adjusted by modifying viral replication modes, and how template sequences regulate viral mutation rates.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) continuously threaten human health. However, to date, the evolutionary mechanisms that govern CoV strain persistence in human populations have not been fully understood. In this study, we characterized the evolution of the major antigen-spike (S) gene in the most prevalent human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. Among the five known HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to E), higher substitution rates and dN/dS values as well as more positive selection sites were detected in the S gene of genotype D, corresponding to the most dominant HCoV epidemic in recent years. Further analysis showed that the majority of substitutions were located in the S1 subunit. Among them, seven positive selection sites were chronologically traced in the temporal evolution routes of genotype D and six were located around the critical sugar binding region in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, an important sugar binding domain of CoV. These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.

    >>> Abstract
      Background. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

    >>> Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly infectious, with multiple possible routes of transmission. Controversy exists regarding whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in utero from an infected mother to her infant before birth. A series of 9 pregnant women found no mother-child transmission. We report a newborn with elevated IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 born to a mother with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

    >>> Discussion
      A neonate born to a mother with COVID-19 had elevated antibody levels and abnormal cytokine test results 2 hours after birth. The elevated IgM antibody level suggests that the neonate was infected in utero. IgM antibodies are not transferred to the fetus via the placenta.2 The infant potentially could have been exposed for 23 days from the time of the mother’s diagnosis of COVID-19 to delivery. The laboratory results displaying inflammation and liver injury indirectly support the possibility of vertical transmission. Although infection at delivery cannot be ruled out, IgM antibodies usually do not appear until 3 to 7 days after infection, and the elevated IgM in the neonate was evident in a blood sample drawn 2 hours after birth. Also, the mother’s vaginal secretions were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infant’s repeatedly negative RT-PCR test results on nasopharyngeal swabs are difficult to explain, although these tests are not always positive with infection. IgG antibodies can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta and appear later than IgM. Therefore, the elevated IgG level may reflect maternal or infant infection.
      Limitations of this report include the single case and that no PCR testing of amniotic fluid or placenta was performed. Additional examination of maternal and newborn samples should be done to confirm this preliminary observation.

    head = In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses. Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.

A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.9–2.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naïve confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557 = 4.5%) and the approximator of deaths/deaths + recoveries (2,169/2,169 + 17,572 = 11%) as of 29 February 2020.

      Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control.

    >>> Methods
      The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk.

    >>> Findings
      Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days.

    >>> Interpretation
      Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global health emergency. An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro), due to its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the X-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and its complex with an α-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. Based on the structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.

    >>> Abstract
      The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued a structure-based design of peptidomimetic α-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease–inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the α-ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.

    >>> Abstract
      Chloroquine is a 9-aminoquinoline known since 1934. Apart from its well-known antimalarial effects, the drug has interesting biochemical properties that might be applied against some viral infections. Chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Its best-studied effects are those against HIV replication, which are being tested in clinical trials. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 6, which mediate the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. We review the available information on the effects of chloroquine on viral infections, raising the question of whether this old drug may experience a revival in the clinical management of viral diseases such as AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which afflict mankind in the era of globalisation.

    head = We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems.

    >>> Abstract
      Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.

    >>> Abstract
      Background: The Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city on 23rd January 2020 to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Method: We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate (≥85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. Conclusion: The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.

    >>> Abstract
      There are limited data on the use of masks and respirators to reduce transmission of influenza. A systematic review was undertaken to help inform pandemic influenza guidance in the United Kingdom. The initial review was performed in November 2009 and updated in June 2010 and January 2011. Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials and quasi‐experimental and observational studies of humans published in English with an outcome of laboratory‐confirmed or clinically‐diagnosed influenza and other viral respiratory infections. There were 17 eligible studies. Six of eight randomised controlled trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups (masks with or without hand hygiene; N95/P2 respirators). One household trial found that mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza‐like illness/laboratory‐confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction. One hospital‐based trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with non‐fit‐tested N95 respirator use compared with medical masks. Eight of nine retrospective observational studies found that mask and/or respirator use was independently associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Findings, however, may not be applicable to influenza and many studies were suboptimal. None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection. Some evidence suggests that mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection especially hand hygiene. The effectiveness of masks and respirators is likely linked to early, consistent and correct usage.

    >>> Abstract
      On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) a pandemic. With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%. We can conclude from our model that, if worn properly, facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.

    >>> Abstract
      Outbreaks of influenza represent an important health concern worldwide. In many cases, vaccines are only partially successful in reducing the infection rate, and respiratory protective devices (RPDs) are used as a complementary countermeasure. In devising a protection strategy against influenza for a given population, estimates of the level of protection afforded by different RPDs is valuable. In this article, a risk assessment model previously developed in general form was used to estimate the effectiveness of different types of protective equipment in reducing the rate of infection in an influenza outbreak. It was found that a 50% compliance in donning the device resulted in a significant (at least 50% prevalence and 20% cumulative incidence) reduction in risk for fitted and unfitted N95 respirators, high‐filtration surgical masks, and both low‐filtration and high‐filtration pediatric masks. An 80% compliance rate essentially eliminated the influenza outbreak. The results of the present study, as well as the application of the model to related influenza scenarios, are potentially useful to public health officials in decisions involving resource allocation or education strategies.

    >>> Abstract
      Background: COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels. Results: We first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. Conclusions: Through building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.

    # >>> Conclusions
    #   Most notably, our analyses revealed that ACE2 expression levels are particularly high in cats and dogs. Especially in cats, expression levels in top four ACE2 expression hotspot tissues are all magnitudes higher than any other mammals examined. Intriguingly, in the ACE2 phylogenic tree, both cats and dogs are also cluster closer to humans than other mammals, suggesting potentially higher affinity to coronaviruses in these pets. SARS-CoV is known to infect cats, while SARS-CoV-2 positive cats and dogs had also been reported, therefore our analyses suggest high possibility that cats and dogs can host SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, in both cats and dogs, skin had high abundant ACE2 expression, so did ear tip in cats and retina in dogs. High ACE2 expression levels in these exterior body parts makes them particularly likely to host SARS-CoV-2 and pass on to humans via skin to skin contact. Stray animals can even be more serious transmitters of coronaviruses. It is estimated that there are approximately 500 million stray dogs and similar number of stray cats worldwide. Cats and dogs are sometimes slaughtered for meat, including a large proportion of stray ones. Therefore, it is likely that cats and dogs may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the least, people should also be vigilant with handling of pets in the effort of containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

      The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.

    >>> Abstract
      Bats harbor many viruses asymptomatically, including several notorious for causing extreme virulence in humans. To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.

    >>> Abstract
      In recent years, viruses similar to those that cause serious disease in humans and other mammals have been detected in apparently healthy bats. These include filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses that cause severe diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Marburg haemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The evolution of flight in bats seem to have selected for a unique set of antiviral immune responses that control virus propagation, while limiting self-damaging inflammatory responses. Here, we summarize our current understanding of antiviral immune responses in bats and discuss their ability to co-exist with emerging viruses that cause serious disease in other mammals. We highlight how this knowledge may help us to predict viral spillovers into new hosts and discuss future directions for the field.

    >>> Abstract
      The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines (‘lock-downs’) that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.

    >>> Abstract
      The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 600,000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world. However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.

Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries. Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS–CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses. We show, however, that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for recombination are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineages and that recombination is unlikely to explain the appearance of SARS in humans.

Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing.

      As a novel coronavirus first reported by Saudi Arabia in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is responsible for an acute human respiratory syndrome. The virus, of 2C beta-CoV lineage, expresses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and is densely endemic in dromedary camels of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is zoonotic but human-to-human transmission is also possible. Surveillance and phylogenetic researches indicate MERS-CoV to be closely associated with bats’ coronaviruses, suggesting bats as reservoirs, although unconfirmed. With no vaccine currently available for MERS-CoV nor approved prophylactics, its global spread to over 25 countries with high fatalities highlights its role as ongoing public health threat. An articulated action plan ought to be taken, preferably from a One Health perspective, for appropriately advanced countermeasures against MERS-CoV.

    >>> Abstract
      Shortly after its emergence in southern China in 2002/2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was confirmed to be the cause of SARS. Subsequently, SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) were found in palm civets from live animal markets in Guangdong and in various horseshoe bat species, which were believed to be the ultimate reservoir of SARSr-CoV. Till November 2018, 339 SARSr-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 274 from human, 18 from civets and 47 from bats [mostly from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), n = 30; and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), n = 9]. The human SARS-CoVs and civet SARSr-CoVs were collected in 2003/2004, while bat SARSr-CoVs were continuously isolated in the past 13 years even after the cessation of the SARS epidemic. SARSr-CoVs belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage B) of genus Betacoronavirus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position. Overall, it is observed that the SARSr-CoV genomes from bats in Yunnan province of China possess the highest nucleotide identity to those from civets. It is evident from both multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular SARSr-CoV from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nucleotide identity to the corresponding genes of SARSr-CoV from human/civets, resulting in the shift of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees. Our current model on the origin of SARS is that the human SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic in 2002/2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARSr-CoV ancestors in different horseshoe bat species.

    >>> Abstract
      Bats are a unique group of mammals of the order Chiroptera. They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat–animal and bat–human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.

      To help reveal the diversity and evolution of bat coronaviruses we collected 1067 bats from 21 species in China.

All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Overall, these data suggest that high contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of coronaviruses.

      In this review, we summarize the researches on animal reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Masked palm civets were suspected as the origin of the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was confirmed as the direct origin of SARS cases with mild symptom in 2004. Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human SARS-CoV with nt identity over 99.6%, indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time. Alignment of 10 complete viral genome sequences from masked palm civets with those of human SARS-CoVs revealed 26 conserved single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the viruses from masked palm civets. These conserved SNVs were gradually lost from the genomes of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 SARS epidemic. In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as the natural reservoir of a group of coronaviruses that are distantly related to SARS-CoV. The genome sequences of bat SARS-like coronavirus had about 88–92% nt identity with that of the SARS-CoV. The prevalence of antibodies and viral RNA in different bat species and the characteristics of the bat SARS-like coronavirus were elucidated. Apart from masked palm civets and bats, 29 other animal species had been tested for the SARS-CoV, and the results are summarized in this paper.

      The four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children. While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century. New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.

      Coronaviruses are found in a diverse array of bat and bird species, which are believed to act as natural hosts. Molecular clock dating analyses of coronaviruses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of these viruses existed around 10,000 years ago. This relatively young age is in sharp contrast to the ancient evolutionary history of their putative natural hosts, which began diversifying tens of millions of years ago. Here, we attempted to resolve this discrepancy by applying more realistic evolutionary models that have previously revealed the ancient evolutionary history of other RNA viruses. By explicitly modeling variation in the strength of natural selection over time and thereby improving the modeling of substitution saturation, we found that the time to the most recent ancestor common for all coronaviruses is likely far greater (millions of years) than the previously inferred range.

    >>> Abstract
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the x-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and its complex with an α-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. On the basis of the unliganded structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.

    >>> Abstract
      The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.

    >>> Abstract
      Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.
