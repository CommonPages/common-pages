  # Host range, bats, origin
  // Exceptional diversity and selection pressure on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 host receptor in bats compared to other mammals

    head = We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While its in a smaller proportion in non-bat mammals without enrichment of selection in residues.

    >>> Abstract
      Pandemics originating from pathogen transmission between animals and humans highlight the broader need to understand how natural hosts have evolved in response to emerging human pathogens and which groups may be susceptible to infection. Here, we investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains.

    let !a self assert = Mammals, particularly bats, are diverse at ACE2 contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS62 CoV-2: In bats (N=96), we found a minimum of 64 unique amino acid sequences across the 24 amino acids and 49 across the 7 amino acids, while in other mammals (N=111), we found a minimum of 68 unique amino acid sequences across the 24 amino acids and 38 across the 7 amino acids.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !b self assert = Within species for which we were able to observe multiple individuals, we observed differing levels of diversity in the 24 sites with Bos indicus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Camelus dromedarius and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum identical within species across individuals and sites; Canis lupus showed one amino acid difference across two individuals; in contrast all four individuals of Rhinolophus sinicus were different from one another.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !c self assert = Of the 22 sites with more than one amino acid, bats were more diverse than other mammals at 13 and were more even at 15. That bats demonstrate a similar diversity in their ACE2 across these loci and greater diversity in some sites than that observed across the rest of mammals suggests they may be particularly diverse in their ACE2, and supports the idea that bats are more diverse than other suspected SARS-CoV and SARSlike CoV hosts.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !d self assert = There is some evidence that the locus is evolving in response to coronaviruses; this is similar to the finding of strong selection in aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) in response to coronaviruses in mammals. However, this pattern is driven by and strengthened in bats; in bats a greater proportion of residues that contact SARS-CoV (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.03; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02) and SARS-CoV-2 (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.0004) were under selection than other residues in the gene, whereas residues that contact SARS-CoV (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.5; Table S3) or SARS-CoV-2 (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.5;) were not more likely to be under selection in non-bat mammals.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !e self assert = Because our dataset of bat sequences is smaller than our mammalian dataset, it further strengthens our conclusion that bats are under positive selection in contact residues. Across all mammals, positions 24 and 42 were under selection (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05), but in bats positions 27, 31, 35 and 354 (5 trees, MEME, p <0.05) and 30, 38, 329 and 393 (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.1) were additionally under positive selection while positions 45 (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05) and 353 (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.1) were under selection in non-bat mammals but not bats.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !f self assert = Both bats (pall trees < 0.002) and Rhinolophidae (pall trees < 0.00007) are under positive selection in ACE2. When we conducted an adaptive branch-site test of positive selection on all branches without specifying a foreground branch, branches in the bat clade were more likely to be selected than branches in other parts of the mammalian phylogeny (Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.05) and the branch at the base of Rhinolophidae was under positive selection.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !g self assert = When we removed the bat sequences we generated and examined the remaining terminal branches, a greater proportion of bat branches were under selection than non-bat branches, but statistical significance was lost, likely due to reduced power. Increased positive selection in bats in ACE2 compared with other mammals is consistent with their status as rich hosts of coronaviruses. Host diversity of bats in a region is associated with higher richness of coronaviruses; the diversity of bat ACE2 is consistent with the idea that a diversity of bats and their ACE2 sequences are coevolving with a diversity of viruses.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !h self assert = We found evidence that Rhinolophidae are under selection in ACE2, we found widespread selection across bats. Branches in the rhinolophid/ hipposiderid clade were not more likely to be under selection than other branches within bats (Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.7; Table S4) and bat lineages that live outside the predicted range of these viruses (e.g. in the Americas5 148 ) are also under positive selection. Therefore, there are still aspects of the bat-coronavirus relationship that we do not fully understand.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !i self assert = We found some evidence for increased selection in the residues that contact this virus in bats (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.07; MEME p < 0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.08), but not in non-bat mammals (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.6; MEME p < 0.1,Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4).

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !j self assert = Our finding of selection in residues that contact HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 contrasts with the findings of a smaller dataset of bats mostly from Europe, Asia and Africa and may result from our greater power to detect signal or signal originating from bats in different regions than previously tested. ACE2 regulation is known to impact survival in some influenza A infections ; New World bats are known to host many influenza A viruses, so it is possible the selection we detect could result from infection from non-coronavirus infections. Still, our results raise questions about whether there are or were SARS-related coronaviruses in these regions that have not been detected?

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !k self assert = Similarity of ACE2 yields predictions of susceptible hosts but cannot completely determine host range of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: All of the apes and most of the Old World monkeys we examined were identical to humans across all amino acid sites; those that were not identical differed by only 1 or 2 amino acids. However, amino acid similarity in these sites across different species often diverged from what we would have predicted from phylogeny alone.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !l self assert = Notably, two rodents (Mesocricetus auratus and Peromyscus leucopus) had identical or very similar amino acids to humans in all but 2 sites for each virus, and many artiodactyls (e.g. cows, deer, sheep, goats), cetaceans, cats, and pangolin were as similar or more similar to humans than New World monkeys both in residues that contact SARS-CoV and in residues that contact SARS-CoV-2. The civet fell in the middle of mammals in its similarity to humans in residues that contact either or both viruses

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !m self assert = In general, bats were not very similar to humans at these 24 amino acid sites, some with as many as five changes that would likely reduce virus binding, the most observed across mammals. Additionally, most bat sequences (56 of 91) showed that at least one of the two salt bridges (Lys31-Glu35; Asp38-Lys353 188 in humans) within ACE2 would be disrupted by changing a charged amino acid to an uncharged amino acid or to an amino acid with a clashing charge. In Rhinolophidae, only one sequence of the ten examined did not have a change in position 31 or 35 that would result in a clash between two positively charged amino acids.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !n self assert = However, bats (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001) and carnivores (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0004), particularly mustelids including ferrets, were more similar to humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV-2 than residues that contact SARS-CoV.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !o self assert = In our analysis, domestic cats were among the species most similar humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, cats can become infected and can shed both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !p self assert = Pangolins were as similar in their ACE2 residues to humans as cats, lending some support for the idea that a virus that can bind pangolin ACE2 might be able to transmit to humans.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !q self assert = Accordingly, it seems prudent to exercise precautions when interacting with species whose ACE2 is similar to humans in the contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, especially domestic animals such as cats, cows, goats and sheep. Care should also be taken with wild animals; for example, interactions between people with macaques or visitation of mountain gorillas by tourists could lead to cross-species transmission, endangering the health of humans and wildlife.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !r self assert = We predict this same glycosylated Asn is also present in some rhinolophid bats (R. ferrumequinum and some R. sinicus), though not all (R. pusillus, R. macrotis and some R. sinicus). Additionally, intraspecies variation could be an important component of reservoir competency that we are unable to assess. It is likely that not all individuals in a species are equally susceptible to infection, complicating the identification of reservoirs.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !s self assert = Spillover potential is not regulated solely by ACE2 sequence and sometimes SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 are able to replicate in hosts with divergent ACE2. Compatibility of the host protease with the virus is important for determining host range and viral strains vary in their binding properties to different species, with some SARS-like coronaviruses able to bind human, civet and rhinolophid ACE2, despite major ACE2 sequence differences between the species. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated well in ferrets, whose ACE2 ranked among the least similar to humans in their contact residues for SARS-CoV, though more similar for SARS-CoV-2. And species whose ACE2 sequence is not very similar to humans can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV.

    head = We utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.

    >>> Abstract
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.

    let !d self assert = Comparison of vertebrate ACE2 sequences and their predicted ability to bind SARS-CoV-2: The 18 species predicted as very high were all Old World primates and apes completely identical to human across the 25 ACE2 binding residues. The ACE2 proteins of 28 species were classified as having a high likelihood of binding the S RBD. Among them are twelve cetaceans, seven rodents, three cervids (deer), three lemuriform primates, two representatives of the order Pilosa (Giant anteater and Southern tamandua), and one Old World primate.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !e self assert = Fifty-seven species scored as medium for the ability of their ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV-2 S. Like the high score, this category has at least 20/25 residues identical to human ACE2 but more relaxed constraints for critical binding residues. All species with medium score are mammals distributed across six orders.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !f self assert = Among Carnivora, 9/43 scored medium, 9/43 scored low, and 25/43 scored very low. The carnivores scoring medium were only felids, including the domestic cat and Siberian tiger. Among the 13 Primates scoring medium there were 10 New World primates and three lemurs. Of 45 Rodentia species, 11 scored medium. Twenty-one Artiodactyls scored medium, including several important wild and domesticated ruminants, such as domesticated cattle, bison, sheep, goat, water buffalo, Masai giraffe, and Tibetan antelope. Species scoring medium also included 2/3 Lagomorphs and one Cetacean (sperm whale.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !g self assert = All chiropterans (bats) scored low (N=8) or very low (N=29), including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), from which a coronavirus very similar to SARS-CoV-2 was identified. Only 7.7% (3/39) primate species’ ACE2 scored low or very low, and 61% of rodent species scored low (10/46) or very low (18/46). All monotremes (N=1) and marsupials (N=4) scored very low. All birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles scored very low, with less than 18/25 ACE2 residues identical to the human and many non-conservative residues at the remaining non-identical sites. Notable species scoring very low include the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), and white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis).

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !h self assert = Structural analysis of variation in human ACE2: With an estimated summed frequency of 0.001, genetic variation in the ACE2 S-binding interface is overall rare, and it is unclear whether the variation that does exist increases or decreases susceptibility to infection.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !i self assert = Evolution of ACE2 across mammals: The majority of ACE2 codons are significantly conserved across vertebrates and across mammals, likely reflecting its critical function in the renin-angiotensin system, with ten residues in the ACE2 binding domain exceptionally conserved in Chiroptera and/or Rodentia.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !j self assert = Evolution of ACE2: We found rare variants that would result in missense mutations in 7 out of the 25 binding residues. Some of those (e.g. E35K with an AF of 0.00001636) could reduce the virus binding affinity, thus potentially lowering the susceptibility to the virus in a very small fraction of the population. The analysis suggests that some variants (e.g. D38E) might not affect the binding while others (e.g. S19P) have uncertain effects. Further studies are needed to confirm and correctly address recent discoveries and the data presented here, investigating the possible effect of these rare variants in specific populations.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !k self assert = When exploring patterns of codon evolution in ACE2, we found that a number of sites are evolving at different rates in the different lineages represented in our 410-species vertebrate alignment. Multiple ACE2 RBD residues important for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 are evolving rapidly across mammals, with two (Q24 and H34) under positive selection. Relative to other lineages analyzed, Chiroptera has a greater proportion of accelerated versus conserved residues, particularly at the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, suggesting the possibility of selective forces on these codons in Chiroptera driven by their interactions with SARS-CoV-2-like viruses. Indeed, distinct signatures of positive selection found in bats and in the SARS-CoV S protein support this hypothesis that bats are evolving to tolerate SARS-CoV-2-like viruses.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !l self assert = ACE2 shows significant evidence of positive selection across mammals (⍵=1.83, LRT=194.13, p<0.001). Almost 10% of codons (N=73; 9 near the RBD) are accelerated within mammals, and 18 of these have BEB scores greater than 0.95, indicating positively selected residues. Nineteen accelerated residues, including two positively-selected codons, are critical for the binding of the ACE2 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S. Q24 has not been observed to be polymorphic within the human population, and H34 harbors a synonymous polymorphism (AF=0.00063) but no non-synonymous polymorphisms.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !m self assert = This pattern of acceleration and positive selection in ACE2 also holds for individual mammalian lineages. Using CODEML, positive selection was detected within the orders Chiroptera (LRT=346.40, ⍵=3.44 p<0.001), Cetartiodactyla (LRT=92.86, ⍵=3.83, p<0.001), Carnivora (LRT=65.66, ⍵=2.27. p<0.001), Primates (LRT=72.33, ⍵=3.16, p<0.001) and Rodentia (LRT=91.26, ⍵=1.77, p<0.001). Overall, bats had more positively selected sites with significant BEB scores (29 sites in Chiroptera compared to 10, 8, 7 and 15 sites in Cetartiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates and Rodentia, respectively).). Positive selection at key sites for the binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 was only found in the bat-specific alignment.

These residues did not correspond to known viral binding sites. We found no evidence for lineage-specific positive selection in the ancestral primate, rodent or carnivore lineages.

    let !o self assert = PhyloP identified lineage-specific acceleration in Chiroptera, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla and Cetaceans relative to mammals. Bats have a particularly high level of accelerated evolution (18 codons; p<0.05). Of these accelerated residues, T27 and M82 are known to be important for binding SARS-CoV-2, with some bat subgroups having amino acids predicted to lead to less favorable binding of SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, a residue that is conserved overall in our 410 species alignment and in the mammalian subset, Q728, is perfectly conserved in all 37 species of bats except for fruit bats (Pteropodidae), which have a substitution from Q to E. These results support the theory that ACE2 is under lineage-specific selective pressures in bats relative to other mammals.

All of these sites lie within or near the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S RBD binding sites.

    let !q self assert = Relationship of the ACE2 binding score to known infectivity of SARS-CoV-2: Data on susceptibility of wild animals to SARS-CoV-2 is still very limited. Previous study results agree with our predictions of ACE2 binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 S; 4/5 five species with demonstrated susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 score very high (Rhesus macaque) or medium (domestic cat, tiger and Golden hamster). The only inconsistency was observed for ferrets, which had a low ACE2 binding score. This inconsistency could be related to the high infectivity dose used for experimental infection that likely does not correspond to virus exposure in nature.

    let !r self assert = Dogs have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 under experimental conditions, and score low for binding of their ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S. However, kidney cell lines derived from dog showed ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 S entry, suggesting that in vitro experiments may be overestimating true infectivity potential. Pigs (low), ducks (very low) and chickens (very low) were similarly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and showed no susceptibility, providing further support of our methodology.

    let !s self assert = A recent publication reporting that SARS-CoV-2 could use pig, masked palm civet and Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ACE2 expressed in HeLa cells were inconsistent with our predictions, while data for mouse was in agreement. Indeed, while mouse ACE2 scored very low in our analysis, pig and Chinese rufous horseshoe bat score low, while the masked palm civet scored very low. As for the ferret, high-level exposure to the virus in vitro could potentially result in infection via low affinity interactions with ACE2.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !t self assert = Another possibility is that other cellular machinery present in the human HeLa cells is facilitating the infection, and that infectivity does not relate directly to ACE2 differences in these species. Confirmation of in vitro and in vivo susceptibility of these species under physiological conditions and with proper controls is clearly necessary. In addition, the expression of ACE2 varies across animal age, cell types, tissues and species, which may lead to discrepancies between SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility gleaned from experimental infections or laboratory experiments and predictions made from the ACE2-based binding score.

Thus, many of the 21 primate species native to China could be a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining primate species were scored as high or medium, with only the Gray mouse lemur and the Philippine tarsier scoring as low.

While coronavirus sequences have been found in white tailed deer and gammacoronaviruses have been found in beluga whales and bottlenose dolphins and are associated with respiratory diseases, the cellular receptor used by these viruses is not known.

    let !z self assert = Rodents: Among the rodents, 7/46 species score high for ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S, with the remaining 11, 10 and 18 scoring medium, low or very low, respectively. Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus), scored very low, consistent with infectivity studies. Given that wild rodent species likely come in contact with bats as well as with other predicted high risk species, we urge surveillance of high and medium binding likelihood rodents for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !aa self assert = Bats and other species of interest: We analyzed ACE2 from 37 bat species of which 8 and 29 scored low and very low, respectively. These results were unexpected because the three Rhinolophus spp. including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat are major suspects in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, or a closely related virus, to humans. We found evidence for accelerated evolution at six RBD binding domain residues within the bat lineage, which is more than in any other lineage tested. Bats also had far more sites showing evidence of positive selection, including four binding domain residues, compared to other mammalian orders. This suggests that the diversity observed in bat ACE2 sequences may be driven by selective pressure from coronaviruses.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !ab self assert = Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to use the ACE2 receptor in bats, which challenges a recent study showing that SARS-CoV-2 can infect HeLa cells expressing Rhinolophus sinicus ACE2. If bats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus likely uses a different receptor. For example, the MERS-CoV, a betacoronavirus, uses CD26/DPP4 while the porcine transmissible enteritis virus, an alphacoronavirus uses aminopeptidase N (ANPEP). As detailed above, further in vitro and in vivo infectivity studies are required to fully understand the mode of transmission of susceptibility of bats to SARS-CoV-2.

    let !ac self assert = Carnivores: Our results are consistent with these studies; 9/9 felids we analyzed scored medium for ACE2 binding of SARS-CoV-2 S. However, the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), a member of the Viverridae family that is related to but distinct from Felidae, scored as very low. These results are inconsistent with transfection studies using civet ACE2 receptors expressed in HeLa cells, although these experiments have limitations as discussed above. While carnivores closely related to dogs (dingos, wolves and foxes) all scored low, experimental data supporting infection in dogs were inconsistent so no conclusions can be drawn.

    let !ad self assert = Pangolins: In our study, ACE2 of Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), and white bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) had low or very low binding score for SARS-CoV-2 S. Neither experimental infection nor in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for pangolins. As for ferrets and bats, if SARS-CoV-2 infects pangolins it may be using a receptor other than ACE2, based on our analysis.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !ae self assert = Other vertebrates: Our analysis of 29 orders of fishes, 29 orders of birds, 3 orders of reptiles and 2 orders of amphibians predicts that the ACE2 proteins of species within these vertebrate classes are not likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 S. Thus, vertebrate classes other than mammals are not likely to be an intermediate host or reservoir for the virus, despite predictions reported in a recent study, unless SARS-CoV-2 can use another receptor for infection. With many different non-mammal vertebrates sold in the seafood and wildlife markets of Asia and elsewhere, it is still important to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be found in non-mammalian vertebrates.

This represents only a small fraction of the threatened species potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. For example, all 20 catarrhine primate species in our analysis, representing three families (Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae, and Hominidae) scored very high, suggesting that all 185 species of catarrhine primates, most of which are classified Threatened, are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

    let !ag self assert = Similarly, all three species of deer, representatives of a family of ~92 species (Cervidae), scored as high risk, as did species representing Cetacea (baleen and toothed whales), and both groups contain a number of threatened species. Toothed whales have potential for viral outbreaks and have lost function of a gene key to the antiviral response in other mammalian lineages. If they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 , human-to-animal transmission could pose a risk through sewage outfall and contaminated refuse from cities, commercial vessels and cruise liners. In contrast, some threatened species scored low or very low, such as the giant panda (low), potentially positive news for these at risk populations.

    let !ai self assert = While species ranked high or medium may be susceptible to infection based on the features of their ACE2 residues, pathological outcomes may be very different among species depending on other mechanisms that could affect virus replication and spread to target cells, tissues, and organs within the host. Nonetheless, our predictions provide a useful starting point for selection of appropriate animal models for COVID-19 research and for identification of species that may be at risk for human-to-animal or animal-to-animal transmissions by SARS-CoV-2. The approach we used for ACE2 can be extended to other cellular proteins known to be involved in coronavirus infection and immunity to better understand infection, transmission, inflammatory responses and disease progression.

This is especially important with regards to species, endangered or otherwise, in human care.

    >>> Abstract
      Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary. For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARSCoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.

This result also indicates the SARs-CoV-1 may not well established in the human population at the early stage when it first transmitted from an intermediate animal host. For SARs-CoV-2, the virus presents high infectivity and efficient transmission capability among the human population since it is firstly identified.

Nevertheless, in the absence of containment actions, growth rates can be substantial even in warm climates.

    >>> Abstract
      Environmental factors, including seasonal climatic variability, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks, but relationships between Covid-19 dynamics and climate remain controversial. We assessed the impact of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of Covid-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-March 2020. Here we show that Covid-19 growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 C, and specific humidity of 4-6 g/m3 during the outbreak period, while they were lower both in warmer/wetter and colder/dryer regions. Relationships between Covid-19 and climate were robust to the potential confounding effects of air pollution and socio-economic variables, including population size, density and health expenditure. The strong relationship between local climate and Covid-19 growth rates suggests the possibility of seasonal variation in the spatial pattern of outbreaks, with temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere becoming at particular risk of severe outbreaks during the austral autumn-winter.

First, coronavirus persistence outside the organisms decreases at high temperature, medium-high humidity, and under sunlight, even though they can survive several hours at temperatures >30° C 5,24, implying that high ambient temperatures are not enough to quickly inactivate the infection. Second, host susceptibility can be higher in cold and dry environments, for instance because of a slower mucociliary clearance, or a decreased host immune function under harsher conditions.

  // Airborne transmission of COVID-19: epidemiologic evidence from two outbreak investigations
  doi: https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36685.38881
  ref 'Shen_et_al_04_03_2020
    head =  We investigated two COVID-19 outbreaks in Zhejiang Province and found that airborne transmission at least partially explains the extraordinary attack rate seen. Both investigations suggest that, in closed environments with air re-circulation, COVID-19 is a highly transmissible pathogen.

    >>> Background:
      Much remains unknown about COVID-19 transmission. We evaluated potential transmission routes from two community COVID-19 outbreaks.
    >>> Methods:
      In the first outbreak, 126 passengers took two buses (59 from Bus 1 and 67 from 2) on a 100-minute round trip to attend a 150-minute worship event. The source patient was a passenger on Bus 2. We compared risks of COVID-19 among individuals taking Bus 1 (n=60) and Bus 2 (n=67), and among all other individuals (n=172) attending the worship event. We also divided seats on the exposed bus into high- and low-risk zones according to distance to the source patient and compared COVID-19 risks in each zone. The second outbreak occurred among 30 trainees attending a 3-day workshop in several conference rooms. In both buses and conference rooms, central air-conditioners were in indoor recirculation mode.
    >>> Results:
      In the first COVID-19 outbreak, passengers in Bus 2 had a 41.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6–669.5) times higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared to those in Bus 1, and 11.4 (95% CI: 5.1–25.4) times higher risk compared to all other individuals attending the worship event. Within Bus 2, passengers in high-risk zones had moderately, but nonsignificantly, higher risk for COVID-19 compared to those in the low-risk zones. In the second outbreak, the overall attack rate was 48.3%.
    >>> Conclusion:
      Airborne spread of COVID-19 appears to at least partially explain the high attack rates in the exposed bus and conference rooms. Future efforts at prevention and control must consider the potential for airborne spread of the virus.

  ref 'Santesmasses_et_al_04_15_2020
    head = Our study establishes COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging. This conclusion is based on (i) an exponential growth of its CFR with age, (ii) the COVID-19 mortality rate doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality, (iii) higher mortality in men than in women, (iv) strong association with pre-existing age-related diseases, (v) COVID-19 being a subset of all-cause pneumonia, which is itself a disease of aging, and (vi) an age-related increase in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor mRNA expression in the lungs of non-ventilator subjects.

    >>> Abstract
      COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that poses one of the greatest challenges to public health in recent years. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and often leads to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and death in the elderly and subjects with pre-existing conditions, but the reason for this age dependence is unclear. Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in Italy, Spain, South Korea, and China, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator. Together, our findings establish COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging, and age and age-related diseases as its major risk factors. In turn, this suggests that COVID-19, and deadly respiratory diseases in general, may be targeted, in addition to therapeutic approaches that affect specific pathways, by approaches that target the aging process.

    let !a self assert = Our finding of an elevated age-related expression of ACE2 in the lungs of subjects with non-ventilator deaths may provide a clue. An age-related increase in the expression of this gene, together with the depletion of antiviral defenses, would naturally support a higher damaging effect of the coronavirus in the lung. It should be noted, however, that while ACE2 specifically promotes SARS-coronavirus infections, it also protects lungs from injury.

    # / April, 2020 - medRxiv
    # let !b self assert = In addition, various tissues harbor different ACE2 gene expression levels and may account for complications other than pneumonia, such as diarrhea observed in a small sample of COVID-19 positive patients. At the protein level, lung and its alveolar type II cells were found to have low or undetectable ACE2 protein levels. Interestingly, ventilator cases showed no increase in ACE2 expression with age. The main difference between ventilator and non-ventilator cases is in the young subjects, wherein the expression of ACE2 in the ventilator cases is higher. The implications of variable expression patterns of ACE2 mRNA and protein across ages, tissues, and ventilator cases should be investigated in further studies.

    / April, 2020 - medRxiv
    let !c self assert = Vaccines are less efficient in the elderly, leading to a high rate of infections even in vaccinated individuals. For example, the yearly influenza vaccine is only 40% to 60% efficient in older individuals. Therefore, targeting ACE2 may be viewed as both an immediate and a long-term strategy. However, as the case fatality rate grows with age, it should be possible to also adjust the pace of aging thereby targeting COVID-19. There are plenty of candidates for such a strategy.

    >>> Abstract
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption1,2. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds). Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors. Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.

At clinical doses Nelfinavir can maintain strong antiviral effect over time and thus can reduce SARS-CoV-2 RNAburden that results in shortening the time required to eliminate infection.

    >>> Abstract
      Antiviral treatments targeting the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently required. We screened a panel of already-approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and identified two new antiviral agents: the HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir and the anti-inflammatory drug Cepharanthine. In silico modeling shows Nelfinavir binds the SARS-CoV-2 main protease consistent with its inhibition of viral replication, whilst Cepharanthine inhibits viral attachment and entry into cells. Consistent with their different modes of action, in vitro assays highlight a synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. Mathematical modeling in vitro antiviral activity coupled with the known pharmacokinetics for these drugs predicts that Nelfinavir will facilitate viral clearance. Combining Nelfinavir/Cepharanthine enhanced their predicted efficacy to control viral proliferation, to ameliorate both the progression of disease and risk of transmission. In summary, this study identifies a new multidrug combination treatment for COVID-19.

However, higher doses of CEP, based on its relatively safe toxicity profile, may increase drug efficacy in a clinical setting. It is noteworthy that combining CEP with NFV further reduced the cumulative viral load and facilitated virus elimination. As the cumulative viral load in patients is likely to be closely related with the progression of disease and the risk for new transmission.

    >>> Abstract
      In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. No specific treatment has been established against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) so far. Therefore, it is urgently needed to identify effective antiviral agents for the treatment of this disease, and several approved drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we report that nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2. The effective concentrations for 50% and 90% inhibition (EC50 and EC90) of nelfinavir were 1.13 µM and 1.76 µM respectively, the lowest of the nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors including lopinavir. The trough and peak serum concentrations of nelfinavir were three to six times higher than EC50 of this drug. These results suggest that nelfinavir is a potential candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and should be assessed in patients with COVID-19.

Our single cell profiles illustrated a sustained humoral and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response of COVID-19 patients at both severe and recovery stage. For example, the proportion of plasma B cells with antibody-secreting function were keeping at high levels and the cytotoxicity and cytokine production of effector CD8+ 226 T cells were also remained stable in severe COVID-19 patients after Tocilizumab treatment.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 40,000 deaths worldwide. Approximately 14% of patients with COVID-19 experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill2. Studies have shown that dysregulation of the COVID-19 patients’ immune system may lead to inflammatory storm and cause severe illness and even death. Tocilizumab treatment targeting interleukin 6 receptor has shown inspiring clinical results of severe COVID-19 patients5. However, the immune network with Tocilizumab treatment at single cell resolution has not been uncovered. Here, we profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of 13,289 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at three longitudinal stages from two severe COVID-19 patients treated with Tocilizumab. We identified a severe stage-specific monocyte subpopulation and these cells centric immune cell interaction network connected by the inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The over-activated inflammatory immune response was attenuated after Tocilizumab treatment, yet immune cells including plasma B cells and CD8+ T cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients. These results provided critical insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and revealed fundamentals of effectiveness in Tocilizumab treatment.

    >>> Abstract
      After analyzing the immune characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes with large amount of interleukin 6 secreting may incite the inflammatory storm, which may potentially be curbed through monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People’s Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020. The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days. Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy. CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%). The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab. Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.

      Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6), emerged as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms recently. In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Two of them were moderately ill, six were seriously ill and seven were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients. Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment. TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, the repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended.

    >>> Abstract
      The pandemic Coronavirus-disease 19 (COVID-19) is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical course. While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10-5). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10-8, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of ≥ 80 pg/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.

This suggests that the progression of COVID-19 to complicated disease may be the consequence of an excessive host immune response and autoimmune injury.

    >>> Purpose:
      Coronaviruses may activate dysregulated host immune responses. As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19 and that the anti-IL-6 biologic tocilizumab may be beneficial, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field.
    >>> Methods:
      We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in COVID-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models.
    >>> Results:
      Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2=100%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed.
    >>> Conclusions:
      In patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab appears to be efficacious and safe in preliminary investigation, the results of several ongoing clinical trials should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 prior to routine clinical application.

    head = Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

    >>> Background
      Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.

    >>> Methods
      From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.

    >>> Findings
      Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6).

    >>> Interpretation
      Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

    let !a self assert = The mean age of the population was 45 years, and 307 (79%) of 391 cases were adults aged 30–69 years. and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204).At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (102 [26%] of 391) or moderate (254 [65%] of 391), and only 35 (9%) were severe. 330 (84%) of 391 cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while 25 (6%) of 391 had no signs or symptoms.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert = Compared to cases with mild symptoms, those with severe symptoms had a 41% (95% CI 24–60) longer time to recovery. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died. These deaths occurred 35–44 days from symptom onset and 27–33 days from confirmation; 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22).

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = A larger proportion of cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were male (161 [55%] of 292 vs 24 [28%] of 87) and aged 20–69 years (266 [91%] of 292 vs 65 [75%] of 87) than were those detected through contact-based surveillance.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !d self assert = At the time of the first clinical assessment, 25 (29%) of 87 cases in the contact-based surveillance group did not have fever, and 17 (20%) of 87 had no symptoms. By contrast, 258 (88%) of 292 in the symptom-based surveillance group had fever, and only eight reported no symptoms.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !e self assert = In multiple logistic regression, male sex was associated with severe symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2·5 [95% CI 1·1–6·1]). The probability of severe symptoms increased slightly with age, although only individuals aged 60–69 years had a significantly increased risk compared with the reference category, individuals aged 50–59 years (OR 3·4 [95% 1·4–9·5]).

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !f self assert = Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7).

    let !g self assert = Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet
    let !h self assert = Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected, we found that the secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8) among household contacts and 6·6% (5·4–8·1) overall (the secondary attack rate increased to 14·9% [12·1–18·2] among household contacts and 9·7% [7·9–11·8] overall if those with missing results were removed from the denominator). In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, household contact (OR 6·3; 95% CI 1·5–26·3) and travelling together (OR 7·1; 1·4–34·9) were significantly associated with infection. Reporting contact that occurred often was also associated with increased risk of infection compared with moderate-frequency contact (OR 8·8; 95% CI 2·6–30·1; table 3).

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !i self assert = Cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed on average 5·5 days (95% CI 5·0–5·9) after symptom onset (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2), whereas those detected by contact-based surveillance were confirmed on average 3·2 days (95% CI 2·7–3·8) after symptom onset. 17 (5%) of 342 cases with a known onset date and start date of quarantine were isolated before developing symptoms. Among those isolated after developing symptoms, the symptom-based surveillance group was, on average, isolated 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after symptom onset, whereas the contact-based surveillance group was isolated 2·7 days (2·1–3·3) after symptom onset. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2·3-day (95% CI 1·5–3·0) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1·9-day (1·1–2·7) decrease in time to isolation.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !j self assert = We observed some indication of elevated attack rates in older age groups. Notably, the rate of infection in children younger than 10 years (7·4%) was similar to the population average (6·6%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !k self assert = 95% of secondary cases were expected to develop symptoms within 14·3 days (95% CI 11·1–17·6) of their infector. This estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infected individual was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3·6 days, increasing to 8·1 days if the infected individual was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !l self assert = The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (ie, the observed reproductive number, R), was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5). The distribution of individual R values was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8·9% (95% CI 3·5–10·8) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0·58; 95% CI 0·35–1·18).

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !m self assert = We found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0·4, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5·5 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset.

    / April, 2020 - The Lancet Infectious Diseases
    let !n self assert = Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (eg, if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R0=2·6, the cases captured by surveillance must, if not isolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone

  // Presenting Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Outcomes Among 5700 Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in the New York City Area
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6775
  article 'Richardson_et_al_04_22_2020
    head = This study represents the first large case series of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area, US. Older persons, men, and those with pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes were highly prevalent in this case series and the pattern was similar to data reported from China. However, mortality rates in this case series were significantly lower, possibly due to differences in thresholds for hospitalization.

    >>> Importance
      There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

    >>> Objective
      To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a US health care system.

    >>> Design, Setting, and Participants
      Case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system. The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates.

    >>> Exposures
      Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission.

    >>> Main Outcomes and Measures
      Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected.

    >>> Results
      A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range (IQR), 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2%), 38 (3.3%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5%) died, and 831 (72.2%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).

    >>> Conclusions and Relevance
      This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.

    head = Our findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement (as noted with presence of viral bodies) and of the host inflammatory response. In addition, induction of apoptosis and pyroptosis might have an important role in endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-endotheliitis could explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their clinical sequelae in patients with COVID-19.

    let !a self assert = This hypothesis provides a rationale for therapies to stabilise the endothelium while tackling viral replication, particularly with anti-inflammatory anti-cytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins. This strategy could be particularly relevant for vulnerable patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

The patients condition deteriorated following COVID-19 diagnosis, and he required mechanical ventilation. Multisystem organ failure occurred, and the patient died on day 8. Post-mortem analysis of the transplanted kidney by electron microscopy revealed viral inclusion structures in endothelial cells. In histological analyses, we found an accumulation of inflammatory cells associated with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies, in the heart, the small bowel and lung. An accumulation of mononuclear cells was found in the lung, and most small lung vessels appeared congested.

She developed progressive respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and subsequently developed multi-organ failure and needed renal replacement therapy. On day 16, mesenteric ischaemia prompted removal of necrotic small intestine. Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis. We found histological evidence of myocardial infarction but no sign of lymphocytic myocarditis. Histology of the small intestine showed endotheliitis (endothelialitis) of the submucosal vessels.

    let !e self assert = We found evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation. Although the virus uses ACE2 receptor expressed by pneumocytes in the epithelial alveolar lining to infect the host, thereby causing lung injury, the ACE2 receptor is also widely expressed on endothelial cells, which traverse multiple organs. Recruitment of immune cells, either by direct viral infection of the endothelium or immune-mediated, can result in widespread endothelial dysfunction associated with apoptosis

  article 'Zhang_et_al_04_29_2020
    head = Daily contacts were reduced 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults 15-64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95%CI 0.24-0.49), while in contrast, individuals over 65 years are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95%CI: 1.12-1.92). Based on these data, we build a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.

    >>> Abstract
      Intense non-pharmaceutical interventions were put in place in China to stop transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults 15-64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95%CI 0.24-0.49), while in contrast, individuals over 65 years are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95%CI: 1.12-1.92). Based on these data, we build a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.

    / April, 2020 - Science
    let !a self assert = We analyzed a total of 1,245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in Wuhan, and 1,296 contacts reported by 557 participants in Shanghai. In Wuhan, the average daily number of contacts per participant was significantly reduced from 14.6 for the baseline period (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 14.0) to 2.0 for the outbreak period (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 1.9) (p<0.001). The reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex, age group, type of profession, and household size (Table 1). A larger reduction was observed in Shanghai, where the average daily number of contacts declined from 18.8 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 19.8) to 2.3 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 2.1). Although an average individual in Shanghai reported more contacts than one in Wuhan on a regular weekday, this difference essentially disappeared during the COVID-19 outbreak period.

    / April, 2020 - Science
    let !b self assert =  Overall, contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members (94.1% in Wuhan and 78.5% in Shanghai). These findings are consistent with trends in within-city mobility data, which indicate an 86.9% drop in Wuhan and 74.5% in Shanghai between early January and early February. Such a large decrease in internal mobility is consistent with most of contacts occurring in the household during the outbreak period. Of note, the strict social distancing measures implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai did not entirely zero out contacts in the workplace, as essential workers continued to perform their activities.

    / April, 2020 - Science
    let !c self assert = We found that susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection increased with age. Young individuals (aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual aged 15-64 years [OR=0.34 (95%CI: 0.24-0.49), p-value<0.0001]. In contrast, older individuals aged 65 years and over had a higher risk of infection than adults 15-64 years [OR=1.47 (95%CI: 1.12-1.92), p-value=0.005]. These findings are in contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age.

    / April, 2020 - Science
    let !d self assert = In the early phases of COVID-19 spread in Wuhan, before interventions were put in place, R0 values were estimated to range between 2.0 and 3.5 (12–18). In this analysis, we extended this range from 1 to 4 for the baseline period (i.e., before interventions). We find that the considerable changes of mixing patterns observed in Wuhan and Shanghai during the social distancing period led to a drastic decrease in R0. This finding is robust to relaxing assumptions about age differences in susceptibility to infection; the epidemic is still well controlled if SARS-CoV-2 infection is assumed to be equally likely in all age groups. We also performed sensitivity analyses regarding possible recall and compliance biases of self-reported contacts as well as the definition of contact (i.e., considering only contacts lasting more than 5 min). The results are consistent with those reported here.

    / April, 2020 - Science
    let !e self assert = In an uncontrolled epidemic (without intervention measures, travel restrictions, or spontaneous behavioral responses of the population), and for R0 in the range 2-3, we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 53%-92% after a year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, with slight variation between Wuhan and Shanghai. These estimates should be considered as an upper bound of the infection attack rate as they are based on a compartmental model that does not account for high clustering of contacts (e.g., repeated contacts among household members).

    / April, 2020 - Science
    let !f self assert = If we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on, as the new virus emerges, the estimated R0 remains under the epidemic threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location. Furthermore, we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai would have been enough to block transmission for an R0 before the interventions up to ~6 in Wuhan and ~7.8 in Shanghai.

    / April, 2020 - Science

Removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline R0 up to 1.2.

For instance, for baseline R0=2.5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the mean peak daily incidence is reduced by about 64%. In the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed, we estimate a reduction of about 42%.

    let !k self assert = Our study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in Wuhan and Shanghai, and the resulting changes in human behavior, drastically decreased daily contacts, essentially reducing them to household interactions. This leads to a dramatic reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As lockdown measures are put in place in other locations, human mixing patterns in the outbreak period could be captured by data on within-household contacts, which are available for several countries around the world. Moving forward, it will be particularly important to design targeted strategies for long-term control of COVID-19, including school- and work-based control strategies, along with large scale testing and contact tracing. Research should concentrate on refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection, disease, and infectiousness, which are instrumental to evaluating the impact of these strategies.

  // Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Inflammatory Signaling Increase the Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 in the Respiratory Tract
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.05.012
  article 'Smith_et_al_04_26_2020
    head = Cigarette smokers harbor consistently higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in their respiratory tracts. This upregulation is likely mediated by the expansion of ACE2+ secretory cells caused by chronic smoke exposure. Certain inflammatory cytokines also trigger ACE2 upregulation, which could further influence ACE2 expression due to smoking-associated lung inflammation.

    >>> Abstract
      The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.

Additionally, we speculate that the interferon-dependent upregulation of ACE2 could create a positive feedback loop for SARS-CoV-2 infections. That is, interferon secretion following an initial infection could increase ACE2 expression within neighboring cells, thereby rendering those cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and facilitating viral dissemination.

    >>> Abstract
      COVID-19 has spread worldwide since 2019 and is now a severe threat to public health. We previously identified the causative agent as a novel SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the entry receptor. Here, we successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 transgenic mouse (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice) infection model. The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients. Viral quantification revealed the lungs as the major site of infection, although viral RNA could also be found in the eye, heart, and brain in some mice. Virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome sequences was isolated from the infected lung and brain tissues. Lastly, we showed that pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could protect mice from severe pneumonia. Our results show that the hACE2 mouse would be a valuable tool for testing potential vaccines and therapeutics.

Transfer efficiency with a smooth plastic surface for both gloved and un-gloved hands was higher than current literature suggests.

    >>> Abstract
      Bacterial transmission from contaminated surfaces via hand contact plays a critical role in disease spread. However, the fomite‐to‐finger transfer efficiency of microorganisms during multiple sequential surface contacts with and without gloves has not been formerly investigated.
      We measured the quantity of Escherichia coli on fingertips of participants after one‐to‐eight sequential contacts with inoculated plastic coupons with and without nitrile gloves. A Bayesian approach was used to develop a mechanistic model of pathogen accretion to examine finger loading as a function of the difference between E. coli on surfaces and fingers. We used the model to determine the coefficient of transfer efficiency (λ), and influence of swabbing efficiency and finger area.
      Results showed λ for bare skin was higher (49%, 95%CI=32‐72%) than for gloved hands (30%, CI=17‐49%). Microbial load tended towards a dynamic equilibrium after four and six contacts for gloved hands and bare skin, respectively. Individual differences between volunteers’ hands had a negligible effect compared with use of gloves (p <0.01). Gloves reduced loading by 4.7% (CI=‐12%‐21%) over bare skin contacts whilst 20% of participants accrued more microorganisms on gloved hands. This was due to poor fitting, which created a larger finger surface area than bare hands.

The finding of high ACE2 expression of in central glial substance and brain ventricles suggest two potential novel routes for the SARS-CoV-2 entering the CSF and/or spreading around the brain.

    >>> Abstract
      By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some important brain areas, such as the substantia nigra and brain ventricles. According to our cell-type distribution analysis, the expression of ACE2 were found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, but the ACE2-expressing cells was none in the prefrontal cortex and very few in the hippocampus. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable to result in serious central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

      The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to contrast the disease. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible to those observed in the transcriptomic data.

    head = Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1, suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%).

    >>> Background
      A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others.

    >>> Methods
      We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution.

    >>> Results
      Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R0 and k (95% CrIs: R0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution.

    >>> Conclusions
      Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.

    head = Our study demonstrates the presence of S-reactive CD4+ 161 T cells in COVID-19 patients, and in  a subset of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HD. In light of the very recent emergence of SARS CoV-2, our data raise the intriguing possibility that pre-existing S-reactive T cells in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HD represent cross-reactive clones raised against S-proteins, probably acquired as a result of previous exposure to HCoV.

    >>> Abstract
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a rapidly unfolding pandemic, overwhelming health care systems worldwide1. Clinical manifestations of Corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death2, yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown. Also, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogenesis remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002/03), however, CD4+ T cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes3,4, while cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been investigated. Here we describe an assay that allows direct detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. We demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors, albeit at lower frequencies. Strikingly, in COVID-19 patients S-reactive CD4+ T cells equally targeted both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of S whereas in healthy donors S-reactive CD4+ T cells reacted almost exclusively to the Cterminal part that is a) characterized by higher homology to spike glycoprotein of human endemic "common cold" coronaviruses, and b) contains the S2 subunit of S with the cytoplasmic peptide (CP), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) but not the receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-reactive CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co-expressed higher levels of CD38 and HLA-DR, indicating their recent in vivo activation. Our study is the first to directly measure SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing, in depth epitope mapping and characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective cohort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a correlate of protection or pathology. Results of such studies will be key for a mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adaptation of containment methods and to support vaccine development.

    let !a self assert = Based on epidemiological data indicating an average of two episodes of “common cold” per year in the adult population, it may be extrapolated that the average adult contracts a HCoV infection on average every two to three years. Protective antibodies may wane in the interim but cellular immunity could remain.

    let !b self assert = Although the overall amino acid sequence homology of spike glycoproteins is relatively low among HCoV, there is an overlap of MHC-II epitopes located especially in the C-terminal domain of the here used peptide pools. This may explain the preferential reactivity of CD4+ T cells to the C-terminal domain in one third of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HD.

    let !c self assert = SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies are associated with convalescence, and they have been detected 12 months after disease. However, the durability of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 currently remains unknown. Antibodies against HCoV can wane within months after infection, although HCoV re-infection is accompanied by low-level and shortlived virus shedding with only mild symptoms of short duration12 pointing towards residual immunity


  # epidemic, USA, illness severity-correlates to infectivity, close contact
  // First mildly ill, non-hospitalized case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without viral transmission in the United States—Maricopa County, Arizona,
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa374
  article 'Scott_et_al_2020
    head = We summarize the public health investigation, contact tracing, and serial SARS-CoV-2 testing results of the first mildly ill, non-hospitalized U.S. case of COVID-19.

    >>> Background
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity. Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China.

    >>> Methods
      The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (≥10 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Results
      Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), ≥1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative.

    >>> Conclusions
      This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.

    let !a self assert = In this interview, the patient stated that his cough started in mid-December 2019, prior to travel to China, not 2 days before diagnosis as previously reported. His cough was unchanged in character, frequency, and severity at any time during the illness. He denied all additional symptoms, including fever, chills, and shortness of breath. After diagnostic specimen collection on January 22, the case had paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 different time points. In 8 pairs (73%) the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen tested positive or indeterminate; 3 (27%) tested negative.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert = The initial respiratory specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 1 had relatively low Ct values (26.7–28.1 in the oropharyngeal specimen and 31.7–32.8 in the sputum specimen), which suggest higher levels of virus in these specimens, despite the patient’s mild illness. Ct values in specimens collected after symptom resolution, on illnessdays 12, 14, 16, 18, and 22, were >35, suggesting decreasing levels of virus in these specimens.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = On February 5, the patient reported his cough had resolved. On February 19, 14 days after symptom resolution, CDC confirmed the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at 2 consecutive time points ≥24 hours apart and he was released from voluntary isolation.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !d self assert = Sixteen contacts were identified. Eleven (69%) had high-risk exposure: 5 rideshare drivers, 3 healthcare personnel, 2 housemates, and 1 intimate contact. Five (31%) healthcare personnel had medium-risk exposure. The intimate contact had stayed with the patient for >36 hours before positive diagnostic testing results were received. All 35 paired specimens (100%) collected from contacts with high-risk exposure tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. On February 3, after the intimate contact’s first specimen tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the intimate contact was placed in voluntary quarantine in separate housing to prevent possible ongoing exposure

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !e self assert =  This investigation demonstrates that a mildly symptomatic individual can have a relatively high viral load and still not transmit the infection to an intimate contact. The case had repeated intimate contact with one person over >36 hours while testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case differs from cases reported in Chicago, Illinois and San Benito County, California, where viral transmission occurred between intimate contacts prior to diagnosis and index cases had more severe illnesses, requiring hospitalization. We hypothesize this could be because the virus is nonviable, but this cannot be confirmed without viral culture data.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !f self assert = Of 16 contacts, 3 (19%) developed a cough during the 14-day post-exposure monitoring period and were considered “persons under investigation” per CDC guidance until clinical specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. By March 5, all 16 contacts completed 14-day post-exposure symptom monitoring periods.

  article 'Xu_et_al_2020b
    head = We found that the median duration from onset of symptoms to RNA clearance was 17 days.   Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

    >>> Background
      An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a public health emergency. Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from 2 hospitals outside Wuhan.

    >>> Results
      The median (interquartile range) duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 (13–22) days as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (≥15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (P = .001), severe illness at admission (P = .049), invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006), and corticosteroid treatment (P = .025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (P < .001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (P < .001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.31–8.02), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10–1.54), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11–88.02) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

    >>> Conclusions
      Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Hospital admission and general treatments should be started as soon as possible in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially male patients.

The proportion of patients with severe disease at admission in the group with prolonged shedding was significantly higher than that in the group with early viral RNA clearance (34.2% vs 16.2%, P = .049). Corticosteroid (P = .025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006) treatments were related to prolonged viral RNA shedding time.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = Prolonged RNA shedding was associated with delayed recovery on radiological imaging (median days, 12 vs 16; P < .001), delayed recovery of body temperature (median days, 7 vs 11; P < .001), and prolonged hospital stay (median days, 13.5 vs 22; P < .001). More patients recovered and were released by 21 days after illness onset (91.9% vs 46.1%, P = .023) in the group with early viral RNA clearance than in the group with prolonged viral RNA shedding.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !e self assert = The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 15 days (IQR, 12–17 days) in the female group and 18.5 days (IQR, 15–25 days) in the male group (P = .013). The proportion of patients with severe disease at admission in the male group (37.9%) was significantly higher than that in the female group (14.9%, P = .010). The median length of hospital stay was longer in the male group than in the female group (median days, 15 vs 22; P = .002). The cumulative probability of viral negative conversion was slightly higher in the female group than that in the male group (P = .043)

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !f self assert = Early (≤5 days) versus later (>5 days) hospital admission was significantly associated with viral RNA clearance speed (P = .004). Late hospital admission was associated with a higher proportion of patients with severe disease at admission (43.4% vs 15.0%, P = .001) and a higher frequency of critically severe illness during hospitalization (30.2% vs 11.7%, P = .019) than was early hospital admission. Our findings also suggest that symptomatic patients should be admitted to the hospital as early as possible if SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed. Delayed hospital admission was associated with more severe conditions at admission and worse treatment outcomes.

    let !g self assert = SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11–88.02; P = .04) compared with those who did not undergo invasive mechanical ventilation.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !i self assert = There was a higher percentage of patients with hypertension in the prolonged-viral-RNA-shedding group than in the early-clearance group; however, hypertension was not a significant risk factor in the logistic regression model. Thus, it was suggested that sex itself is the influencing factor of disease progression.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !j self assert = In our study, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-α were the most frequently used antiviral regimens. It was hard to evaluate the efficacy of these 2-drug combination because of the lack of controls.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !k self assert = Corticosteroid usage was related to prolonged viral RNA shedding time in this report as well, as patients with early RNA clearance had lower proportion of patients using corticosteroid compared with patients with late RNA clearance (40.5% vs 64.5%, P = .025). However, this difference can be influenced by disease severity, as patients who were given corticosteroids usually had more severe disease than those who did not. Furthermore, corticosteroid use was not found to be an independent risk factor for prolonged viral RNA shedding in the multivariable model conducted in this report. Thus, a definitive conclusion that corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding duration in patients with COVID-19 cannot be drawn. The reason for the inconsistent results might be that the corticosteroid doses in this report were relatively low (0.5–1 mg methylprednisolone/kg body weight) for patients with COVID-19.

    / April, 2020 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
    let !l self assert = Invasive mechanical ventilator support was found to be another important independent predictor of prolonged viral RNA shedding. Another potential reason for prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding is the emergence of drug resistance during antiviral treatment, since most of the patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation had a longer hospital stay.

    head = Characterization of the first 12 COVID-19 patients identified in the United States provides insight into the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness, but appropriate monitoring of these patients will present challenges as healthcare systems work to meet the increasing demands.

    >>> Abstract
      Data on the detailed clinical progression of COVID-19 in conjunction with epidemiological and virological characteristics are limited. In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously. Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing. Median age was 53 years (range: 21–68); 8 patients were male. Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2–3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.

Ct values of upper respiratory tract specimens were lower in the first week of illness than the second in most patients (Extended Data Fig. 8); in some patients, low Ct values continued into the second and third week of illness. SARS-CoV-2 rRT–PCR results turned positive in serum of patient 9 in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical deterioration.Ct values and duration of RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract did not seem to differ by hospitalization status or oxygen requirement

    let !o self assert = All patients reported symptom resolution. Eleven patients reported cough (often intermittent) as the last symptom. Median symptom duration was 14 d (range: 6–37). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7 of 12 patients, including in NP (n = 6), OP (n = 3), sputum (n = 1) and stool (n = 3) specimens. Home isolation or Transmission-Based Precautions were discontinued for all patients per CDC criteria4; the last respiratory specimens tested at CDC with a positive test result were collected from these patients on days 8–36 (median = day 19).

The sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes; phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups that were not divergent from each other, suggesting that these patients were identified during an early stage of the outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis from these 12 patients’ respiratory tract specimens support a recent zoonotic transmission event and subsequent human-to-human transmission.

    let !q self assert = The highest viral RNA levels in the upper respiratory tract were typically detected in the first week of illness, and viable SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. Viral RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution for seven patients, although the implications for infectiousness and transmission later in illness are unclear.

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !r self assert =  Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or laboratory signs of worsening including hypoxemia or elevation of aminotransferases. Although some patients received empiric antibiotics for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia, we found definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection. Worsening in the second week of illness is consistent with previous reports, and highlights the importance of close monitoring beyond the first week, even in patients with mild illness or no initial radiographic abnormalities.

    let !s self assert = Patient 9, the most severely ill among this series, experienced clinical deterioration late in the second week of illness. This was the only patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in serum and detection in serum was temporally related to clinical deterioration. Similar observations have been described previously

    / April, 2020 - Nature Medicine
    let !t self assert = We detected viral RNA and cultured virus from upper respiratory specimens, even from patients with predominantly lower respiratory tract illness. Ct values in upper respiratory tract specimens typically were lowest during the first week of illness (suggesting high RNA levels), consistent with previous reports. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper respiratory tract specimens for 2–3 weeks in most patients and for as long as 36 days. Sputum specimens were less frequently available; in two patients with a productive cough and available sputum, viral RNA was detected in sputum longer than in NP or OP specimens. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool of multiple patients and in the serum of one hospitalized patient.

    head = It seems that there was a fluctuating period between the apparent improvement in the hospital and full recovery from the virus. It is probable that 2 negative RT-PCR tests 24 hours apart may not be sufficient for viral clearance evaluation. Repeated viral RT-PCR testing separated by prolonged duration, such as 48 hours, is essential to ensure that the virus has actually cleared and the discharged patients no longer can transmit the virus.

    >>> Abstract
      We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge. We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration (r= -0.637; p=0.002) and time to virus recrudescence (r= 0.52; p=0.008) respectively, suggesting the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in COVID-19 patients.

These were 25 of discharged patients (total 14.5%) sent to hospital again because of the positive RT-PCR results on virus again. With the median age of 28 years (IQR: 16.25-42), 17 of them were females, including 6 children under 12 years old

    let !c self assert = After leaving the hospital to self-quarantine at home, the discharged patients hadn’t taken drug any longer but just monitored at home by RT-PCR detection of COVID-19 with both cloacal swab and nasopharyngeal swab samples in each three days. Unexpectedly, cloacal swab samples of 14 patients turned positive on virus mRNA and another 11 patients showed positive results of nasopharyngeal swab sample testing.

    let !d self assert = Overall, the mean duration from their final negative PCR result to hospital discharge was 2.71±1.88 days. While the average period from positive again to previous discharge lasted for 5.23±4.13 days. Thereby, these 25 patients experienced an average of 7.32±3.86 days from their last negative RT-PCR result to turning positive again.

    let !k self assert =  Besides, the RT-PCR results then turning to negative within an average of 2.73 days of hospital stay. Even the Chinese herbal medicine was used for these readmitted patients, it is hard to assess the effect on virus clearance. Further case-control study and cohort study will be needed to pursue that.

    head = This study is the first case series from 56 COVID-19 patients with 299 samples of RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our preliminary results are notable for providing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 dynamic profile in patients infected. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients. We conclude that longer periods of follow up and repeat testing are necessary to limit viral spread.

    >>> Abstract
      A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic threatens the world. Here, we first studied the dynamics profile of SARS-CoV-2 from 56 recovered COVID-19 patients. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients.

    let !a self assert =  We studied RT-qPCR results from 56 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Each patient received four to seven tests over several weeks after symptom onset. In first 3 weeks after symptoms onset, majority results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. From week 3 after symptoms onset, number of negative RT-PCR results increased. All results of RT-PCR tests were negative in week 6 after onset. The positive rate of RT-PCR test results was highest at week 1 (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and 0% at week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5 and week 6 respectively.

    let !c self assert =  We divided patients into non-prolonged and prolonged shedding group according to nucleic acid conversion time (≤24 days or >24 days). Patients with prolonged viral shedding tend to be older (p=0.011) and were more likely to have comorbidities as diabetes (p=0.016) and hypertension (p=0.006).

  # Transmission Indoor
  // Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058
  article 'Qian_et_al_2020
    head = All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

    >>> Background
      By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted.

    >>> Methods
      Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues.

    >>> Results
      Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

    >>> Conclusions
      All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !b self assert = The average number (SD) of cases per outbreak was 3·921·65. Among the 318 identified outbreaks, more than half (171; 53·8%) involved three cases, more than a quarter (84; 26·4%) involved four cases, and only five (1·6%) outbreaks involved ten or more cases.

    let !c self assert = Among the 318 outbreaks, 129 involved only family members, 133 involved family relatives, 29 involved socially connected individuals, 24 involved socially non-connected, and only three involved multiple relationships. In addition to family members, family relatives and socially connected individuals constituted a large proportion of the infected cases.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !d self assert =  Among the 318 outbreaks, 254 (79·9%) occurred in a home (one in a villa; all others in apartments), 108 (34·0%) in transport, 14 at a restaurant or other food venue, seven at an entertainment venue, and seven at a shopping venue (shopping mall and supermarket), with an additional 26 at a miscellaneous venue (e.g.hospital, hotel room, unspecified community, and thermal power plant).

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !e self assert = Most of the 254 home outbreaks included three to five cases (145 with three cases, 66 with four cases, and 25 with five cases). The average number of cases was 3·7 for the home outbreaks, 3·8 for transport, 4·9 for food venues, 3·6 for entertainment venues, 8·7 for shopping venues, and 4·4 for miscellaneous venues. The proportion of large outbreaks was high for shops and food venues, possibly because more susceptible individuals were present in these venues than in homes. Shopping and entertainment venues were each associated with only seven outbreaks. This seems to suggest the difficulty of implementing preventive measures in places with large numbers of susceptible individuals.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !f self assert = Between 29 December 2019 and 31 January 2020, we also identified 231 outbreaks with known start and end dates of the suspected infectious period. The identified outbreaks peaked between 23 and 28 January (Figure 2A), which coincides with the celebration period of the Chinese New Year (CNY). CNY 2020 lasted from New Year’s Eve on 24 January to the Lantern Festival (i.e., the 15th of Lunar January) on 8 February. The official holiday in mainland China was from 24 to 30 January 2020. The peak date for the number of transport outbreaks was 1 to 2 days earlier than that for the home outbreaks as people travelled home for CNY.

    let !g self assert = We further divided those 126 outbreaks into two subgroups according to the index patient’s symptom-onset date: on or before 28 January (96 outbreaks) and after 28 January (30 outbreaks). The average time from symptom onset to the ending infectious date was 3·76±4·42 days for those on and before 28 January and 0·87±2·80 days for those afterward.

    let !h self assert = Our study does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus. However, among our 7,324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred in a village in Shangqiu, Henan. A 27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with an individual who had returned from Wuhan on 25 January and had the onset of symptoms on 1 February.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !i self assert = The second salient feature of the 318 identified outbreaks is the relatively small number of outbreaks that involved 10 or more cases. The largest outbreak occurred in a Tianjin shopping mall and involved 21 cases, although Wu et al. reported that 25 cases were involved.

    / April, 2020 - Medrxiv
    let !j self assert = The occurrence of many small outbreaks (in number of cases) in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a different transmission pattern from that of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Some virus, epidemiological, and environmental factors could have contributed to this observed difference between the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

    let !k self assert = We do not have data on the hygiene conditions and human density of the infection venues of the 318 outbreaks studied here. The exact location of the infection venues and the necessary parameters such as the floor area or the number of occupants were not provided in the case reports. Instead, we reviewed the current design standards of thermal and ventilation conditions, occupant density and close contact behaviour in the various indoor environments discussed here.  The required ventilation rates vary significantly among homes, offices, trains, and buses. For example, the required ventilation rate is only 3·9 L/s per person in shopping malls and 2·8 L/s per person in public buses, whereas a ventilation rate of 8 to 10 L/s is required for good indoor air quality.26 An international systematic review showed that a rate as high as 25 L/s per person may be needed.

    let !l self assert = This study shows that the individual indoor environments in which we live and work are the most common venues in which the virus of the once-in-a-century-pandemic is transmitted among us. An individual infected in one building may infect others in the building(s) that he or she later visits. People are in constant contact as they move from one indoor space or building to another, which creates an indoor contact network through which a virus can spread.17 The buildings and transport cabins in various parts of the world are thus connected and facilitated the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic virus.

  article 'Alipio_et_al_2020
    head = This study provides substantial information to clinicians and health policy-makers. Vitamin D supplementation could possibly improve clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19.

    >>> Abstract
      The rapid spread of COVID-19 in many areas of the world calls for preventive health measures. Although basic guidelines on infection control are suggested, treatment has remained the best choice to avert mortality. However, for the time being, there are no known vaccines for the disease. In this paper, a multinomial logistic regression was used to predict clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19 based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, the barometer for Vitamin D status. A retrospective multicentre study of 212 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. Data pertaining to clinical features and serum 25(OH)D levels were extracted from the medical records. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U and χ² tests were used to compare differences in the clinical outcomes. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the association between serum 25(OH)D level and clinical outcomes of the cases. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. Mean was used for continuous variables. A p-value below 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Of the 212 cases of COVID-19, majority had ordinary clinical outcome. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 23.8 ng/ml. Serum 25(OH)D level was lowest in critical cases, but highest in mild cases. Serum 25(OH)D levels were statistically significant among clinical outcomes. Majority had insufficient Vitamin D status, most of them were not severe. Vitamin D status is significantly associated with clinical outcomes. A multinomial logistic regression analysis reported that for each standard deviation increase in serum 25(OH)D, the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a severe outcome were approximately 7.94 times (OR=0.126, p<0.001) while interestingly, the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a critical outcome were approximately 19.61 times (OR=0.051, p<0.001). The results suggest that an increase in serum 25(OH)D level in the body could either improve clinical outcomes or mitigate worst (severe to critical) outcomes, while a decrease in serum 25(OH)D level in the body could worsen clinical outcomes of COVID-2019 patients. In conclusion, this study provides substantial information to clinicians and health policy-makers. Vitamin D supplementation could possibly improve clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19. Further research should conduct randomized controlled trials and large population studies to evaluate this recommendation.

The incidence and mortality rates were correlated with DCI, especially in countries with local transmission.

    >>> Abstract
      It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.

    >>> Abstract
      A novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] outbreak has caused a global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [(RdRp), also named nsp12] is the central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, and it appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug remdesivir. We report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of COVID-19 virus full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-angstrom resolution. In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase. The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics that target viral RdRp.

  article 'Hoffmann_et_al_2020
    head = The present study reveals important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. It provides evidence that host cell entry of SARSCoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2. Moreover, it suggests that antibody responses raised against SARS-CoV could at least partially protect against SARSCoV-2 infection.

    >>> Abstract
      The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2- S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.

    >>> Abstract
      In response to antigen challenge, B cells clonally expand, undergo selection and differentiate to produce mature B cell subsets and high affinity antibodies. However, the interplay between dynamic B cell states and their antibody-based selection is challenging to decipher in primary human tissue. We have applied an integrated analysis of bulk and single-cell antibody repertoires paired with single-cell transcriptomics of human B cells undergoing affinity maturation. We define unique gene expression and antibody repertoires of known and novel B cell states, including a pre-germinal centre state primed to undergo class switch recombination. We dissect antibody class-dependent gene expression of germinal centre and memory B cells to find that class switching prior to germinal centre entry dictates the capacity of B cells to undergo antibody-based selection and differentiate. Together, our analyses provide unprecedented resolution into the gene expression and selection dynamics that shape B cell-mediated immunity.

    >>> Abstract
      The human conductive respiratory tract spans a long anatomical distance and represents an important barrier to constrain invading respiratory pathogens. The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33°C and 37°C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Abstract
      The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has spread rapidly on a global scale. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via human respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1–3. This study investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients’ toilet areas. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas was undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions showing peaks in submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions, but these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus.

    >>> Abstract
      Objective: To characterize the clinical features of patients with severe COVID-19 in the UK.
      Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO.
      Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020.
      Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19.
      Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials.
      Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19%) and asthma (14%); 47% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49% of patients were discharged alive, 33% have died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20% were discharged alive, 53% died and 27% remained in hospital.
      Conclusions: We present the largest detailed description of COVID-19 in Europe, demonstrating the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

    >>> Abstract
      Since December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan led to an outbreak throughout China and the rest of the world. To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the People’s Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention. The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.

    >>> Abstract
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus strain disease, has recently emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide. This novel strain is highly transmittable and severe disease has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. More than 600,000 cases have been confirmed and the number of deaths is constantly increasing. COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially those suffering from severe respiratory or systemic manifestations, fall under the spectrum of the acutely ill medical population, which is at increased venous thromboembolism risk. Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients infected with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients’ clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, we highlight the importance of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 infected patients and review relevant data of previous coronavirus epidemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

    >>> Background
      The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While systemic inflammation and pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.

    >>> Objective
      This brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

    >>> Discussion
      The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death. The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness. The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events. Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.

    >>> Conclusions
       Emergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with COVID-19.

    >>> Abstract
      Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [lsqb]HLA[rsqb] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (Lin M, Tseng H-K, Trejaut JA, Lee H-L, Loo J-H, Chu C-C, Chen P-J, Su Y-W, Lim KH, Tsai Z-U, Lin R-Y, Lin R-S, Huang C-H. BMC Med Genet 4:9. 2003.). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.

    >>> Importance
      Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of viral severity in the population.

  article 'Dufresne_et_al_2020
    head = This paper reiterates that when accounting for the full distribution of secondary cases caused by an infected individual, there is no direct relationship between R0 and the size of an outbreak. We also stress that both R0 and the full secondary case distribution are not properties of the disease itself, but are instead set by properties of the pathogen, the host population and the context of the outbreak. Nevertheless, we provide a straightforward methodology for translating estimates of transmission heterogeneity into epidemic forecasts. Altogether, predicting outbreak size based on early data is an incredibly complex challenge but one that is increasingly within reach due to new mathematical analyses and faster communication of public health data.

    >>> Abstract
      The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R0 and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory (Newman2001) that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. %, in the case of COVID-19 from 10-70\% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.

    let !c self assert = Clearly, once interventions are put in place and/or substantial behavioral change occurs, all methods that do not account for these effects will over-estimate the total outbreak size. Nevertheless, our approach provides a much more reasoned estimate of the total risk to any given population, and predictions very close to the most recent seropositivity estimates for the COVID-19 outbreak in a German Municipality and in obstetrical patients presenting for delivery, as well as for SARS among wild animal handlers (other smaller estimates correspond to health-care workers)

    let !d self assert = Higher moments of the distribution of secondary cases can lead a disease with a lower R0 to invade more easily a population and to reach a larger final outbreak size than a disease with a higher R0. Taking into account the contribution of these higher moments also yields better estimates for the final size of outbreaks, as we now show.

    let !e self assert = In practice, three types of data could potentially be used in real time to improve predictions by considering secondary case heterogeneity. First, contact tracing data whose objective is to identify people who may have come into contact with an infectious individual. While mostly a preventive measure to identify cases before complications, it directly informs us about potential secondary cases caused by a single individual, and therefore provides us with an estimate for G1(x). Both for generating accurate predictions of epidemic risk and controlling the outbreak, it is vital to begin contact tracing before numerous transmission chains become widely distributed across space.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !f self assert = Second, viral genome sequences provide information on both the timing of the outbreak [40] and structure of secondary cases. For example, methods exist to reconstruct transmission trees for sampled sequences using simple mutational models to construct a likelihood for a specific transmission tree [42, 43] and translate coalescent rates into key epidemiological parameters. Despite the potential for genome sequencing to revolutionize outbreak response, the global public health community still struggles to coordinate data sharing across international borders, between academic researchers, and with private companies.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !g self assert = Third, early incidence data can be leveraged to infer parameters of the secondary case distribution through comparison with simulations. Comparing the output of agent-based simulations with reported incidence can be used to effectively sample a joint posterior distribution over R0 and dispersion parameter k. Most importantly, these simulations need not be run over long periods of time to predict final outbreak size. Instead, they only need to be run over enough early data to infer the parameter estimates that are then fed into our network model to compute the final outbreak size.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !h self assert = As for COVID-19, how the width of the confidence interval on our prediction for the final outbreak size mostly stems from uncertainty in the heterogeneity of secondary infections; i.e., the dispersion parameter k. With limited heterogeneity, our predictions would have been closer to classic mass-action forecasts and the current pandemic of COVID-19 would likely have been a consequence of not only R0, but of the homogeneity of secondary infections: each new cases steadily leading to additional infections. Thankfully, with recent large estimates for its heterogeneity, the observed transmission could be mostly maintained by so-called “super-spreading events”, which could be easier to manage with contact tracing, screening and infection control.

    head = We estimated several basic epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days), a time dependent duration from symptom onset to hospitalization (changing from 5.5 days in early January to 1.5 days in late January outside Hubei Province), and the time from symptom onset to death (16.1 days). We estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak in Wuhan to be 0.21–0.30 per day (a doubling time of 2.3–3.3 days). Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9).

    >>> Abstract
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2–2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period. We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

    let !a self assert = Our estimate of the time from initial exposure to symptom onset (i.e., the incubation period) is 4.2 days (95% CI 3.5–5.1 days). The time from symptom onset to hospitalization showed evidence of time dependence. Before January 18, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 days (95% CI 4.6–6.6 days), whereas after January 18, the duration shortened significantly to 1.5 days (95% CI 1.2–1.9 days).

    / April, 2020 - Emerging Infectious Diseases
    let !b self assert = We also found that the time from initial hospital admittance to discharge was 11.5 days (95% CI 8.0–17.3 days) and from initial hospital admittance to death was 11.2 days (95% CI 8.7–14.9 days). The time from symptom onset to death was estimated to be 16.1 days (95% CI 13.1–20.2 days).

    / April, 2020 - Emerging Infectious Diseases
    let !c self assert = By using 2 distinct approaches, the analysis suggest that although there exist uncertainties depending on the level of surveillance, the exponential growth rate of the outbreak is probably 0.21–0.3/day. This estimation is much higher than previous reports, in which the growth rate was estimated to be 0.1–0.14/day.

    let !d self assert = We found R0 is likely to be 5.7 given our current state of knowledge, with a broad 95% CI (3.8–8.9). Among many factors, the lack of awareness of this new pathogen and the Lunar New Year travel and gathering in early and mid-January 2020 might or might not play a role in the high R0.

    let !e self assert = The R0 values we estimated have important implications for predicting the effects of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. For example, the threshold for combined vaccine efficacy and herd immunity needed for disease extinction is calculated as 1 – 1/R0. At R0 = 2.2, this threshold is only 55%. But at R0 = 5.7, this threshold rises to 82% (i.e., >82% of the population has to be immune, through either vaccination or prior infection, to achieve herd immunity to stop transmission).

    let !f self assert = Results show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic persons can be effective when the fraction of unidentified persons is low. However, when 20% of transmission is driven by unidentified infected persons, high levels of social distancing efforts will be needed to contain the virus, highlighting the importance of early and effective surveillance, contact tracing, and quarantine.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100
  article 'Gudbjartsson_et_al_2020
    head = In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

    >>> Background
      During the current worldwide pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was first diagnosed in Iceland at the end of February. However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population.

    >>> Methods
      We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples.

    >>> Results
      As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.

    >>> Conclusions
      In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

    let !a self assert =  On April 4, 2020, among the 9199 persons who were targeted for testing, 1221 (13.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through population screening, positive results were reported for 100 of 13,080 participants (0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.0); positive test results were reported for 87 of 10,797 persons (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.0) who accepted the open invitation for testing and 13 of 2283 persons (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9) who were invited at random. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. These results were consistent with a slow spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the Icelandic population.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !b self assert = The lack of increase in the incidence of infection over time may be due to containment efforts by the Icelandic health care authorities and their nimble response to the outbreak abroad. Testing of exposed persons with symptoms had been carried out for 1 month before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was identified in Iceland. Self-isolation, quarantining, and other social-distancing measures may also have helped to prevent an increase in the infection rate.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !c self assert = Of the participants who tested positive from the early targeted-testing phase and who had traveled, 86.1% had visited areas designated as being at high risk by the end of February (China and the Alps mountain regions in Austria, Italy, and Switzerland), whereas only 1 of the participants with a positive test identified through population screening had traveled to a high-risk area. On the other hand, 12 of 87 participants (13.8%) with positive tests in the screening group had recently traveled to the United Kingdom, as compared with 1.8% of those who tested negative, which suggests relatively early spread of the virus in the U.K. population.

    let !d self assert = In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of the participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had recently traveled outside Iceland. In the later phase, 15.5% had recently traveled outside the country. Overall, 23.0% of those with positive test results through population screening had recently traveled, in contrast to 8.7% of those who tested negative.

    let !e self assert = In the early phase of targeted testing, 40.1% of the participants who tested positive reported having had contact with a known infected person, as compared with 60.2% in the later phase of targeted testing. However, only 6.9% of the participants in the population-screening group reported having had contact with an infected person, probably because infected persons and their contacts were in isolation and therefore not eligible for the population screening.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !f self assert = Among the participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms of Covid-19 were reported by 93% of those in the overall targeted-testing group and by 57% of those in the overall population-screening group. However, 29% of participants who tested negative in the overall population-screening group also reported having symptoms. Reports of symptoms became less common among participants in the population screening during the study period (despite the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate), probably owing to a general decrease in other respiratory infections, which in turn may have been brought about through measures implemented to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

    let !i self assert = The haplotype composition of the viruses from persons who were identified through population screening was different from that of viruses infecting persons who tested positive in the early phase of targeted testing, so we conclude that the haplotypes of the virus that were propagating in the general population came from a different source (as compared with those infecting high-risk persons in the early phase of targeted testing), perhaps brought into Iceland by persons arriving from countries that had not yet been designated as high-risk areas.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !j self assert = Several viral lineages have emerged during the 3 to 4 months since the original outbreak in China, with an average of five mutations separating the lineages from the founding haplotype from Wuhan (the central haplotype of clade A). Although the sequencing efforts vary considerably among populations, it is clear that the geographical distribution of clades is highly structured. Thus, A and B haplotypes are common in East Asia, whereas the B1a haplotype appears to be at the center of the outbreak on the West Coast of the United States, and A2a and its descendants are almost exclusively found in European populations.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !k self assert = The A1a haplotype was more common in the general population than in those who received targeted testing, with a total of 23 of 59 haplotypes among participants in the population-screening group, as compared with only 8 of 157 haplotypes in the early-targeted testing.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !l self assert = The composition of haplotypes changed substantially from early targeted testing to later targeted testing. The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes, which had collectively made up 103 of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early-targeted testing, were reduced to 115 of 361 haplotypes (31.9%) in the later-targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and other A2a-derived haplotypes. This change probably meant that population screening identified clusters of infected persons who seeded infection from areas that had not been designated as high risk, such as the United Kingdom. The relatively high prevalence of A1a and A2a clades in the later-targeted testing group was unsurprising: the targeted testing had been extended to include those who had traveled to additional high-risk areas, and population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform tracking efforts.

    let !m self assert = The A2a3a and A2a2a haplotypes were the two most common haplotypes in Iceland; of the 577 persons who provided samples that were sequenced, the A2a3a haplotype was found in 78 (13.5%) and the A2a2a haplotype was found in 45 (7.8%).

    let !n self assert = Haplotype analysis that was based on SARS-CoV-2 sequences overlaid on contact-tracing networks showed concordance between the contacts identified by the tracking team and those based on viral sequences. Of the 369 pairs of persons found through contact tracing, 295 were consistent with the sequence data (i.e., their haplotypes differed by strictly less than 3 mutations).

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !o self assert = Haplotype analysis of the contact tracing network shows one of the most complex contact-tracing networks, in which clusters of persons returning from Italy or Austria transmitted the virus to persons in Iceland. The figure shows a network of 14 persons who were infected in Iceland. Haplotype analysis showed that these persons were infected by viruses with the A2a1 haplotype, more commonly imported from northern Italy than from Austria. This cluster also contained persons with a mutation that was specific to Iceland. The cluster can be traced to a person who had both mutated and wild-type haplotypes; those whom this person infected had only the mutated haplotype. We searched for persons carrying these mutations who were not associated with this cluster and found two who had probably been infected by someone in the cluster through an unknown contact.

    / April, 2020 - The New England Journal of Medicine
    let !p self assert = We categorized exposure into six categories: family, social, tourism (working in the travel industry in Iceland), work (including schools), travel (international), and unknown and observed a shift in the composition of exposures from international travel and social exposure to familial exposure over time.

  article 'Jing_et_al_2020
    head =  SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission.

    >>> Background
      As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive.

    >>> Methods
      Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and theinfectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.

    >>> Results
      A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (≥60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51- 0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.

    >>> Conclusions
      SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.

The longest transmission chain had three subsequent generations from the primary case, which occurred in Panyu district. Five other clusters had two subsequent generations. The reported residential locations of primary and nonprimary cases within the same clusters are mostly identical, but non-household non-primary cases might live far from the primary cases.

A longer incubation periods is associated with a slightly lower, whereas a longer infectious period is associated with a slightly higher, SAR estimate.

In other words, a typical case infected 0.48 individuals on average in Guangzhou, implying an inefficient transmission of the disease under the control measures. The projected local R, had there been no quarantine of cases, was estimated as 0.62 (0.51-0.75). High estimates of projected local R were associated with short incubation and longer infectious periods

These age effects on susceptibility are insensitive to the assumptions about the natural history of disease.

Under the setting of the shortest incubation and infectious periods, the SAR was estimated as 19.3% (95% CI: 15.51-23.86%). The age effects and the relative infectivity of the illness period vs. the incubation period remained qualitatively similar.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !k self assert = We are the first to quantify the infectivity of COVID-19 patients during their incubation period using contact-tracing data, but qualitative evidence has been noted before. In our unpublished analysis of a separate dataset of case clusters in China, the mean serial interval (time between symptom onsets of a primary and a secondary  case) was shorter than the mean incubation period, suggesting that infectivity during the incubation period is not trivial. This finding has a profound implication on prevention and control strategies, e.g., the necessity of testing asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and the importance of wearing facial mask regardless of symptoms in order to curb the pandemic.

    / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
    let !l self assert = We estimated the local reproductive number to be relatively low, around 0.48, which is consistent with the average level of. We projected that, without isolation of cases and their contacts, the local reproductive number would have been about 30% higher to reach 0.62 in our primary analysis setting. This moderate effect of isolation is partly due to high infectivity during the incubation period, that is, many secondary cases had been infected before or shortly after the symptom onset of the primary cases before the primary cases were identified and isolated. This observation also implies that the low reproductive number in Guangzhou possibly resulted more from policies restricting human movement, limiting the number of contacts of COVID-19 cases during their entire infectious period including the incubation period, than from the detection and isolation of cases and close contacts.

    >>> Abstract
      On the 21st of February 2020 a resident of the municipality of Vo, a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.

    head = The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS‐CoV‐2. Disease severity increased with BMI. Obesity is a risk factor for SARS‐CoV‐2 severity requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.

    >>> Objective
      The Covid‐19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America, where obesity is highly prevalent. The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has not been fully documented.

    >>> Methods
      In this retrospective cohort study we analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS‐CoV‐2, in a single French center.

    >>> Results
      Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (p<0.01, Chi square test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (p<0.05) and BMI (p<0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 vs patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 was 7.36 (1.63‐33.14; p=0.02)

    >>> Conclusion
      The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS‐CoV‐2. Disease severity increased with BMI. Obesity is a risk factor for SARS‐CoV‐2 severity requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.

  article 'Wyllie_et_al_2020
    head = The results indicate that using saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection is more sensitive and consistent than using nasopharyngeal swabs. Overall, we demonstrate that saliva should be considered as a reliable sample type to alleviate COVID-19 testing demands.

    >>> Abstract
      Rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is essential for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Moreover, we detected SARS-CoV-2 from the saliva but not the nasopharyngeal swabs from eight matching samples (21%), while we only detected SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs and not saliva from three matched samples (8%). Overall, we found higher SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva than nasopharyngeal swabs from hospital inpatients.

In longitudinal saliva collections from 12 patients, however, there were no instances in which a sample tested negative and was later followed by a positive result. As true negative test results are important for clinicians to track patient improvements and for decisions regarding discharges, our data suggests that saliva is a more consistent sample type than nasopharyngeal swabs for monitoring temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 titers.

Our results suggest that saliva may also be an appropriate, and perhaps more sensitive, alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for screening asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. however, a larger sample size is needed to confirm.

    head = A purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc) confers complete protection in non-human primates against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide by eliciting potent humoral responses devoid of immunopathology

    >>> Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has brought about an unprecedented crisis, taking a heavy toll on human health, lives as well as the global economy. There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3μg or 6 μg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.

These samples were examined by an N-gene-specific quantitative RT-PCR assay, as described elsewhere.  The viral loads in throat swab and sputum samples peaked at around 5–6 days after symptom onset, ranging from around 104 to 107 copies per mL during this time. This pattern of changes in viral load is distinct from the one observed in patients with SARS, which normally peaked at around 10 days after onset.

  // Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30090-6
  article 'Cowling_et_al_2020
    head = Our findings suggest that the package of public health interventions (including border entry restrictions, quarantine and isolation of cases and contacts, and population behaviour changes, such as social distancing and personal protective measures) that Hong Kong has implemented since late January, 2020, is associated with reduced spread of COVID-19.

    >>> Background
      A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20–23, Feb 11–14, and March 10–13, 2020.

    >>> Findings
      COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34–53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26–1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70–0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24–43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06–1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68–0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively.

    >>> Interpretation
      Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

  // ISG15 drives immune pathology and respiratory failure during viral infection
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.039321
  article 'Shaabani_et_al_2020
    head = We reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.

    >>> Abstract
      Cytokine storm during respiratory viral infection is an indicator of disease severity and poor prognosis. Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling has been reported to be causal in cytokine storm-associated pathology in several respiratory viral infections, however, the mechanisms by which IFN-I promotes disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that lack of deISGylation during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions, cytokine amplification, lung vascular leakage and death. This pathology requires T cells but not T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18. However, lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- or Usp18C61A mice which were dependent on Isg15. We further mechanistically demonstrate that interrupting the ISGylation/deISGylation circuit increases extracellular levels of ISG15 which is accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation to the lung. Importantly, neutrophil depletion reversed morbidity and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. In summary, we reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.

    let !a self assert = Our study is the first to implicate a pathological role of extracellular ISG15 during viral infection and to report a role for USP18 isopeptidase function in regulating extracellular levels of ISG15 in vivo. Our results demonstrate that proper ISGylation/deISGylation in LysM+ cells regulates extracellular ISG15 levels, and perturbation of this pathway results in lung immune pathology, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent Cl13 infection. Thus, we believe that LysM+ cells are major sources of extracellular ISG15 following persistent LCMV infection.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !c self assert = Dysregulated ISGylation/deISGylation in the absence of USP18 can be causal in aberrant immune inflammation in the lung. This hypothesis is further supported in humans, where ISG15 has been reported to stabilize USP18 and ISG15-null patients exhibit strong IFN-I signaling but display much less severe symptoms than USP18-loss of function patients, suggesting that secreted ISG15 may significantly contribute to symptoms observed in USP18-null patients. Furthermore, if free ISG15 contributes to disease pathogenesis in USP18- null patients, ISG15 levels can have prognostic value in assessing the potential for severe pathological outcomes in Usp18-deficient patients or following viral infections. Moreover, antibody neutralization or pharmacological inhibition of ISG15 signaling may be a viable means to alleviate pathology and mortality in USP18-deficient patients or during viral infection where IFN-I signaling correlates with severe pathological outcomes.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !d self assert = We demonstrate that this accumulation of extracellular ISG15 correlates with augmentation of CXCR4+ neutrophils in the lung and that depletion of neutrophils in Usp18C61A mice following persistent viral infection inhibited lung pathology, cytokine amplification and promoted survival. Importantly, deletion of Isg15 from Usp18C61A mice reduced the accumulation of CXCR4+ neutrophils, lessened lung inflammatory pathology, suppressed cytokine amplification and restored survival.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !e self assert = We report here that IFN-γ is a key player in death of Usp18C61A mice following Cl13 infection, as IFN-γ neutralization was superior at reducing inflammation, morbidity and mortality compared to CD8 T cell depletion.IFN-γ induced by T cells leads to hyper-activation of Usp18C61A neutrophils. In support of this hypothesis, neutralization of IFN-γ reduced BALF levels of MPO and MMP9 in Usp18C61A mice. However, the extent to which neutrophil-T cell crosstalk promotes the inflammatory pathology observed in Usp18C61A mice following Cl13 infection remains incomplete and is an exciting area for future study.

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !f self assert = We report that the respiratory pathology associated with persistent viral infection is CD8 T cell dependent. Although T cell-selective Usp18 deletion does not reproduce lung pathology, elevated cytokine production or mortality, we show that Usp18-deletion in LysM+ cells results in elevated levels of extracellular ISG15 accompanied by cytokine storm, lung pathology and mortality

    / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !g self assert = Results show that mice lacking Usp18 in myeloid cells phenocopy Usp18C61A mice post-Cl13 infection, suggesting that lack of deISGylation in LysM+ cells results in CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology during Cl13 infection.  our results strongly suggest that the excessive immunopathology observed in Usp18C61A mice requires T cells, specifically T cell-produced IFNγ, but is not related to T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18.

    let !h self assert = CXCR4+ neutrophils are found in scenarios of severe lung pathology. Moreover, the fact that neutrophil depletion rescued survival in Usp18C61A mice further demonstrates that the neutrophil population recruited to the lung is causal in promoting the inflammatory pathology, morbidity and mortality observed in Usp18C61A mice following persistent virus infection. The role of neutrophils in mediating pathology during Arenavirus infection has not been studied in detail, and our data suggest that neutrophils may play a causal role in disease warranting further investigations in humans and animal models of Arenavirus infection.

  # Hydroxychloroquine
  // No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060699
  article 'Mahevas_et_al_2020
    head = We report a comparative study that uses real-world data collected from routine care to assess the efficacy and safety of HCQ in a population of 181 patients hospitalised for COVID19 hypoxemic pneumonia. We found that HCQ treatment at 600 mg/day added to standard of care was not associated with a reduction of admissions to ICUs or death 7 days after hospital admission, compared to standard of care alone. The rate of ARDS did not decrease either.

    >>> Background
      Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention because of positive results from small studies.

    >>> Method
      We used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen ≥ 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

    >>> Results
      This study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%) experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation.

    >>> Interpretation
       These results do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for documented SARS-CoV-2-positive hypoxic pneumonia.

    head = We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression. Our data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.


    >>> Abstract
      Background. The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Findings. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd March; one further sample was reactive in an anti-spike ELISA. Interpretation. Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to 2-3 weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. Finally, it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals seroconvert and become reactive in the assays used. Serial follow up studies are needed to track infection and seroconversion in this and other similar populations However, these data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

    >>> Abstract
      Due to urgency and demand, numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoassays are rapidly being developed and placed on the market with limited validation on clinical samples. Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or non-coronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90%, 90%, and 65%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics > Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech > Artron Laboratories > Acro Biotech ≥ Hangzhou Alltest Biotech. Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.

Overall, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA had superior sensitivity and specificity compared to both Euroimmun IgA and IgG ELISAs.

    / April, 2020 - medRxiv
    let !b self assert = The differences between the assays may, in part, be explained by the SARS-CoV-2 antigen targeted and the ELISA format used. Both kits detect antibodies to the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; however, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA only targets the RBD within the S1. The RBD represents approximately 33% of the S1 subunit, thus epitopes that may be recognized by cross-reacting epitopes outside of this domain are absent.

    / April, 2020 - medRxiv
    let !c self assert =  Furthermore, the RBD is highly diverse between SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses (hCoVOC43 and hCoV-HKU1), which may further reduce the likelihood of cross-reaction with these circulating coronaviruses. Moreover, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA uses an antigen-antibody-antigen(peroxidase) format whereas the Euroimmun ELISAs employ an antigen-antibody-antibody(peroxidase) format. The specificity of the former is determined by a single antibody, whereas the latter has a second antibody that may introduce additional specificities. The antigen-antibody-antibody format is required to distinguish between specific antibody types, but may not necessarily have lead to decreased specificity as shown for in-house ELISA

    let !d self assert = The clinical sensitivity of IgM for early diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently unclear. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM does not consistently appear before its IgG counterpart, with some studies reporting detection of SARS-CoV 2 spike protein-specific IgG before IgM.  While all the POC tests evaluated in this study are capable of detecting both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, the majority detected both antibody types simultaneously, even in the early convalescent phase, while some detected only IgG and others only IgM.

    / April, 2020 - medRxiv
    let !e self assert = Since the appearance of antibodies is time dependent, diagnosis of COVID-19 by serological methods is limited to patients with a longer duration of illness. Within seven days of symptom onset or in the acute phase of disease, nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples is superior to antibody detection for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, after eight days of illness, the sensitivity of serological assays surpasses that of nucleic acid testing. Here we reported a 100% seropositivity in patients 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

    >>> Abstract
      Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.

No severe adverse effects were observed.One of the risks during CP therapy is antibody-dependent infection enhancement, occurring at subneutralizing concentrations, which could suppress innate antiviral systems and thus could allow logarithmic intracellular growth of the virus.No such pulmonary injury and infection enhancement were observed in our patients, probably owing to high levels of neutralizing antibodies, timely transfusion, and appropriate plasma volume.

    >>> Background
      A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.

    >>> Methods
      Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

    >>> Results
      Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

    >>> Conclusions
      The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317134
  article 'Zhang_et_al_2020f
    head = Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.

    >>> Rationale:
      Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is a major concern for clinicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with hypertension.
    >>> Objective:
      To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
    >>> Methods and Results:
      This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to nine hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. Unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (3.7% vs. 9.8%; P = 0.01). In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; P =0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared to use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01) in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
    >>> Conclusions:
      Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.

    >>> Abstract
      Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy, the difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2 has not been analyzed. Coagulation results and clinical features of consecutive patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 (COVID group) and non-SARS-CoV2 (non-COVID group) in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed and compared. Whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated. There were 449 COVID patients and 104 non-COVID patients enrolled into the study. The 28-day mortality in COVID group was approximately twofold of mortality in non-COVID group (29.8% vs. 15.4%, P = 0.003), COVID group were older (65.1 ± 12.0 vs. 58.4 ± 18.0, years, P < 0.001) and with higher platelet count (215 ± 100 vs. 188 ± 98, ×109/L, P = 0.015), comparing to non-COVID group. The 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In COVID group with D-dimer > 3.0 μg/mL (32.8% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.017). Patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-SARS-CoV2, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant treatment.

    let !a self assert = We show that prophylactic and therapeutic EIDD-2801 significantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in mouse models of both SARS- and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Although the improvement in both SARS- and MERS-CoV outcomes diminished with the delay of treatment initiation time, it is important to note that the kinetics of disease in mice are compressed as compared to that in humans.

    let !b self assert =  In primary human lung cell cultures and mice infected with MERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely correlated with a reduction in infectious virus. We also found a positive correlation between increased mutation rates and the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations and the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. These data strongly support the notion that EIDD-2801 and its active nucleoside analog NHC exert their antiviral effect through the induction of error catastrophe in the targeted virus.

    let !c self assert = While our data suggest that the MERS-CoV nsp14 proofreading activity appeared ineffective against NHC in vitro and EIDD-2801 in vivo, future studies should investigate the antiviral activity of NHC in the presence or absence of the nsp14 proofreading activity, as loss of this activity increased the sensitivity of MHV and SARS-CoV replication to RDV treatment.

    let !d self assert = NHC is broadly active against multiple genetically distinct viruses including VEE, influenza A and B, Ebola, and Chikungunya viruses. For VEE and influenza, NHC/EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leading to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that surpasses the error threshold allowed to sustain a virus population. This process occurs when NHC is incorporated during RNA synthesis then subsequently misread thus increasing mutation rates.

    head = We drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.
