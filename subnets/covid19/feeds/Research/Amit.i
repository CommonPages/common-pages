  // Low-cost measurement of facemask efficacy for filtering expelled droplets during speech
  doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abd3083
  ref 'fischer_et_al_08_2020
    head = Mandates for mask use in public during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, worsened by global shortage of commercial supplies, have led to widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives. It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have demonstrated a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech. In proof-of-principle studies, we compared a variety of commonly available mask types and observed that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck fleece or bandanas, offer very little protection. Our measurement setup is inexpensive and can be built and operated by non-experts, allowing for rapid evaluation of mask performance during speech, sneezing, or coughing.

    let !a self assert = The premise of protection from infected persons wearing a mask is simple: wearing a face mask will reduce the spread of respiratory droplets containing viruses.
    let !b self assert = Speaking through some masks (particularly the neck fleece) seemed to disperse the largest droplets into a multitude of smaller droplets and considering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive
    let !c self assert = rhe performance of the valved N95 mask is likely affected by the exhalation valve, which opens for strong outwards airflow. While the valve does not compromise the protection of the wearer, it can decrease protection of persons surrounding the wearer.

  // The Evolution of the Surgical Mask: Filtering Efficiency Versus Effectiveness
  doi: https://doi.org/10.2307/30141964
  ref 'belkin_1997
    head = When originally introduced for use at the turn of the century, the primary function of the surgical mask was to prevent the migration of microorganisms residing in the nose and mouth of members of the operating team to the open wound of the patient. As technology developed new materials and designs, their filtering efficiencies gradually improved. However, there is no standard test method for assessing that capability, and its influence on the rates of surgical-wound infection has yet to be demonstrated. Quite to the contrary, both in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicate that a mask may not be universally necessary in today's surgical environment.

      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks
      let !b self assert = People who develop symptoms appear to have higher viral loads on or just prior to the day of symptom onset, relative to later on in their infection.
      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - medical professionals
      let !c self assert = To be fully effective, continuous wearing of a medical mask by health workers, throughout their entire shift, should be implemented along with other measures to reinforce frequent hand hygiene and physical distancing among health workers in shared and crowded places where mask use may be unfeasible such as cafeterias, dressing rooms, etc.
      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - disadvantages
      let !d self assert = self-contamination due to the manipulation of the mask by contaminated hands; potential self-contamination that can occur if medical masks are not changed when wet, soiled or damaged; possible development of facial skin lesions, irritant dermatitis or worsening acne, when used frequently for long hours;• masks may be uncomfortable to wear; false sense of security, leading to potentially less adherence to well recognized preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene; risk of droplet transmission and of splashes to the eyes if mask wearing is not combined with eye protection; disadvantages for or difficulty wearing them by specific vulnerable populations such as those with mental health disorders, developmental disabilities, the deaf and hard of hearing community, and children; difficulty wearing them in hot and humid environments.
      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - layers of clothing
      let !e self assert = Fabric cloths (e.g., nylon blends and 100% polyester) when folded into two layers, provides 2-5 times increased filtration efficiency compared to a single layer of the same cloth, and filtration efficiency increases 2-7 times if it is folded into 4 layers.(75) Masks made of cotton handkerchiefs alone should consist of at least 4 layers, but have achieved only 13% filtration efficiency.(73) Very porous materials, such as gauze, even with multiple layers will not provide sufficient filtration; only 3% filtration efficiency.
      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - number and type of layers
      let !f self assert = A minimum of three layers is required for non-medical masks, depending on the fabric used. Choose water-absorbing (hydrophilic) materials or fabrics for the internal layers, to readily absorb droplets, combined with an external synthetic material that does not easily absorb liquid (hydrophobic).
      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - mask maintainance
      let !g self assert = Masks should only be used by one person. All masks should be changed if wet or visibly soiled; a wet mask should not be worn for an extended period of time. Remove the mask without touching the front of the mask, do not touch the eyes or mouth after mask removal. Either discard the mask or place it in a sealable bag where it is kept until it can be washed and cleaned. Perform hand hygiene immediately afterwards. Non-medical masks should be washed frequently and handled carefully, so as not to contaminate other items.

      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - mask washing

      let !h self assert =  Wash in warm hot water, 60°C, with soap or laundry detergent. Where hot water is not available, wash mask with soap/detergent at room temperature water, followed by either i) boiling mask for one minute OR ii) soak mask in 0.1% chlorine for one minute then thoroughly rinse mask with room temperature water, to avoid any toxic residual of chlorine.
      / WHO advisory on use of Facemasks - who should wear a masks

      let !i self assert = Health workers when not performing (Aerosol generating procedures) AGPs should wear medical mask, when performing AGP should wear a respirator. Suspected Covid 19 or person with mild symptoms should wear a medical mask as much as possible; the mask should be changed at least once daily. Persons who cannot tolerate a medical mask should rigorously apply respiratory hygiene. Caregivers or those who are sharing living space with suspected COVID-19 person wear a medical mask when in the same room as the affected person;


    // Effectiveness of facemasks to reduce exposure hazards for airborne infections among general populations
    doi: 10.1098/rsif.2011.0537
    ref 'lai_et_al_2012
      head = Facemasks are widely used as a protective measure by general public to prevent inhalation of airborne pathogens including seasonal, swine and other forms of influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc. However, scientific data on effectiveness of facemasks in reducing infections in the community are extremely limited and even inconsistent. In this work, two manikins labelled as ‘source’ and ‘susceptible’ were used to measure the protection provided by facemasks under various emission scenarios. The facemask was challenged by both pseudo-steady and highly transient emissions generated by an expiratory process where parameters, such as separation distance between manikins, emission velocity and expiratory duration, were controlled and measured systematically. It was also observed that the separation between the source and the manikin was the most influential parameter affecting facemask protection.

      let !a self assert =  It was observed that fully sealed facemasks provide the highest protection, while the least protective was the normal wearing. It was also observed that the reduction of exposure decreases with increasing emission velocity and emission duration, and with decreasing separation distance between source and susceptible manikins.

      head = Typical surgical masks and N95 respirators used in Hong Kong hospitals were tested in comparison with those treated with nano‐functional materials (called nano‐masks) on various physical properties and in‐vivo wear filtration efficiency, as well as usability test in hospitals for surgical masks. Tests on physical properties showed that N95 respirators had significantly lower air permeability and water vapor permeability than surgical masks. The in‐vivo filtration tests illustrated that N95 respirators filtered out 97% of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95% of KCl solution. Nano‐masks show stronger water repellency and antibacterial activities, but no difference in usability, comparing with normal N95 and surgical masks.

    ref 'sande_et_al_2008
      head = We assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators, surgical masks and home-made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient. All types of masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable over time, unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity, but with a high degree of individual variation. Personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. Regardless of mask type, children were less well protected. Outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers).

    ref 'balazy_et_al_2006
      head = The performance of 2 types of N95 half-mask, filtering face piece respirators and 2 types of surgical masks were determined. The collection efficiency of these respiratory protection devices was investigated using MS2 virus (a nonharmful simulant of several pathogens). The virions were detected in the particle size range of 10 to 80 nm. The results indicate that the penetration of virions through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 respirators can exceed an expected level of 5%. As anticipated, the tested surgical masks showed a much higher particle penetration because they are known to be less efficient than the N95 respirators.

Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.
      let !b self assert = It should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the environment from the wearer, whereas the respirators are supposed to protect the wearer from the environment.

    ref 'syed_et_al_2003
      head = SARS has been called the first global epidemic of the 21st century and has been the cause of a massive and varied public health response in many countries of the world.  Though of uncertain protective benefit, the wearing of masks may have contributed to the awareness of the collective and personal responsibility in combating infectious disease. Active and empowered involvement of the general public in implementing and cooperating with public health control measures supported by national and international authorities has clearly helped to bring SARS under control. The public health significance of such potent symbols as the face mask may be considered in strategies to tackle other emerging infections.

Active and empowered involvement of the general public in implementing and cooperating with public health control measures supported by national and international authorities has clearly helped to bring SARS under control. Perhaps it is this perception of the importance of personal and collective responsibility by members of the public that the mask symbolises best and the public health contribution of this symbolism should be remembered for future emerging infections.

      head = Many countries are stockpiling face masks for use as a nonpharmaceutical intervention to control virus transmission during an influenza pandemic. We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non–fit-tested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. Mask use adherence was self-reported. We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease. However, during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced. Many countries are stockpiling face masks for use as nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce viral transmission during an influenza pandemic.

Henceforth, facemasks’ “therapeutic” role against SARS-CoV-2 must be explored because personal “therapeutic” environments may get created under facemasks due to rebreathing of ~95°F “hot” and ~80% “humid” exhalations which may constantly mitigate SARS-CoV-2 inside nasal cavity, oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity and upper airways.

Universal adoption will likely slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus by reducing transmission from asymptomatic individuals. We provide strongly suggestive evidence from cross-country data that facemask use slows the growth rate of cases and deaths. This complements extant scientific data on mask usage. Our analysis suggests each cloth facemask generates thousands of dollars in value from reduced mortality risk. Each medical mask, when used by a healthcare worker, may generate millions of dollars in value, and policies to encourage greater production prioritized for health workers are urgently needed.
