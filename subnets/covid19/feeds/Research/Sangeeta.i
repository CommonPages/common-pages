    >>> Abstract
      The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world, representing a global pandemic, counting, as of June 5th, 2020, over 6,600,000 confirmed cases and more than 390,000 deaths, with exponentially increasing numbers. In the first half of 2020, because of the widespread of the COVID-19, researches were focused on the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in water, wastewater, sludge, air, and on surfaces, in order to assess the risk of contracting the viral infection from contaminated environments. So far, the survival of the novel Coronavirus out of the human body has been reported for short time periods (from hours to few days, in optimized in vitro conditions), mainly because of the need of an host organism which could consent the viral attack, and due to the weak external membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding strategies in the environment, either through animate and unanimate matrices, or exploiting the organic matter in water, wastewater, and waste in general, have been discussed in the present article. We concluded that, besides the high infectuousness of the novel Coronavirus, the transmission of the pathogen may be efficiently contained applying the adequate preventive measures (e.g., personal protection equipments, and disinfecting agents), indicated by national and international health authories.

  / Evidence of Airborne Transmission of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus.
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa032867
  ref 'Xiao_et_al_02_20_2020
    head =

    >>> BACKGROUND
      There is uncertainty about the mode of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of cases in a large community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and examined the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume that was modeled using studies of airflow dynamics.

    >>> METHODS
      We determined the distribution of the initial 187 cases of SARS in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003 according to the date of onset and location of residence. We then studied the association between the location (building, floor, and direction the apartment unit faced) and the probability of infection using logistic regression. The spread of the airborne, virus-laden aerosols generated by the index patient was modeled with the use of airflow-dynamics studies, including studies performed with the use of computational fluid-dynamics and multizone modeling.

    >>> RESULTS
      The curves of the epidemic suggested a common source of the outbreak. All but 5 patients lived in seven buildings (A to G), and the index patient and more than half the other patients with SARS (99 patients) lived in building E. Residents of the floors at the middle and upper levels in building E were at a significantly higher risk than residents on lower floors; this finding is consistent with a rising plume of contaminated warm air in the air shaft generated from a middle-level apartment unit. The risks for the different units matched the virus concentrations predicted with the use of multizone modeling. The distribution of risk in buildings B, C, and D corresponded well with the three-dimensional spread of virus-laden aerosols predicted with the use of computational fluid-dynamics modeling.

    >>> CONCLUSIONS
      Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.

    >>> Abstract
      A novel β-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal–oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Here we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071134
  ref 'Fontanet_et_al_04_23_2020
    head = The relatively low infection attack rate (IAR) (25.9%) observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures and the low prevalence of antibodies among blood donors in the vicinity indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.


    >>> Background
      The Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020.

    >>> Methods
      Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among
      pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

    >>> Findings
      Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 - 2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since midJanuary were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 –9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2 – 23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1 - 6.4).

    >>> Interpretation
      The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.

  / Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, March 2020
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01615-9
  ref 'Tariq_et_al_02_20_2020
    head = 18 different clusters of COVID19 cases with 2–48 cases per cluster have been reported in Singapore (Medical store, hotel, restaurant, construction site, office space, church, gym). Our current findings point to temporary sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number lying below 1.02.

    >>> Background
      As of March 31, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in December 2019 is now generating local transmission around the world. The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued.

    >>> Methods
      Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts.

    >>> Results
      The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p < 0.001).

    >>> Conclusion
      The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.

  ref 'Shim_et_al_03_17_2020
    head = We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5. Our results indicate an early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.

    >>> Objectives
      Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.

    >>> Methods
      The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.

    >>> Results
      We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.

    >>> Conclusions
      Our results indicate an early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.

    >>> Abstract
      We report the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 across different settings from the initial COVID-19 cluster in Brunei, arisen from 19 attendees at the Malaysian Tablighi Jama′at gathering and resulted in 52 locally transmitted cases. Highest non-primary attack rates(ARs) were observed at a subsequent local religious gathering (14.8% [95%CI: 7.1,27.7]) and in the household (10.6% [95%CI: 7.3,15.1]. Household ARs of symptomatic cases were higher (14.4% [95%CI: 8.8,19.9]) than asymptomatic (4.4% [95%CI: 0.0,10.5]) or presymptomatic cases (6.1% [95%CI: 0.3,11.8]). Low ARs (<1%) were observed for workplace and social settings. Our analysis highlights that SARS-CoV-2 transmission varies depending on environmental, behavioural and host factors. We identify ′red flags′ of potential super-spreading events, namely densely populated gatherings for prolonged periods in enclosed settings, presence of individuals with recent travel history, and group behaviours such as communal eating, sleeping and sharing of personal hygiene facilities. We propose differentiated testing strategies that account for transmission risk.

    head = We used a household cohort study to determine the features of household transmission of COVID-19. Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). Age of household contacts and spousal relationship to the index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a household.

    >>> Background
      Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has extended to most parts of China with >80 000 cases and to at least 100 countries with >60 000 international cases as of 15 March 2020. Here we used a household cohort study to determine the features of household transmission of COVID-19.

    >>> Methods
      A total of 105 index patients and 392 household contacts were enrolled. Both index patients and household members were tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Information on all recruited individuals was extracted from medical records and confirmed or supplemented by telephone interviews. The baseline characteristics of index cases and contact patients were described. Secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 to contact members were computed and the risk factors for transmission within the household were estimated.

    >>> Results
      Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). The secondary attack rate to children was 4% compared with 17.1% for adults. The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since onset of symptoms was 0% compared with 16.9% for contacts without quarantined index patients. The secondary attack rate to contacts who were spouses of index cases was 27.8% compared with 17.3% for other adult members in the households.

    >>> Conclusions
      The secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in household is 16.3%. Age of household contacts and spousal relationship to the index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a household. Quarantine of index patients at home since onset of symptoms is useful to prevent the transmission of SARS-Co-2 within a household.

Our results indicate that an additional exhaust outlet below the breathing zone can control high particle concentrations in the breathing zone.

    >>> Abstract
      Most ventilation and air conditioning systems are designed without much concern about how
      settling particles behave in ventilation air flows. For displacement ventilation systems,
      designers normally assume that all pollutants follow the buoyant air flow into an upper zone,
      where they are evacuated. This is, however, not always true. Previous studies show that high
      concentrations of settling respirable particles can be found in the breathing zone, and that the exposure rates can be a health hazard to occupants. The emphasis here is on how ventilation systems should be designed to minimise respirable airborne particles in the breathing zone. The supply and exhaust conditions of the ventilation air flow are shown to play an important role in the control of air quality. Computer simulation programs of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) type are used. Particle concentrations, thermal conditions and modified ventilation system solutions are reported.

    >>> Abstract
      The outbreak and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused an emergency in the health system worldwide. After a first development in Wuhan, China, the virus spread in other countries, with Italy registering the second highest number of cases in Europe on the 7th of April 2020 (135,586 in total). The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients’ entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed. COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.

The qualitative data by analyzing several indicators suggests that there is a higher individual efficacy over collective efficacy among the police force. Further, the long-time fight against Covid-19 had drained police force mentally and physically and this put them in higher risk.

    >>> Conclusion
      Immediate priority interventions like provision of protective gears need to be provided by the government to control the risk of infection among police.

    >>> Abstract
      The practice of social distancing and wearing masks has been popular worldwide in combating the contraction of COVID-19. Undeniably, although such practices help control the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent, the complete control of virus-laden droplet and aerosol transmission by such practices is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a cough-jet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible. Hence, clearly defined, science-based administrative, clinical, and physical measures are of paramount importance to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic from the world.

      Restrictions on the use of public space and social distancing have been key policy measures to reduce the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 and protect public health. At the time of writing, one half of the world’s population has been asked to stay home and avoid many public places. What will be the long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public space once the restrictions have been lifted? The depth and extent of transformation is unclear, especially as it relates to the future design, use and perceptions of public space. This article aims to highlight emerging questions at the interface of COVID-19 and city design. It is possible that the COVID-19 crisis may fundamentally change our relationship with public space. In the ensuing months and years, it will be critical to study and measure these changes in order to inform urban planning and design in a post-COVID-19 world.

    head = The exact pathophysiology of ocular transmission of the virus remains incompletely understood, although there is preliminary evidence of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in ocular secretions. Ocular surface manifestations such as conjunctivitis are more commonly reported.

    >>> Purpose
      The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has reached pandemic proportions within an unprecedented span of time. It is controversial whether the virus can be transmitted via tears and its ocular implications have not been widely studied. In this article, the current evidence related to ocular transmission and ocular manifestations is reviewed.

    >>> Results
      Several mechanisms for the ocular transmission of the virus are proposed with highlight on the nasolacrimal system as a conduit between the eye and the respiratory tract, and the role of the lacrimal gland in hematogenous spread. Ocular surface manifestations such as conjunctivitis are more commonly reported.

    >>> Conclusion
      The exact pathophysiology of ocular transmission of the virus remains incompletely understood, although there is preliminary evidence of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in ocular secretions. The ocular tropism of the virus and its potential to cause localized ocular disease are worth considering.

  ref 'Andrade_et_al_11_02_2017
    head = Studies that examined the association between air quality and health demonstrated the negative effects of pollution. The concentration of indoor pollutants was higher than that of outdoor pollutants. During physical exercise, air quality is influenced by human occupation and the intensity of exercise.

    >>> Background
      Systematic reviews have the potential to contribute substantially to environmental health and risk assessment.

    >>> Objective
      This study aimed to investigate indoor air quality of environments used for physical exercise and sports practice through a systematic review.

    >>> Methods
      The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and was recorded in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42016036057). The search was performed using the SciELO, Science Direct, Scopus, LILACS, MEDLINE via PubMed, and SPORTDiscus databases, from their inception through April 2017. The search terms used in the databases were (air pollution” OR “air pollutants” OR “air quality”) AND (“physical exercise” OR “physical activity” OR “sport”). The results of selected studies were divided into 5 categories for analysis: monitoring of air quality in the environment according to international guidelines, indoor-to-outdoor ratio (I/O), air quality during physical exercise, impact of air quality on health, and interventions to improve indoor air quality.

    >>> Results
      Among 1281 studies screened, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. The monitoring of pollutants was conducted in 20 studies. CO and NO2 were the most investigated pollutants, and guidelines were discussed in most studies. The I/O ratio was investigated in 12 studies, of which 9 showed a higher concentration of some pollutants in indoor rather than outdoor environments. Among the 34 studies selected, only 7 investigated the impact of indoor air pollution on human health. The population in most of these studies consisted of hockey players.

    >>> Conclusion
      Most studies conducted monitoring of pollutants in indoor environments used for physical exercise and sports practice. The earliest studies were conducted in ice skating rinks and the most recent evaluated gymnasiums, fitness centers, and sports centers. The CO, particulate matter, and NO2 concentrations were the most investigated and have the longest history of investigation. These pollutants were within the limits established by guidelines in most studies. Studies that examined the association between air quality documented the adverse effects of pollution. There is a need for more studies focused on the relationship between pollution and health.

  ref 'Murphy_et_al_06_21_2008
    head = This study used an established mouse model of short-term of severe exercise training and respiratory infection to examine the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to influenza virus. The results indicates that 3 days of exhaustive exercise on a treadmill can result in an increase in susceptibility to influenza virus.

    >>> Abstract
      Exercise stress is associated with an increased risk for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) while moderate exercise has been associated with a decreased risk. We have shown that exercise stress can increase susceptibility (morbidity, symptom severity and mortality) to HSV-1 respiratory infection, but there is little evidence on the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to the principal etiological agents of human respiratory infections, including influenza viruses. This study examined the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to influenza virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)). Mice were assigned to one of two groups: exercise (Ex) or control (Con). Exercise consisted of a treadmill run to volitional fatigue ( approximately 120 min) performed on three consecutive days. Fifteen minutes after the last bout of exercise or rest, mice (n=20-21/group) were intranasally inoculated with a standardized dose of influenza virus (0.25 HAU). Mice were monitored daily for morbidity (time to sickness), symptom severity and mortality (time to death) for 21 days. Exercise stress was associated with an increase in susceptibility to infection (morbidity, mortality and symptom severity on days 6 and 7; P<0.05). These data from a controlled influenza virus challenge model add significantly to the growing body of evidence that severe exercise can increase susceptibility to URTI.

  ref 'Carlisle_et_al_02_20_2020
    head = The respiratory physiology of exercise suggests that athletes and other exercisers may experience magnified exposure to ambient air pollution.

    >>> Objectives
      To establish by literature survey: (a) levels at which air pollutants are considered damaging to human health and to exercisers in particular; (b) the current ambient levels experienced in the United Kingdom; (c) whether athletes are especially at risk.

    >>> Methods
      Six major urban air pollutants were examined: carbon monoxide (CO); nitrogen oxides (NOX); ozone (O3); particulate matter (PM10); sulphur dioxide (SO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

    >>> Results
      CO is detrimental to athletic performance. NO2 is of concern to human health, but outdoor levels are low. O3 poses a potentially serious risk to exercising athletes. Decrements in lung function result from exposure, and there is evidence that athletic performance may be affected. Detrimental effects may occur at low ambient levels, but there is no scientific consensus on this matter. PM10 is causing concern in the scientific community. Blood lead accumulation during exercise indicates that personal exposure to toxic compounds associated with PM10 may be magnified. Generally, outdoor ambient levels of SO2 are too low to cause a problem to the athlete, except the asthmatic athlete. The few studies on exposure of exercisers to VOCs are reviewed.

    >>> Conclusions
      Athletes and exercisers should avoid exercising by the road side even though levels of the more noxious air pollutants have been controlled in the United Kingdom. O3 is particularly damaging to athletes; it reaches its highest concentrations on hot bright days in rural areas.

    >>> Abstract
      The ultimate aim of sustainability in buildings gained an additional new dimension as the start of the year 2020 saw a rapid worldwide spread of the infectious disease caused by a coronavirus named COVID-19. There is evidence that, in addition to person to person contact, the disease transmission occurs through airborne droplets/aerosols generated by breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. For that reason, building heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems can play an important role, as they may both contribute as well as reduce the transmission risk. However, there is insufficient understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings. This article introduces a method of bottom-up emergent modelling of the movement of infectious aerosols in internal space using a physics engine, and reports on simple simulation experiments. The results show that the smallest droplets that are large enough to contain the virus can be suspended in the air for an extended period of time; that turbulent air flow can contribute to the infectious aerosols remaining in the room; and that unidirectional air flow can contribute to purging the room of the infectious aerosols. The model introduced in this article is a starting point for further development and for increasing our understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings, and thus for increased sustainability of building design.

    >>> Abstract
      Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19. Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content. Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.

    head = Our finding has confirmed the aerosol transmission as an important pathway for surface contamination. Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

    >>> Background
      The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.

    >>> Methods
      Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.

    >>> Results
      The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.

    >>> Conclusions
      Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

    head = Based on the theoretical knowledge from computational fluid dynamics, aerosol science and ventilation inbuilt environment technology, we wish to draw the hypothesis to Middle Eastern countries that PM emissions due to indoor burning of incense, poor building ventilation and low indoor temperature may increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

    >>> Abstract
      Majority of countries across the globe have employed improving building ventilation, quarantine, social distancing, and disinfections as a general measure of preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions. However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM10; aerodynamic diameter <10 μm) and fine (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments. In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings. It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.

      With the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal, state, county, and city governments, universities, school districts, places of worship, prisons, health care facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares, homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission through built environment (BE)-mediated pathways. Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.

  // Airborne Transmission Route of COVID-19: Why 2 Meters/6 Feet of Inter-Personal Distance Could Not Be Enough
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082932
  ref 'Setti_et_al_04_23_2020
    head = The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks.

    >>> Abstract
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world. In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.

  # cluster transmission, transmission, settings
  // What settings have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters?
  doi: https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15889.2
  ref 'Leclerc_et_al_06_05_2020
    head = In this review, we found that clusters of cases were reported in many, predominantly indoor settings (such as hospitals and elderly care, large religious gatherings, food processing plants, schools, shopping, and worker dormitories, prisons and ships, weddings, sport, bar). The majority of our reports are from China and Singapore.

    >>> Background
      Concern about the health impact of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in widespread enforced reductions in people’s movement (“lockdowns”). However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these “exit strategies” entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures.

    >>> Methods
      We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database.

    >>> Results
      We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe.

    >>> Conclusions
      We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.

    let !a self assert = Large clusters, such as those linked to churches and ships, were infrequently reported. Almost all clusters involved fewer than 100 cases (181/201), with the outliers being transmission in hospitals, elderly care, worker dormitories, food processing plants, prisons, schools, shopping and ship settings. Religious venues provided a further setting with large cluster sizes: there were separate clusters in South Korea, France, India and Malaysia

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !b self assert = In addition to these settings with maximum cluster sizes of more than 100 cases per cluster, we identified five further settings with maximum cluster sizes between 50 and 100: sport (65 cases) (Korean Centre for Diease Control & Prevention, 2020), bar (80 cases) (Sim, 2020), wedding (98 cases) (Ministry of Health – New Zealand, 2020), work (97 cases) (Park et al., 2020) and conference (89 cases) (Marcelo & O'brien, 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !c self assert = We found a notably high number of transmission events reported in worker dormitories (21/201), although all of these were from Singapore. This type of setting had the second highest total cluster size out of all the recorded events we found, with 797 cases reported in the S11 dormitory cluster in Singapore (Data Against COVID19 SG, 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !d self assert = We found only a small number of clusters linked to schools (8/201), and there the SARS-CoV-2 cases reported were most often in teachers or other staff. For example, for two school clusters in Singapore (Ministry of Health - Singapore, 2020), 16/26 and 7/8 cases were staff. Some children were also found to be infected in these clusters, as was the case in the Salanter Akiba Riverdale school in New York, USA (Ailworth & Berzon (2020)), although testing for infection was not always universal. In a retrospective close cohort study in a French high school however, 133 children and staff were seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 92 of whom were pupils (Fontanet et al., 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !e self assert = We identified 9 clusters linked to food processing plants in 4 different countries (USA, Germany, Canada, Netherlands). These transmission events have led to large clusters, such as in a meat processing plant in South Dakota where a total of 518 employees were infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Cannon, 2020).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !f self assert = The setting with the greatest number of reported clusters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was households (36/201). Again, most were from China (25/36) with all cluster sizes being less than 10. However, for 27 out of 36 studies, we were unable to calculate either the secondary or final attack rates due to a lack of information on total household size.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !g self assert = One type of setting that was associated with large numbers of eventual cases was religious venues. The common features of these meetings are the large number of attendees, confined spaces and physical contact. For example, there were eventually more than 5000 COVID-19 cases linked to transmission at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in South Korea (Shin et al., 2020). In this particular religious venue, no preventative action was taken despite knowing members were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In other venues, transmission events took place without prior knowledge of any infections and before the WHO declared pandemic status.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !h self assert = Other large clusters in this setting type were associated with annual religious events that took place over a few days or weeks (Ananthalakshmi & Sipalan, 2020; BBC, 2020; Salaün, 2020). Attendees returned to their home countries where they continued to transmit. This generated many secondary cases internationally as well as locally.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !i self assert = However, it is clear from smaller “first-generation” clusters, which our analysis focuses on, that these settings provide ideal conditions for transmission: we found 7/16 identified religious clusters had 10 cases or less, whilst 9/16 had 23 or more. The number of cases in each cluster is an approximation, and little is known about the number of index cases in these religious meetings to begin with, with the exception of the South Korea cluster. Religious events are well known sources of heightened transmission; there is a focus on vaccination recommendations for attendees to the annual Hajj pilgrimage for example, which is currently being postponed for 2020.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !j self assert = Worker dormitories have been recognised as key places linked to transmission in Singapore, with 893 out of 942 new cases recorded on April 18th being residents in such dormitories (Asia, 2020). We found 21 reported clusters, one of which had the second largest cluster size of all the events we report here; 797 cases which from the data we believe is a first-generation cluster

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !k self assert = These points also apply to prisons, another type of large co-habiting setting for which we have identified 4 clusters with a maximum cluster size of 353 cases.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !l self assert = In addition to religious events and worker homes, we also identified clusters of more than 100 cases in elderly care homes, hospitals and ships.

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !m self assert = We identified seven additional setting types with cluster sizes above 50 or 100 cases (school, sport, bar, shopping, wedding, work and conference), which shared characteristics with the settings described above. Notably, sport, bars, shopping areas and conferences are predominantly indoor settings, where people are in close proximity. For conferences and work, like religious events, transmission within the cluster is facilitated by the duration of the events over several days, as well as the combination of interactions there (workshops, dinners etc…).

    / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
    let !n self assert = This can also apply to weddings, where transmission is further increased due to the close-proximity interactions between people (kissing, hugging, dancing etc…). As for bars and shopping areas, these are places with important fluxes of people, which increases the diversity of contacts. Finally, schools, like religious groups, can sometimes represent tightly knit communities which facilitates disease transmission amongst individuals, as was the case with the Salanter Akiba Riverdale school in New York, with a cluster size of at least 60 cases

The increase of walking speed could effectively reduce the overall number of suspended droplets, which may have a positive impact on releasing the infection risk of health workers in airborne infection isolation room (AIIR).

    >>> Abstract
      This paper introduces a numerical simulation model for investigating the influence of moving subjects on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets, rather than on the dispersion of surrogate gaseous counterparts generally adopted in related research works. In our work, the Lagrangian discrete trajectory model is used for tracing the motion of droplets, the Eulerian RANS method is used for solving the airflow field, and the dynamic mesh model for describing the human movement. The model validation was performed through result comparisons with published data from literatures. A case study on the influence of human walking on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) is then presented. Our findings show that the human walking disturbs the local velocity field with wake formation. The increase of walking speed could effectively reduce the overall number of suspended droplets, which may have a positive impact on releasing the infection risk of health workers in AIIR.

    >>> Abstract
      After the emergence of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), many exposure and environmental health scientists promptly recognized the potentially catastrophic public health ramifications of concurrent infectious and air pollution-mediated disease. Nevertheless, much of this attention has been focused on outdoor interactions. Each year, 3.8 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to indoor air. Hence, poor household indoor air quality is a long-standing public health issue with even greater relevance now that many individuals are spending more time at home. At present, the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate indoor air, and state-level legislation has resulted in a patchwork of national coverage. Here, we describe common sources of indoor air pollution, the health impacts of indoor pollutants, and populations disparately impacted by COVID-19 and poor indoor air quality. Furthermore, we detail the need for better legislation that promotes the integrity of the indoor air environment, and what individuals can do to personally protect themselves as we await more comprehensive indoor air legislation.

    head = During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19, we collected air and surface samples. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination around COVID-19 patients is extensive, and hospital IPC procedures should account for the risk of fomite, and potentially airborne, transmission of the virus.

    >>> Abstract
      The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019, and its resulting coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 represents perhaps the most significant public health emergency in a century. As the pandemic progressed, a continued paucity of evidence on routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has resulted in shifting infection prevention and control guidelines between classically-defined airborne and droplet precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, we collected air and surface samples to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. We detected viral contamination among all samples, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients.

    >>> Abstract
      Since December 2019, COVID-19, a new emerging infection disease, has spread in 27 countries and regions. The clusters of many cases were reported with the epidemic progresses. We collected currently available information for 377 COVID-19 clusters (1 719 cases), excluded the hospital clusters and Hubei cases, during the period from January 1 to February 20, 2020. There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median was 4; 39 clusters of dining (10%), case median was 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case median was 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median was 6, and 6 clusters of transportation. We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and its range was 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days. The analysis of the epidemic situation in a department store in China indicated that there was a possibility of patients as the source of infection during the incubation period of the epidemic. From February 5 to 21, 2020, 634 persons were infected on the Diamond Princess Liner. All persons are susceptible to the 2019 coronavirus. Age, patients during the incubation period and the worse environment might be the cause of the cases rising. The progress of the two typical outbreaks clearly demonstrated the spread of the early cases in Wuhan. In conclusion, screening and isolating close contacts remained essential other than clinical treatment during the epidemic. Especially for the healthy people in the epidemic area, isolation was the key.

    >>> Aim
      This study aims to reveal more data on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, Zhejiang, China.

    >>> Design
      This study was a retrospective case series.

    >>> Methods
      Eighty-eight cases of laboratory-confirmed and three cases of clinically confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020.

    >>> Results and discussion
      Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2, three (3.30%) cases were clinically diagnosed. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5–57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample, 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the disease from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, eight (8.79%) patients had contacted with people from Wuhan, and 11 (12.09%) patients were diagnosed after having flown together in the same flight with no passenger that could later be identified as the source of infection. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (interquartile range 3–8) days and the median time from the first visit to a doctor to the confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1–2) days. According to the chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.

    >>> Conclusions
      Social activity cluster, family cluster and flying alongside with persons already infected with COVID-19 were how people got infected with COVID-19 in Zhejiang.

    >>> Abstract
      Commissioned by the Minister of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan, we collected secondary transmission data with the aim of identifying high risk transmission settings. We show that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environments are consistent with large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital-associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease. Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help prevent large case clusters and superspreading events.

    >>> Abstract
      Over 1 billion people currently live in slums, with the number of slum dwellers only expected to grow in the coming decades. The vast majority of slums are located in and around urban centres in the less economically developed countries, which are also experiencing greater rates of urbanization compared with more developed countries. This rapid rate of urbanization is cause for significant concern given that many of these countries often lack the ability to provide the infrastructure (e.g., roads and affordable housing) and basic services (e.g., water and sanitation) to provide adequately for the increasing influx of people into cities. While research on slums has been ongoing, such work has mainly focused on one of three constructs: exploring the socio-economic and policy issues; exploring the physical characteristics; and, lastly, those modelling slums. This paper reviews these lines of research and argues that while each is valuable, there is a need for a more holistic approach for studying slums to truly understand them. By synthesizing the social and physical constructs, this paper provides a more holistic synthesis of the problem, which can potentially lead to a deeper understanding and, consequently, better approaches for tackling the challenge of slums at the local, national and regional scales.

  ref 'Riley_et_al_03_07_2007
    head = Continued neglect of ever-expanding urban slum populations could inevitably lead to greater expenditure and diversion of health care resources to the management of end-stage complications of diseases that are preventable.

    >>> Background
      Urban slums, like refugee communities, comprise a social cluster that engenders a distinct set of health problems. With 1 billion people currently estimated to live in such communities, this neglected population has become a major reservoir for a wide spectrum of health conditions that the formal health sector must deal with.

    >>> Discussion
      Unlike what occurs with refugee populations, the formal health sector becomes aware of the health problems of slum populations relatively late in the course of their illnesses. As such, the formal health sector inevitably deals with the severe and end-stage complications of these diseases at a substantially greater cost than what it costs to manage non-slum community populations. Because of the informal nature of slum settlements, and cultural, social, and behavioral factors unique to the slum populations, little is known about the spectrum, burden, and determinants of illnesses in these communities that give rise to these complications, especially of those diseases that are chronic but preventable. In this article, we discuss observations made in one slum community of 58,000 people in Salvador, the third largest city in Brazil, to highlight the existence of a spectrum and burden of chronic illnesses not likely to be detected by the formal sector health services until they result in complications or death. Lack of health-related data from slums could lead to inappropriate and unrealistic allocation of health care resources by the public and private providers. Similar misassumptions and misallocations are likely to exist in other nations with large urban slum populations.

    >>> Summary
      Continued neglect of ever-expanding urban slum populations in the world could inevitably lead to greater expenditure and diversion of health care resources to the management of end-stage complications of diseases that are preventable. A new approach to health assessment and characterization of social-cluster determinants of health in urban slums is urgently needed.

The response will need to include national and local governments, bilateral and multi-lateral international agencies, CBOs, NGOs, and foundations. Necessary training, outreach and all proposed interventions must uphold human rights laws.


    >>> Abstract
      The informal settlements of the Global South are the least prepared for the pandemic of COVID-19 since basic needs such as water, toilets, sewers, drainage, waste collection, and secure and adequate housing are already in short supply or non-existent. Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.

    head = The aim of this review was to summarize findings in the field of infectious diseases with a variety of pathogens associated with international MGs in the last 5 years.

    >>> Purpose of Review
      Mass gatherings (MGs) are characterized by a high concentration of people at a specific time and location. Infectious diseases are of particular concern at MGs. The aim of this review was to summarize findings in the field of infectious diseases with a variety of pathogens associated with international MGs in the last 5 years.

    >>> Recent Findings
      In the context of Hajj, one of the largest religious MGs at Mecca, Saudi Arabia, respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of infectious diseases in pilgrims with a prevalence of 50–93%. The most commonly acquired respiratory viruses were human rhinovirus, followed by human coronaviruses and influenza A virus, in decreasing order. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria. The prevalence of Hajj-related diarrhea ranged from 1.1 to 23.3% and etiologies included Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli, with evidence of acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In other MGs such as Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, sports events, and large-scale open-air festivals, outbreaks have been reported less frequently. The most common outbreaks at these events involved diseases preventable by vaccination, notably measles and influenza. Gastrointestinal infections caused by a variety of pathogens were also recorded.

    >>> Summary
      Because social distancing and contact avoidance are difficult measures to implement in the context of many MGs, individual preventive measures including vaccination, use of face mask, disposable handkerchief and hand hygiene may be recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures has been poorly investigated in the context of MGs.

    >>> Abstract
      From January 1993 through February 1995, CDC and state health departments completed investigations of six instances in which passengers or flight crew traveled on commercial aircraft while infectious with tuberculosis (TB). All six of these investigations involved symptomatic TB patients with acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive cavitary pulmonary TB, who were highly infectious at the time of the flight(s). In two instances, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from the index patients was resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; organisms isolated from other cases were susceptible to all antituberculous medications. In addition, in two instances, the index patients were aware of their TB at the time of travel and were in transit to the United States to obtain medical care. However, in none of six instances were the airlines aware of the TB in these passengers. This report summarizes the investigations by CDC and state health departments and provides guidance about notification of passengers and flight crew if an exposure to TB occurs during travel on commercial aircraft.

  ref 'Kenyon_et_al_04_11_1996
    head = The transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that we describe aboard a commercial aircraft involved a highly infectious passenger, a long flight, and close proximity of contacts to the index patient.

    >>> BACKGROUND
      In April 1994, a passenger with infectious multidrug-resistant tuberculosis traveled on commercial-airline flights from Honolulu to Chicago and from Chicago to Baltimore and returned one month later. We sought to determine whether she had infected any of her contacts on this extensive trip.

    >>> METHODS
      Passengers and crew were identified from airline records and were notified of their exposure, asked to complete a questionnaire, and screened by tuberculin skin tests.

    >>> RESULTS
      Of the 925 people on the airplanes, 802 (86.7 percent) responded. All 11 contacts with positive tuberculin skin tests who were on the April flights and 2 of 3 contacts with positive tests who were on the Baltimore-to-Chicago flight in May had other risk factors for tuberculosis. More contacts on the final, 8.75-hour flight from Chicago to Honolulu had positive skin tests than those on the other three flights (6 percent, as compared with 2.3, 3.8, and 2.8 percent). Of 15 contacts with positive tests on the May flight from Chicago to Honolulu, 6 (4 with skin-test conversions) had no other risk factors; all 6 had sat in the same section of the plane as the index patient (P = 0.001). Passengers seated within two rows of the index patient were more likely to have positive tuberculin skin tests than those in the rest of the section (4 of 13, or 30.8 percent, vs. 2 of 55, or 3.6 percent; rate ratio, 8.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 41.3; P = 0.01).

    >>> CONCLUSIONS
      The transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that we describe aboard a commercial aircraft involved a highly infectious passenger, a long flight, and close proximity of contacts to the index patient.

    head = We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness.

    >>> BACKGROUND
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.

    >>> METHODS
      We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.

    >>> RESULTS
      After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.

    >>> CONCLUSIONS
      Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.

    head = This study examined indoor air quality and environmental issues related to physical exercise performed at gyms. Inefficient ventilation in gyms is a significant problem, with high CO2 concentrations resulting in impaired air quality and high health risks to users.


    >>> Abstract
      This study aimed to analyze the risk of infection (influenza and tuberculosis) for individuals participating in physical exercise. This was achieved by assessment of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and examination of the physical characteristics of a number of gyms to determine whether there was a relationship to CO2 levels. This study was performed in three different gyms ventilated with either split system or central system air conditioners. The risk of airborne infection (percent of susceptible persons infected) was estimated for each gym using the Wells-Riley model. The risk of infection increased during periods of peak occupancy where the ventilation required by occupants was greater. In each gym, the highest risk of infection occurred during the evening where occupancy and CO2 levels were high. The infection risk for influenza was high in all situations due to the high quantum generation rate for this agent. This study suggests that inefficient ventilation in gyms is a significant problem, with high CO2 concentrations resulting in impaired air quality and high health risks to users, including increased risk of infections such as influenza and tuberculosis.

      We describe the epidemiology of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in a call center in South Korea. We obtained information on demographic characteristics by using standardized epidemiologic investigation forms. We performed descriptive analyses and reported the results as frequencies and proportions for categoric variables. Of 1,143 persons who were tested for COVID-19, a total of 97 (8.5%, 95% CI 7.0%–10.3%) had confirmed cases. Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5% (95% CI 36.9%–50.4%). The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2% (95% CI 11.6%– 22.0%). Of the 97 persons with confirmed COVID-19, only 4 (1.9%) remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine, and none of their household contacts acquired secondary infections. Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings.
