  head = These findings show that even though baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing human ACE2 cells support full-length clade 1 spike entry, just having the RBD from a clade 1 virus was insufficient to mediate efficient entry. As seen in our experiments, protease treatment did not enhance pseudotype entry in the absence of host receptor. It alsoo confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.

  >>> Abstract
    Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.

Introducing all 14 ACE2 contact points in clade 2 or 3 also failed to restore ACE2 entry (2 → 1 and 3 → 1 (version 2)).

  head = Our studies should encourage further efforts in developing either pan-serine protease inhibitors or inhibitor cocktails to target SARS-CoV2 and potentially ward off future pandemics that could develop because of additional mutations in the S-protein priming sequence in coronaviruses.

  >>> Abstract
    Processing of certain viral proteins and bacterial toxins by host serine proteases is a frequent and critical step in virulence. The coronavirus spike glycoprotein contains three (S1, S2, and S2′) cleavage sites that are processed by human host proteases. The exact nature of these cleavage sites, and their respective processing proteases, can determine whether the virus can cross species and the level of pathogenicity. Recent comparisons of the genomes of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV, with less pathogenic strains (e.g., Bat-RaTG13, the bat homologue of SARS-CoV2) identified possible mutations in the receptor binding domain and in the S1 and S2′ cleavage sites of their spike glycoprotein. However, there remains some confusion on the relative roles of the possible serine proteases involved for priming. Using anthrax toxin as a model system, we show that in vivo inhibition of priming by pan-active serine protease inhibitors can be effective at suppressing toxicity. Hence, our studies should encourage further efforts in developing either pan-serine protease inhibitors or inhibitor cocktails to target SARS-CoV2 and potentially ward off future pandemics that could develop because of additional mutations in the S-protein priming sequence in coronaviruses.

  # let !a self assert = The pathogenic coronaviruses appear to contain a furin consensus motif in either the S1 or S2′ sites. While cleavage preferences of TMPRSS2 and other TMPRs are less defined compared to furin, their common consensus motifs follow the order R↓K > R↓R >> R↓X. These simple motifs are the result of the small size of the TMPRSS2 binding site, nearly identical to that of trypsin, compared with the larger binding pocket of furin.

  # / May, 2020 - Molecules
  # let !b self assert = Mapping these putative TMPRSS2 cleavage sites in the S1 and S2′ sequences revealed that SARS-CoV2, in contrast with other strains, acquired both a furin and an additional TMPRSS2 efficient cleavage site. Indeed, trypsin efficiently cleaves both the SARS-CoV2 S1 and S2′ peptides, although the first is more rapidly processed, likely due to the RR pair in its sequence.

  / May, 2020 - Molecules
  let !c self assert = These observations suggest that both proteases can efficiently and uniquely cleave the S1 site of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2. Because TMPRSS2 is abundant in the lungs while furin is more ubiquitously expressed in other organs, we speculate that the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 may be due to this acquired increased tropism. However, furin is also present intracellularly and may contribute to cleaving the S1 site at the viral egress. This could contribute to the delivery of already pre-primed viral particles that could then more readily infect other cells and organs and/or spread more easily from host to host.

  let !d self assert = Using the three-dimensional structure of furin in complex with the irreversible inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK we derived a reversible pan-serine protease inhibitor, compound 1, that can potently inhibit furin (IC50 9 nM) and hPC1/3 (IC50 3 nM). Given that hPC1/3 and furin share similar cleavage preferences, it may be advantageous, if not necessary, for any inhibitor to target both human proteases. Compound 1 is also likely a moderate inhibitor of TMPRSS2 simply based on its RR mimicking motif.

  let !e self assert = Using trypsin as model enzyme (40% identity with TMPRSS2 in the catalytic domain and >90% identical in their binding sites), compound 1 can inhibit this enzyme at 10 µM. Conversely, the potent and irreversible TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat is a poor furin inhibitor

  let !f self assert = Similar to LF/PA anthrax toxin, SARS-CoV infects macrophages, as well as the airway epithelium. Hence, we monitored the ability of compound 1 to protect RAW macrophages from LF/PA-induced cell death. The agent protected RAW macrophages in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 in the low micromolar range indicating a robust cellular inhibition of various possible PA-activating serine proteases, including furin and, potentially, also TMPRSS2.

  # let !g self assert = We then conducted preliminary ADME studies to assess the drug-like properties of selected agents to anticipate their use in vivo. To this end, we measured solubility (in PBS buffer, pH = 7.2, T = 25 °C, compound 1 is soluble at concentrations greater than 1 mM), plasma stability (>86% intact after 60 min incubation), and cell permeability (LogPe = −5.7; PAMPA method)

In our experiments, a lethal dose of LF (100 µg) and PA (100 µg) anthrax toxins is administered I.V. in Balb/C mice. Using the toxemia rescue model, we designed an experiment in which groups were also injected with either a single dose 3mg/kg (I.P.) of compound 1, or two doses spaced by 2 h, or with vehicle control. All mice in the untreated group perished in roughly 33 h, in agreement with the published studies with this model, while a remarkable and significant increase in both median survival time (MST) and time to death (TTD) was observed in both groups treated with compound 1.

  / May, 2020 - Molecules
  let !i self assert = However, while the S2 site is conserved among various coronavirus strains, the S1 site in SARS-CoV2 contains a furin cleavage site. Most intriguingly, the unusual SARS-CoV2 S1 site may have also acquired an increased cleavage propensity for TMPRSS2. This may explain why TMPRSS2 appeared more important than furin for the entry of the surrogate SARS-CoV2 viral particles in cell.

  # / May, 2020 - Molecules
  # let !j self assert = However, while TMPRSS2 is abundant in the respiratory tract, furin is more ubiquitously found in many other organs; hence, acquisition of a furin cleavage site most likely increases the tropism and the pathogenicity of the strain.

  # / May, 2020 - Molecules
  # let !j self assert = The common mechanisms of cell trafficking mediated by furin cleavage by both viral fusion proteins and bacterial toxins is striking. For example, anthrax toxin, similar to SARS-CoV2, requires processing of the PA sequence RKKRST to chaperone the internalization of the LF toxin into macrophages. Intriguingly, much like the S1 of SARS-CoV2, the PA cleavage site also contains both furin-like and TMPRSS2-like proteases recognition sites, and it also invades macrophages, making a potentially good model system to study inhibition of priming in vivo.

  / May, 2020 - Molecules
  let !k self assert = These data clearly suggest that at least for anthrax toxin and likely for other pathogens including SARS-CoV2, furin-targeting pan protease inhibitors could be used as antiviral agents or be deployed prophylactically in emergency medicine in case of pandemic outbreaks in patients that are suspected or at risk of viral infection.

  let !l self assert = Systemic administration of the inhibitors in the treated group was tolerated by mice at 3 mg/kg doses, but a maximum tolerated dose of about 10–15 mg/kg was observed in separate toxicity studies, suggesting that more targeted delivery strategies may improve the observed therapeutic window. Similar to other antiviral drugs such as Zanamivir, this could be perhaps simply accomplished by devising proper inhalable formulations, which should be facilitated by the high aqueous solubility of the agents (>1 mM).

  / May, 2020 - Molecules
  let !m self assert = Recently, camostat mesylate, a covalent TMPRSS2 inhibitor already clinically approved for other indications in Japan, has been proposed given that it partially blocked viral entry in surrogate cellular assays. However, we found that camostat mesylate did not appreciably inhibit furin, and while it may attenuate entry at relatively high concentrations (10–50 µM), in our opinion it would do little to prevent furin-mediated egress of partially primed (at S1 site), hence more virulent, SARS-CoV2 viral particles.

Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-α.

  >>> Abstract
    Molecular mimicry is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to exploit the host cellular machinery. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in the striking mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (ENaC-α). Genetic alteration of ENaC-α causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting that the FURIN site is critical for activation of ENaC. Single cell RNA-seq from 66 studies shows significant overlap between expression of ENaC-α and the viral receptor ACE2 in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular characterization with cleavage signatures of 178 proteases highlights proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-α, a protein critical for the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, whose misregulation is associated with respiratory conditions.

Although the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence identity with the S proteins of Pangolin-CoV (92%) and Bat-CoV RaTG13 (97%), the furin insertion site seems to be uniquely acquired by SARS-CoV-2.

The location of this SARS-CoV-2 mimicked peptide in the ENaC-ɑ structure is in the extracellular domain. This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 may have specifically evolved to mimic a human protease substrate.

  # / May, 2020 - eLife Sciences
  # let !d self assert = It is conceivable that human ENaC activation may be compromised in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, for instance by SARS-CoV-2 exploiting host FURIN for its own activation. The likely consequence would be low ENaC activity on the surface of the airways leading to compromised fluid reabsorption, an important lung pathology in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Indeed, the exact mechanism of SARS-CoV-2’s potential impact of ENaC activation needs to be investigated.

  # / May, 2020 - eLife Sciences
  # let !e self assert = Systematic single cell expression profiling of the ACE2 receptor and ENaC-ɑ was performed across human and mouse samples comprising ~1.3 million cells. Interestingly, ENaC-ɑ is expressed in the nasal epithelial cells, typse II alveolar cells of the lungs, tongue keratinocytes, and colon enterocytes, which are all implicated in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Further, ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ are known to be expressed generally in the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells. The overlap of the cell-types expressing ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ, and similar spatial distributions at the apical surfaces, suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be leveraging the protease network responsible for ENaC cleavage.

  # let !g self assert = This analysis shows that FURIN is expressed with ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ in the colon (immature enterocytes, transit amplifying cells) and pancreas (ductal cells, acinar cells) of human tissues, as well as tongue (keratinocytes) of mouse tissues. PCSK5 and PCSK7 are broadly expressed across multiple cell types with ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ, making it a plausible broad-spectrum protease that may cleave the S1/S2 site.

  # let !h self assert = In humans, concomitant with ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ, PCSK6 appears to be expressed in cells from the intestines, pancreas, and lungs, whereas PCSK2 is noted to be co-expressed in the pancreas. It is worth noting that the extracellular proteases need not necessarily be expressed in the same cells as ACE2 and ENaC-ɑ.

  head = We report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

  >>> Summary
    The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

In contrast, entry into TMPRSS2− Vero cells, which is known to be cathepsin B/L dependent, was not affected by these mutations.

Finally, alterations of the S1/S2 site of SARS-S did not augment entry efficiency. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a multibasic S1/S2 site is essential for SARS-2-S-driven entry into human lung cells while a monobasic site is sufficient for SARS-S.

After discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No statistically significant differences in mortality or improvement in the day-15 disease severity was observed when the study was suspended.

  >>> Background
    After recovery from COVID-19, most patients have anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19.

  >>> Methods
    The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15.

  >>> Results
    The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care.

  >>> Conclusion
    Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

For this, the PRNT50 titers on day 7 were compared with the titers on day 1 in the subgroup of patients with a titer <1:160 at baseline. In all 9 patients, including 5 randomized to standard of care, a fourfold increase in titers was observed on day 7.

// A New Method for Sampling and Detection of Exhaled Respiratory Virus Aerosols

ref 'Huynh_et_al_01_01_2008
  head = This small study is the first to report direct detection of virus aerosols exhaled by infected individuals. It reveals that breathing alone, for some people, is sufficient to aerosolize rhinovirus. In summary, we have revealed that a simple mask-like device can be used to sample exhaled respiratory bioaerosols for analysis by PCR.

  >>> Abstract
    We have developed a mask sampler for exhaled respiratory viruses. Among a group of 9 patients with cold symptoms who had virus-positive nasal mucus specimens, as analyzed by multiplexed polymerase chain reaction, virus-positive mask samples were obtained after coughing (20 times), talking (20 min), or breathing (20 min) from 6, 5, and 3 patients, respectively.

// Exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis output and detection of subclinical disease by face-mask sampling: prospective observational studies
doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30707-8
ref 'Williams_et_al_02_18_2020
  head = We have shown that over a 24-h sampling period, applied to patients with established sputum-positive disease, M tuberculosis is detected at least four times more frequently with face masks than in sputum samples. Moreover, we have shown the clinical effect of this increased level of detection in which face-mask sampling achieved microbiological diagnosis of active tuberculosis from one sample up to 6 weeks before conventional sputum diagnosis, providing scope to interrupt possible transmission at an earlier stage of disease.

  >>> Background
    Tuberculosis remains a global health challenge, with early diagnosis key to its reduction. Face-mask sampling detects exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We aimed to investigate bacillary output from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and to assess the potential of face-mask sampling as a diagnostic method in active case-finding.

  >>> Methods
    We did a 24-h longitudinal study in patients from three hospitals in Pretoria, South Africa, with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients underwent 1 h of face-mask sampling eight times over a 24-h period, with contemporaneous sputum sampling. M tuberculosis was detected by quantitative PCR. We also did an active case-finding pilot study in inhabitants of an informal settlement near Pretoria. We enrolled individuals with symptoms of tuberculosis on the WHO screening questionnaire. Participants provided sputum and face-mask samples that were tested with the molecular assay Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. Sputum-negative and face-mask-positive individuals were followed up prospectively for 20 weeks by bronchoscopy, PET-CT, and further sputum analysis to validate the diagnosis.

  >>> Findings
    Between Sept 22, 2015, and Dec 3, 2015, 78 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were screened for the longitudinal study, of whom 24 completed the study (20 had HIV co-infection). M tuberculosis was detected in 166 (86%) of 192 face-mask samples and 38 (21%) of 184 assessable sputum samples obtained over a 24-h period. Exhaled M tuberculosis output showed no diurnal pattern and did not associate with cough frequency, sputum bacillary content, or chest radiographic disease severity. On May 16, 2018, 45 individuals were screened for the prospective active case-finding pilot study, of whom 20 had tuberculosis symptoms and were willing to take part. Eight participants were diagnosed prospectively with pulmonary tuberculosis, of whom six were exclusively face-mask positive at screening. Four of these participants (three of whom were HIV-positive) had normal findings on chest radiography but had treatment-responsive early tuberculosis-compatible lesions on PET-CT scans, with Xpert-positive sputum samples after 6 weeks.

  >>> Interpretation
    Face-mask sampling offers a highly efficient and non-invasive method for detecting exhaled M tuberculosis, informing the presence of active infection both with greater consistency and at an earlier disease stage than with sputum samples. The approach shows potential for diagnosis and screening, particularly in difficult-to-reach communities.

By contrast, a similar proportion of patients in our cohort were identified as high variable producers, generating both the highest peak and total M tuberculosis output. These observations support the view that transmission risk between patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is heterogeneous.

In 2008, Huynh et al., developed a novel prototype mask-like sampling device. It was made from impermeable and stretchable PVC. It contained an electret (25-mm diameter) opposite the nose and mouth region. This sampling device had low airflow resistance (15 mmH2O) at normal respiratory flows and was able to collect 80% of 0.52-µm latex particles (virus droplet representative). Hence, after sampling, electret can be easily removed, placed in RNA lysis buffer and PCR can be performed.

  / July, 2020 - Clinical Microbiology and Infection
  let !b self assert = In a recent study by Williams et al.,face-mask sampling offered an efficient and non-invasive method for detection of exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a high sensitivity of 86·5%. In this simple technique, the person wears a face mask containing strips made of a gelatin sampling matrix for a duration of 30 minutes. These moist strips will trap the virus in the matrix and can then be preserved after drying out and used for virus isolation. The preserved strips can be directly transported to the laboratory, precluding the need for special storage before analysis. This method obviates the need for health-care workers, and no expertise is required to collect the samples

  / July, 2020 - Clinical Microbiology and Infection
  let !c self assert = The major limitation of this method is that it is patient-dependent. Non-compliance in a claustrophobic patient can limit the sensitivity of detection. Another concern is the storage of samples. An NP swab in Viral Transport Medium can be refrigerated at 2°C–8°C for 48 hours and at –70°C for a longer duration and has a shelf life of 5 years. Storage and shelf life of the mask with gelatin strips warrants more studies.

  head = Although the viruses identified may have been noninfectious, health care workers should be aware that SARS coronavirus can contaminate environmental surfaces in the hospital, and fomites should be considered to be a possible mode of transmission of SARS.

  >>> Background
    Health care workers continued to contract severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), even after barrier precautions were widely implemented.

  >>> Methods
    We explored the possible contribution of contaminated hospital surfaces to SARS transmission by swabbing surfaces in 2 hospitals and testing the swab samples by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture.

  >>> Results
    Twenty-six of 94 swab samples tested positive for viral RNA. Swab samples of respiratory secretions from each of the 4 patients examined tested positive by RT-PCR, as were 12 of 43 swabs from patient rooms and 10 of 47 swabs from other parts of the hospital, including the computer mouses at 2 nursing stations and the handrail of the public elevator. Specimens from areas with patients with SARS in the most infectious phase of illness (days 5–15 after onset) were more likely to be RNA positive than were swab specimens from elsewhere (24 of 63 samples vs. 2 of 31 samples; P = .001). All cultures showed no growth.

  >>> Conclusions
    Although the viruses identified may have been noninfectious, health care workers should be aware that SARS coronavirus can contaminate environmental surfaces in the hospital, and fomites should be considered to be a possible mode of transmission of SARS.

doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2720-9
ref 'Sharma_et_al_07_08_2020
  head = We have presented the data, suggesting that the BCG immunization correlates with lower incidence and gravity of the COVID-19 disease across different countries, even when the BCG immunization was performed in childhood. The literature on CQ and HCQ has so far exclusively dealt in therapeutic role in  advanced stages. We have instead emphasized the possible chemoprophylactic role of CQ and HCQ: even if the evidence for it is admittedly only circumstantial.

  >>> Abstract
    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the light of its rapid global spreading, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Interestingly, the global spreading of the disease is not uniform, but has so far left some countries relatively less affected. The reason(s) for this anomalous behavior are not fully understood, but distinct hypotheses have been proposed. Here we discuss the plausibility of two of them: the universal vaccination with Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) and the widespread use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ). Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful. The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination. We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse. Taken together, the data in the literature have led to the suggestion of a possible inverse correlation between BCG immunization and COVID-19 disease incidence and severity.

As five different strains of BCG were employed in different countries, we analyzed their correlative efficacy in protecting against COVID-19. Our data have shown that mixed and JAPAN strains seem superior to the DANISH strain.

  # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  # let !c self assert = BCG exhibits efficacy against disseminated TB and meningitis in childhood26,27; currently, ~100 million children are vaccinated every year worldwide. However, the vaccine exhibits poor efficacy against adult pulmonary TB and several countries have, therefore, discontinued BCG immunization. Subsequently, BCG was shown to exhibit protective effects against leprosy, buruli ulcer, and several other diseases, including those not associated with mycobacteria. BCG is a potent immunomodulator, especially of the cell-mediated immunity, and is employed for the treatment of cancers such as that of the bladder. It is actually being tested for several other cancers. Recently, BCG was shown to exhibit efficacy against type I diabetes. This was first shown in mice in Edmonton in 1993, which also partially protects against sepsis and respiratory infections when given following early infection.

  / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  let !a self assert = The results show that countries without a universal BCG policy (such as Belgium, Italy, the United States, and the Netherlands) have increased incidence of COVID-19 (2810.9 ± 497.1 (mean ± SEM) per million) compared with countries with ongoing national BCG policy (570.9 ± 155.6 (mean ± SEM) per million). The incidence for countries that discontinued BCG vaccination was intermediate between these two groups (1844.67 ± 508.89 (mean ± SEM) per million).

  # let !f self assert = This type of analysis does not reflect the true impact of BCG against COVID-19. For example, a country with a higher percentage of population of elderly people may report more deaths than a country with a relatively younger population, simply because of increased comorbidities that worsen disease severity. Unfortunately, not enough public data are available to analyze the impact of such confounding factors.

  # let !g self assert = The results represent the distribution of disease incidence among different age groups for the three different types of countries, indicating three significant features as follows: (i) the disease incidence is very low for subjects <15 years of age and does not show significant dependence on the presence or absence of universal BCG vaccination policies. This is possibly due to high resistance of young people to symptomatic disease. (ii) The number of infected cases across the age groups is always higher for countries without universal BCG vaccination policy. (iii) The differences between countries with universal BCG vaccine policy and countries without such a policy increase and reach their peak for age groups 45–64 and 65–79 years. The difference in the number of confirmed cases in these age groups is ~550–600 per million of the population between countries with vs. without universal BCG vaccination policy.

  # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease

  # let !j self assert = The results show that the distribution of fatal cases per million of people across different age groups for countries without mass vaccination and countries with discontinued mass vaccination are not significantly different (p = 0.41, Mann–Whitney U-test). With increasing age, the death toll increases for countries without or discontinued BCG vaccination programs. In comparison, the mortality is quite consistent and rises only slightly in the elderly population. Differences in the death toll between countries with or without a national BCG program thus suggest that BCG has a role in lowering the COVID-19 casualty by manifold.

  # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  # let !k self assert = Although our results indicate a correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 progression/mortality, one should also note that the confirmed cases to death ratio varies widely among the countries analyzed. This might be due to different strains of BCG used in these countries for an induced trained immunity.

  / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  let !c self assert = We found that countries adopting a mixture of different strains of the BCG vaccine such as South Korea and the Philippines reported a lower number of confirmed and fatal cases. The BCG-Denmark and BCG-Russia strains correlated poorly in terms of limiting the COVID-19 spread and casualty. Taken together, the bulk of the data of the analysis appear to be compatible with a correlation between BCG vaccination and susceptibility to COVID-19 disease.

  / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  let !d self assert = To this end, a discussion related to certain countries, which have performed very differently compared with other countries is essential. One such example is Brazil. Even if it is a country with universal BCG vaccination policy, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is the highest among the countries with similar vaccination strategy. This could be due to the use of the BCG-Brazil strain, which has been found ineffective against COVID-19.

  / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  let !e self assert = The case of Russia is probably similar, as the BCG strain used in Russia is probably also not effective against the coronavirus. A country that has done extremely well in restricting the COVID-19 spread is Australia. Although Australia has dropped its BCG program back in 1985, the number of incident and deaths due to COVID-19 are very low. This could be due to very low population density of Australia, which helped to restrict the spread of the virus effectively.

  / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  let !f self assert = Similarly, the BCG vaccine, which is routinely administered to all newborns in Israel and was administered to immigrants with unknown vaccination records, showed no statistically significant difference in the susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection.

  # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  # let !p self assert = We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic. The possibility that the diffuse use of CQ and HCQ may possibly have a chemoprophylactic role in the populations that have so far been much less affected by the pandemic, e.g., those of most African countries or of India, could not be based on the accurate numerical analyses done for the BCG vaccination. However, although highly circumstantial, it should still be discussed, considering the still very diffuse consumption of CQ by populations in which malaria is still endemic.

  # / July, 2020 - Cell Death & Disease
  # let !q self assert = However, caution should be taken, as observational clinical trials for HCQ in COVID-19 patients was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death also in association with azithromycin and in view of potential toxicity as well. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the negative results of the “Solidarity” international trial on HCQ21 have been indicated to be flawed. In any case, the “therapeutic” effect would not concern the discussion in this contribution, as we are considering its possible prophylactic role.

SL-CoV WIV16 was isolated from a single fecal sample of Rhinolophus sinicus, which was collected in Kunming, Yunnan Province, in July 2013. The full genomic sequence of SL-CoV WIV16 (GenBank accession number KT444582) was determined and contained 30,290 nucleotides (nt) and a poly(A) tail which is slightly larger than those of SARS-CoVs and other bat SL-CoVs.

  / December, 2015 - Journal of Virology
  let !b self assert = The WIV16 genome has a 40.9% G+C content and short untranslated regions (UTRs) of 264 and 339 nt at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. Its gene organization is identical to that of WIV1 and slightly different from that of the civet SARS-CoV and other bat SL-CoVs due to an additional ORF (name ORFx) detected between the ORF6 and ORF7 genes of the WIV1 and WIV16 genomes. The conserved transcriptional regulatory sequence was identified upstream of ORFx, indicating that this is likely to be a potential functional gene.

  let !h self assert = It is worth noting that the WIV16 RBD (amino acids [aa] 318 to 510) has 95% sequence identity to the SARS-CoV RBD but is almost identical to WIV1s. Thus, the WIV16 S gene is likely a recombinant of WIV1s gene and a recent ancestor of SARS-CoVs gene.

  / December, 2015 - Journal of Virology
  let !i self assert = High sequence conservation of the WIV16 RBD with that of SARS-CoVs predicts that WIV16 is likely also to use ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. This was confirmed by infection of HeLa cells expressing ACE2 from human, civet, and Chinese horseshoe bat, respectively. Cell susceptibility testing using different cell lines further indicated that WIV16 has the same host range as WIV1.

  / December, 2015 - Journal of Virology
  let !j self assert = To assess whether the major sequence difference of the S1-NTD will have an effect on virus entry and/or replication, the growth kinetics of the two viruses were comparatively studied. The two viruses grew at very similar rates, with WIV16s rate being slightly lower than WIV1s rate during the 48-h period examined in this study. It is hard to conclude whether this subtle difference is significant and related to the S1-NTD sequence difference. Further investigation with more cell lines is required to confirm this preliminary observation.

  / December, 2015 - Journal of Virology
  let !k self assert = It should be noted that WIV16 is not the closest strain to the human SARS-CoVs with regard to ORF8. Full-length ORF8 is present in several SARS-CoV genomes of early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and bat SL-CoVs. It is split into two ORFs (ORF8a and -b) in most human SARS-CoVs from late-phase patients due to a deletion event in this part of the genome.

Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats will be necessary and important not only for a better understanding of the spillover mechanism but also for more effective risk assessment and prevention of future SARS-like disease outbreaks.

  head = Structural and biochemical data indicate that a bat virus, similar to RaTG13, would not be able to bind effectively to human ACE2 receptor and would be unlikely to infect humans directly. Our observations support the involvement of recombination between distinct coronavirus genomes in the generation of SARS-CoV-2.

  >>> Abstract
    SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have emerged from bats, possibly via a secondary host. Here, we investigate the relationship of spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 with the S protein of a closely related bat virus, RaTG13. We determined cryo-EM structures for RaTG13 S and for both furin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; we compared these with recently reported structures for uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S. We also biochemically characterized their relative stabilities and affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Although the overall structures of human and bat virus S proteins are similar, there are key differences in their properties, including a more stable precleavage form of human S and about 1,000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor. These observations suggest that cleavage at the furin-cleavage site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S and facilitates the adoption of the open conformation that is required for S to bind to the ACE2 receptor.

  let !a self assert = Structure of protease-cleaved SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein: The observation here of a substantially populated (39%) intermediate form, in which one of the RBDs is disordered and two of NTDs have shifted, suggests that this conformation, which is possibly transient, will lead to a receptor-binding-competent form. Thus, we suspect that, in addition to its requirement for membrane fusion, efficient protease cleavage might be selected to ensure there is a higher proportion of S protein on the virus surface that is capable of binding to receptor.

  / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
  let !b self assert = Although the loop containing the cleavage site (residues 676–689) is disordered, in both cleaved and uncleaved forms, the observation of the intermediate form and the much lower thermal stability of the cleaved protein suggest that cleavage reduces the overall stability of S. This reduction in stability may facilitate the movement of the NTDs and the RBDs, enabling, finally, the adoption of the open, receptor-binding-competent form.

  / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
  let !c self assert = Comparison with the S glycoprotein from the bat virus RaTG13: Thermal-stability data show that the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S trimer has a markedly higher stability than the bat virus protein does, whereas the cleaved SARS-CoV-2 has a similar stability to the (uncleaved) bat virus protein. Perhaps the higher stability of SARS-CoV-2 S is required to offset some of the loss of stability that occurs upon cleavage. These structural and biochemical data together suggest that the furin-cleavage site might confer the human virus with an advantage, as the cleavage facilitates a higher proportion of the open, receptor-binding-competent conformation.

  / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
  let !d self assert = Binding of ACE2 to bat virus and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins:. Amplitude analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 S binds approximately 1,000 times more tightly to ACE2 than the bat virus protein does, with Kd values of <100 nM and >40 μM, respectively.

  / July, 2020 - Nature Structural & Molecular Biology
  let !e self assert = Structural comparison also suggests another substitution that likely contributes to the greatly enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S binding to ACE2: Gln493 of S makes a potential hydrogen bond with Glu35 of ACE2, which forms an intramolecular salt bridge with Lys31; in turn, ACE2 Lys31 forms a salt bridge with S Glu484. In contrast, the residue equivalent to SARS-CoV-2 Gln493 in the bat virus S is a tyrosine that is unlikely to bond to ACE2 Glu35, and SARS-CoV-2 Glu484 is replaced by a threonine that would not bond to ACE2 Lys31 (Fig. 3c). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 Gln498 is replaced by a Tyr498 that cannot form a hydrogen bond to ACE2 Tyr41.

  // Analysis of Genetic Host Response Risk Factors in Severe COVID-19 Patients
  doi: https://doi.org/xyz
  ref 'Taylor_et_al_06_20_2020
  head = The variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades, were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. We found many novel targets that are involved in key biological pathways associated with the development of severe COVID-19, including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors.

  >>> Background
    Epidemiological studies indicate that as many as 20% of individuals who test positive for COVID-19 develop severe symptoms that can require hospitalization. These symptoms include low platelet count, severe hypoxia, increased inflammatory cytokines and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, severe COVID-19 is associated with several chronic co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The identification of genetic risk factors that impact differential host responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the development of severe COVID-19, is important in gaining greater understanding into the biological mechanisms underpinning life-threatening responses to the virus. These insights could be used in the identification of high-risk individuals and for the development of treatment strategies for these patients.

  >>> Methods
    As of June 6, 2020, there were 976 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized, indicating they had a severe response to SARS-CoV-2. There were however too few patients with a mild form of COVID-19 to use this cohort as our control population. Instead we used similar control criteria to our previous study looking at shared genetic risk factors between severe COVID-19 and sepsis, selecting controls who had not developed sepsis despite having maximum co-morbidity risk and exposure to sepsis-causing pathogens.

  >>> Results
    Using a combinatorial (high-order epistasis) analysis approach, we identified 68 protein-coding genes that were highly associated with severe COVID-19. At the time of analysis, nine of these genes have been linked to differential response to SARS-CoV-2. We also found many novel targets that are involved in key biological pathways associated with the development of severe COVID-19, including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors.

  >>> Conclusion
    The variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades, were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that such variants are not associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst patients who develop severe COVID-19. Among the 68 severe COVID-19 risk-associated genes, we found several druggable protein targets and pathways. Nine are targeted by drugs that have reached at least Phase I clinical trials, and a further eight have active chemical starting points for novel drug development. Several of these targets were particularly enriched in specific co-morbidities, providing insights into shared pathological mechanisms underlying both the development of severe COVID-19, ARDS and these predisposing co-morbidities. We can use these insights to identify patients who are at greatest risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and develop targeted therapeutic strategies for them, with the aim of improving disease burden and survival rates.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !a self assert = We identified twelve genes that are associated with host immune response to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Variants in several of these genes have been associated with increased infectivity to these strains.

  # / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !d self assert = HOST RESPONSE FACTORS AND INFLAMMATION: From the number of genes we found relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades. These variants were found in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that variants in these genes may not be associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst many patients who develop severe COVID-19.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !b self assert = Our analysis also revealed five genes regulating pro-inflammatory pathways such as necroptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytokine signalling. There were also six genes associated with severe COVID-19 patients that play central roles in lipid droplet biology, as well as having high expression in adipose tissue, correlating with serum lipid levels and coronary artery disease.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !c self assert = HOPX regulates a variety of different cellular processes, including cardiac development and myogenesis. It seems likely that patients who develop severe COVID-19 may have an inherent imbalance in these factors. Similarly, we identified SNP variants in ITK that were highly associated with severe COVID-19. High ITK expression is associated with Th2-driven diseases such as allergic asthma, causing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, eosinophil infiltration and production of mucus.

  # / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !g self assert = Whilst MLKL-induced necrosis may be useful in limiting viral replication, increased necroptosis can also lead to increased inflammation and tissue damage. SNP variants in MLKL could be predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 in one of two ways; with under-functioning protein resulting in poor viral clearance, or through over-expression and over-activation of the necroptotic inflammatory response resulting in organ damage. The SNP variant identified in MLKL was found in the highest scoring 20% of the significant genes in the severe COVID-19 dataset and is present in 251 cases. It is not highly associated with any of the most common co-morbidities found in this dataset.

  # / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !h self assert = In addition, our analysis revealed 12 more genes that may be implicated in the vascular complications seen in COVID-19. These are all highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, modulating cardiac function and endothelial cell homeostasis.

  # / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !i self assert = VASCULAR INFLAMMATION, AUTOPHAGY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION: Many of the risk-associated SNPs that we found that were related to these pathological pathways were found in severe COVID-19 patients who had at least one of these co-morbidities. However, we controlled for this effect by co-morbidity-matching these cases against the sepsis-free controls, meaning that these SNPs are not likely to be just be artefacts of the co-associated comorbidity, but a differentiating factor in the development of severe COVID-19 and ARDS.

  let !d self assert = Our analysis revealed that variants in IZKF2 were disproportionately co-associated with patients with hypertension.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !e self assert = Although more research is required to fully understand the role of MCUB in severe COVID-19 pathogenesis, a decreased level of serum calcium has been suggested as a biomarker for increased COVID-19 severity and ARDS.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !f self assert = High levels of PKCβ result in increased vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, all of which have been found in patients with severe COVID-19.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !g self assert = Our analysis identified CIDEA and a perilipin, PLIN4, as being highly associated with severe COVID-19 patients. SNPs in CIDEA were found in one of the highest proportions in severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in patients with cardiovascular and hypertensive diseases. This indicates that insulin resistance is a contributing factor to vascular inflammatory pathologies that may predispose patients to developing ARDS in response to SARS-CoV-2.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !h self assert = Variants in GFRA1 are within the highest 10% of genes most associated with hypertensive patients in our case population.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !i self assert = Amongst other cancer-associated genes, our analysis identified nine genes that regulate either the Wnt or β-catenin components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Due to the significant number of genes found to regulate this pathway in our analysis, we believe that modulation of this pathway could be of benefit to a large number of patients who develop severe COVID-19. Except for KRAS and SLC9A9, all of the proteins encoded by these genes act as endogenous inhibitors of the pathway.

  # / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !p self assert = NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS: Our analysis identified a strong conserved signal for four genes that also confer greater risk of developing AD, including MAPT, the key gene underlying tau pathology. We also found three additional genes that were significant in a previous neurodegenerative disease study we performed.

  # / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !q self assert = We have also shown that increasing the activity of two of these genes in a mixed cell neuronal assay containing SOD1 reactive astrocytes significantly improves motor neurone survival. This could indicate shared biological pathways that drive both severe COVID-19 and neurodegeneration, potentially through pro-inflammatory, neurotoxic mechanisms. However, the SNP variants found in these genes were not highly enriched in the few severe COVID-19 patients who had been diagnosed with AD. This is likely due to the relatively low numbers of cases diagnosed with AD in UK Biobank as a whole.

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !j self assert = ABO BLOOD-GROUP ASSOCIATION: We found that blood group A was significantly overrepresented in the cases compared to the sepsis-free controls (p=0.037) and all UK Biobank individuals (p=0.096), indicating that it confers a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. On the other hand, blood group O was found in fewer severe COVID-19 cases (p=0.154) than the controls and the UK Biobank as a whole (p=0.05).

  / June, 2020 - MedRxiv
  let !k self assert = CALCIUM SIGNALLING PATHWAY: The gene cluster at 3p21.31 identified as a susceptibility locus for respiratory failure in COVID-19 contains several genes that are involved in calcium ion signalling, which may be responsible for driving severe COVID-19 responses in patients with variants in genes that regulate the expression and activity of this ion.

  # let !u self assert = Out of the total 68 genes, nine are targeted by clinical candidates that have been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and beyond. These could potentially form the basis of repurposing therapies, after evaluating factors such as safety and pharmacology data. A further eight targets have active chemistry in ChEMBL57, meaning they have active chemical starting points for novel drug development. We can also extend our search for repurposing candidates by looking into known gene interactions to find other more tractable targets in implicated in the same biological pathway.

  head = We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system.

  >>> Background
    There is considerable variation in disease behavior among patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19.

  >>> Methods
    We conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case–control panels.

  >>> Results
    We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P<5×10−8) in the meta-analysis of the two case–control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.15×10−10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95×10−8, respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group–specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P=1.48×10−4) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P=1.06×10−5).

  >>> Conclusions
    We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system.

    A recent genetic association study (Ellinghaus et al. 2020) identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2.

A haplotype of such length could be due to positive selection, to an unusually low recombination rate in the region, or to that the haplotype entered the human population by gene flow from Neandertals or Denisovans that occurred some 40,000 to 60,000 years ago.

While its in a smaller proportion in non-bat mammals without enrichment of selection in residues.

  >>> Abstract
    Pandemics originating from pathogen transmission between animals and humans highlight the broader need to understand how natural hosts have evolved in response to emerging human pathogens and which groups may be susceptible to infection. Here, we investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains.

  let !a self assert = Mammals, particularly bats, are diverse at ACE2 contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS62 CoV-2: In bats (N=96), we found a minimum of 64 unique amino acid sequences across the 24 amino acids and 49 across the 7 amino acids, while in other mammals (N=111), we found a minimum of 68 unique amino acid sequences across the 24 amino acids and 38 across the 7 amino acids.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !b self assert = Within species for which we were able to observe multiple individuals, we observed differing levels of diversity in the 24 sites with Bos indicus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Camelus dromedarius and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum identical within species across individuals and sites; Canis lupus showed one amino acid difference across two individuals; in contrast all four individuals of Rhinolophus sinicus were different from one another.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !c self assert = Of the 22 sites with more than one amino acid, bats were more diverse than other mammals at 13 and were more even at 15. That bats demonstrate a similar diversity in their ACE2 across these loci and greater diversity in some sites than that observed across the rest of mammals suggests they may be particularly diverse in their ACE2, and supports the idea that bats are more diverse than other suspected SARS-CoV and SARSlike CoV hosts.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !d self assert = There is some evidence that the locus is evolving in response to coronaviruses; this is similar to the finding of strong selection in aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) in response to coronaviruses in mammals. However, this pattern is driven by and strengthened in bats; in bats a greater proportion of residues that contact SARS-CoV (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.03; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02) and SARS-CoV-2 (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.02; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.0004) were under selection than other residues in the gene, whereas residues that contact SARS-CoV (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.5; Table S3) or SARS-CoV-2 (MEME p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4; MEME p<0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.5;) were not more likely to be under selection in non-bat mammals.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !e self assert = Because our dataset of bat sequences is smaller than our mammalian dataset, it further strengthens our conclusion that bats are under positive selection in contact residues. Across all mammals, positions 24 and 42 were under selection (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05), but in bats positions 27, 31, 35 and 354 (5 trees, MEME, p <0.05) and 30, 38, 329 and 393 (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.1) were additionally under positive selection while positions 45 (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05) and 353 (5 trees, MEME, p < 0.1) were under selection in non-bat mammals but not bats.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !f self assert = Both bats (pall trees < 0.002) and Rhinolophidae (pall trees < 0.00007) are under positive selection in ACE2. When we conducted an adaptive branch-site test of positive selection on all branches without specifying a foreground branch, branches in the bat clade were more likely to be selected than branches in other parts of the mammalian phylogeny (Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.05) and the branch at the base of Rhinolophidae was under positive selection.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !g self assert = When we removed the bat sequences we generated and examined the remaining terminal branches, a greater proportion of bat branches were under selection than non-bat branches, but statistical significance was lost, likely due to reduced power. Increased positive selection in bats in ACE2 compared with other mammals is consistent with their status as rich hosts of coronaviruses. Host diversity of bats in a region is associated with higher richness of coronaviruses; the diversity of bat ACE2 is consistent with the idea that a diversity of bats and their ACE2 sequences are coevolving with a diversity of viruses.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !h self assert = We found evidence that Rhinolophidae are under selection in ACE2, we found widespread selection across bats. Branches in the rhinolophid/ hipposiderid clade were not more likely to be under selection than other branches within bats (Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.7; Table S4) and bat lineages that live outside the predicted range of these viruses (e.g. in the Americas5 148 ) are also under positive selection. Therefore, there are still aspects of the bat-coronavirus relationship that we do not fully understand.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = We found some evidence for increased selection in the residues that contact this virus in bats (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.07; MEME p < 0.1, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees < 0.08), but not in non-bat mammals (MEME p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.6; MEME p < 0.1,Fisher’s exact test, pall trees > 0.4).

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !j self assert = Our finding of selection in residues that contact HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 contrasts with the findings of a smaller dataset of bats mostly from Europe, Asia and Africa and may result from our greater power to detect signal or signal originating from bats in different regions than previously tested. ACE2 regulation is known to impact survival in some influenza A infections ; New World bats are known to host many influenza A viruses, so it is possible the selection we detect could result from infection from non-coronavirus infections. Still, our results raise questions about whether there are or were SARS-related coronaviruses in these regions that have not been detected?

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !k self assert = Similarity of ACE2 yields predictions of susceptible hosts but cannot completely determine host range of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: All of the apes and most of the Old World monkeys we examined were identical to humans across all amino acid sites; those that were not identical differed by only 1 or 2 amino acids. However, amino acid similarity in these sites across different species often diverged from what we would have predicted from phylogeny alone.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !l self assert = Notably, two rodents (Mesocricetus auratus and Peromyscus leucopus) had identical or very similar amino acids to humans in all but 2 sites for each virus, and many artiodactyls (e.g. cows, deer, sheep, goats), cetaceans, cats, and pangolin were as similar or more similar to humans than New World monkeys both in residues that contact SARS-CoV and in residues that contact SARS-CoV-2. The civet fell in the middle of mammals in its similarity to humans in residues that contact either or both viruses

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !m self assert = In general, bats were not very similar to humans at these 24 amino acid sites, some with as many as five changes that would likely reduce virus binding, the most observed across mammals. Additionally, most bat sequences (56 of 91) showed that at least one of the two salt bridges (Lys31-Glu35; Asp38-Lys353 188 in humans) within ACE2 would be disrupted by changing a charged amino acid to an uncharged amino acid or to an amino acid with a clashing charge. In Rhinolophidae, only one sequence of the ten examined did not have a change in position 31 or 35 that would result in a clash between two positively charged amino acids.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !n self assert = However, bats (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001) and carnivores (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0004), particularly mustelids including ferrets, were more similar to humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV-2 than residues that contact SARS-CoV.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !o self assert = In our analysis, domestic cats were among the species most similar humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, cats can become infected and can shed both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !p self assert = Pangolins were as similar in their ACE2 residues to humans as cats, lending some support for the idea that a virus that can bind pangolin ACE2 might be able to transmit to humans.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !q self assert = Accordingly, it seems prudent to exercise precautions when interacting with species whose ACE2 is similar to humans in the contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, especially domestic animals such as cats, cows, goats and sheep. Care should also be taken with wild animals; for example, interactions between people with macaques or visitation of mountain gorillas by tourists could lead to cross-species transmission, endangering the health of humans and wildlife.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !r self assert = We predict this same glycosylated Asn is also present in some rhinolophid bats (R. ferrumequinum and some R. sinicus), though not all (R. pusillus, R. macrotis and some R. sinicus). Additionally, intraspecies variation could be an important component of reservoir competency that we are unable to assess. It is likely that not all individuals in a species are equally susceptible to infection, complicating the identification of reservoirs.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !s self assert = Spillover potential is not regulated solely by ACE2 sequence and sometimes SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 are able to replicate in hosts with divergent ACE2. Compatibility of the host protease with the virus is important for determining host range and viral strains vary in their binding properties to different species, with some SARS-like coronaviruses able to bind human, civet and rhinolophid ACE2, despite major ACE2 sequence differences between the species. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated well in ferrets, whose ACE2 ranked among the least similar to humans in their contact residues for SARS-CoV, though more similar for SARS-CoV-2. And species whose ACE2 sequence is not very similar to humans can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV.



  # pangolian as intermediate host doubt,pangolins and other trafficked animals should continue to be considered as carriers of infectious viruses
  // Single source of pangolin CoVs with a near identical Spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.184374
  ref 'Chan_et_al_07_07_2020
  head = Our analysis points out that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. and MP789 by Liu et al., were built primarily using the same metagenomic dataset published by Liu et al. in 2019. There is as yet no direct evidence of pangolins being an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, we would like to reinforce that pangolins and other trafficked animals should continue to be considered as carriers of infectious viruses with the potential to transmit into humans.

  >>> Abstract
    Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a nearly identical Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this single batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data.

  let !a self assert = The Guangdong pangolin CoV, obtained from a batch of 21 smuggled pangolins in Guangdong province in March, 2019, was originally described in October, 2019 by Liu et al. Viruses. Since then, Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, Xiao et al. Nature, Zhang et al. Current Biology, and Lam et al. Nature have each analyzed CoV sequences from this same batch of pangolins. In addition, Lam et al. describe CoVs from another batch of smuggled pangolins in Guangxi province; however, these Guangxi pangolin CoVs do not share such a high level of Spike RBD identity (only 86-87% amino acid identity) with SARS-CoV-2.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !b self assert = During this process, we were surprised to find that Xiao et al. assembled their genome GD_1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) primarily using the Liu et al. Viruses metagenomic dataset (NCBI SRA BioProject: PRJNA573298). In their paper, Xiao et al. identified the PRJNA573298 dataset as a source of contigs from pangolin viral metagenomes that mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Yet, Xiao et al. cite Liu et al. Viruses in their article as follows: “SARSr-CoV sequences were previously detected in dead Malayan pangolins (reference 15: Liu et al. Viruses). These sequences appear to be from Pangolin-CoV identified in the present study judged by their sequence similarity.” Given that Xiao et al. relied on the 2019 dataset by Liu et al. Viruses to generate their genome sequence, it is curious that it was not clear to Xiao et al. from the beginning that they were studying the same pangolin CoV.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !c self assert = Xiao et al. renamed pangolin samples first published by Liu et al. Viruses without citing their study as the original article that described these samples, and used the metagenomic data from these samples in their analysis. To compound this issue, Xiao et al. used an inconsistent definition of “total reads” in the description of the samples in their Extended Data Table 3, which made it challenging to match the samples with those from Liu et al. Viruses.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !d self assert = For samples M1 and M6, Xiao et al. counted the number of sequenced fragments in the library, which corresponds to their stated library size. For the remaining samples, Xiao et al. counted the number of sequenced reads (two reads per fragment in paired-end Illumina libraries); Supplementary Table 1 shows that the “total reads” for these samples are double the library size. We were only able to match the pangolin samples from Liu et al. Viruses with those used inXiao et al.’s analysis after becoming aware of this inconsistency. Samples lung02, lung07, lung08, and lung11 published by Liu et al. Viruses were identified as M3, M2, M4, and M8, respectively, in Xiao et al. Nature.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !e self assert = The sample lung08, first analyzed by Liu et al. Viruses, was a major source of metagenomic reads spanning the entire pangolin CoV genome. The only sample from Xiao et al., out of the samples that we could not match to those from the Liu et al. dataset, that contributed a considerable number of reads was pangolin_9 (sample M1). However, most of the pangolin_9/M1 reads map onto a single region in Orf1a.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !f self assert = When the reads from samples lung08 and pangolin_9 are combined, the resulting read coverage and alignment profile looks highly similar to the sample read profile in Xiao et al.’s; it was not specified which of their seven samples with CoV sequence reads was described by this figure. The reads from lung08 and pangolin_9 inform the large part of the metagenomic read profile when all samples are merged.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !g self assert = In addition, for the Spike RBD, the majority of the metagenomic sequence data are derived from lung08 (even so, the read depth was low). Xiao et al.’s sequences, from samples that we could not match to those from Liu et al. Viruses, do not cover the Spike receptor binding motif which encompasses residues that are critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Although Xiao et al. sequenced the full Spike gene from six PCR-positive pangolin samples, the sequence data spanning the RBD have not been made available aside from the final genome sequence of GD_1.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !h self assert = To add to the challenge of evaluating the genome sequence accuracy, at the time of this writing on May 25, 2020, we were unable to find the sequences from Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens and Xiao et al. Nature that were used to fill the numerous gaps in their genomes. This prevents independent reconstruction of these genomes.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = Briefly, each group first assembled their genome by pooling sequences across multiple pangolin samples. Xiao et al. justified this approach by explaining that there was only one ‘type’ of coronavirus among the pangolin samples. Similarly, Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens pooled sequences from three pangolins from the Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center: two of 21 pangolins confiscated in March, 2019 as described in Liu et al. Viruses, 4 and one of six pangolins confiscated in July, 2019.1 Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens commented that the July sequences were less abundant than the March sequences, and have not made these sequences available.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !j self assert = At the time of writing on May 25, 2020, we could not find a pangolin CoV genome dataset with the accession 2312773 as was provided in the Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens Data Availability statement (the article was published on May 14, 2020). We have queried NCBI databases as well as the China National GeneBank Database (https://db.cngb.org/). It is ultimately unclear which parts of the Liu et al. pangolin CoV genome MP789 drew from the July sequences. Both groups filled the gaps in their genomes using targeted PCR assays, but have not made these sequences available.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !k self assert = Sequencing errors cannot be distinguished without access to the raw sequencing data, including the gap-filling sequences. As expected, due to their reliance on the same dataset and, very likely, the same pangolin source, the Xiao et al. genome GD_1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) and the Liu et al. genome MP789 (theversion that was updated on May 18, 2020) share 99.95% nucleotide identity.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !l self assert = Based on our analysis, we emphasize that there has only been one confirmed source of pangolin CoVs with a Spike RBD nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV-2: pangolins confiscated from smugglers in Guangdong province in March, 2019.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !m self assert = The Guangdong pangolin CoV analyses by Zhang et al. and Lam et al. also used the Liu et al. Viruses 2019 dataset, and this was clearly stated in their publications. Lam et al. obtained additional March, 2019 smuggled pangolin samples from the Guangzhou Customs Technology Center (NCBI SRA BioProject: PRJNA606875), but only recovered CoV sequences from a single scale sample  and combined this with the Liu et al. Viruses dataset to generate their Guangdong pangolin CoV reference.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !n self assert = If there are batches of Guangdong pangolins other than the smuggled pangolins from March, 2019 that have resulted in similar CoV sequences, particularly at the Spike RBD, we have not been able to locate such data based on the Liu et al. and Xiao et al. publications. In comparison to the Guangdong pangolin CoV, the Guangxi pangolin CoVs described by Lam et al. are less similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the Spike RBD at both the amino acid and nucleotide level even relative to the bat CoV RaTG13 . Of the five critical residues for binding between the SARS-CoV Spike RBD and human ACE2 protein, RaTG13 and the Guangxi pangolin CoVs each share only one residue with SARS-CoV-2, whereas the Guangdong pangolin CoV shares all five residues with SARS-CoV-2.5

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !o self assert = We would like to reiterate the observations from the literature that it remains to be determined whether the Guangdong and Guangxi pangolin CoVs are found in pangolins in the wild. All of the CoV-positive pangolins were confiscated from smugglers and the Guangdong pangolins displayed severe respiratory illness and high mortality (14 of the 17 CoV-positive pangolins died within a 1.5 month interval).

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !p self assert = Xiao et al. did not detect CoVs in a second batch of pangolins (four Malayan and four Chinese pangolins) from the Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center in August, 2019.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !q self assert = During the review of our manuscript, a longitudinal study of 334 pangolins confiscated from smugglers in Malaysia, between 2009 to 2019, was published; none of the pangolins tested positive for Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, or Paramyxoviridae, and the authors similarly hypothesized that pangolins were an incidental host of coronaviruses potentially due to exposure to infected humans and other smuggled animals. It is unclear whether the CoVs were responsible for the respiratory illness observed in the Guangdong pangolins, and to what extent the post-mortem samples from pangolins that died after extensive rescue efforts can be relied upon for virus detection.

  / July, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !r self assert =  In the scenario where only smuggled pangolins possess these CoVs, the CoVs could have come from other species held in captivity given the potentially broad host tropism of the related SARS-CoV2 spike7–9 and the fact that each group of smuggled pangolins carried a single CoV strain. For instance, a Hong Kong smuggling bust in 2014 discovered 40 boxes of pangolin and masked palm civet meat (palm civets were the intermediate host of SARS-CoV, 2002-2004). In February, 2019, ~30 tons of pangolin, including 61 live pangolins, alongside bat carcasses were raided in Kota Kinabalu.  Which other species were found in the Guangdong and Guangxi anti-smuggling raids, and could these or the human smugglers be hosts of similar CoVs?

  head = We utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.

  >>> Abstract
    The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.

  let !j self assert = Evolution of ACE2: We found rare variants that would result in missense mutations in 7 out of the 25 binding residues. Some of those (e.g. E35K with an AF of 0.00001636) could reduce the virus binding affinity, thus potentially lowering the susceptibility to the virus in a very small fraction of the population. The analysis suggests that some variants (e.g. D38E) might not affect the binding while others (e.g. S19P) have uncertain effects. Further studies are needed to confirm and correctly address recent discoveries and the data presented here, investigating the possible effect of these rare variants in specific populations.

  let !k self assert = When exploring patterns of codon evolution in ACE2, we found that a number of sites are evolving at different rates in the different lineages represented in our 410-species vertebrate alignment. Multiple ACE2 RBD residues important for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 are evolving rapidly across mammals, with two (Q24 and H34) under positive selection. Relative to other lineages analyzed, Chiroptera has a greater proportion of accelerated versus conserved residues, particularly at the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, suggesting the possibility of selective forces on these codons in Chiroptera driven by their interactions with SARS-CoV-2-like viruses. Indeed, distinct signatures of positive selection found in bats and in the SARS-CoV S protein support this hypothesis that bats are evolving to tolerate SARS-CoV-2-like viruses.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !l self assert = ACE2 shows significant evidence of positive selection across mammals (⍵=1.83, LRT=194.13, p<0.001). Almost 10% of codons (N=73; 9 near the RBD) are accelerated within mammals, and 18 of these have BEB scores greater than 0.95, indicating positively selected residues. Nineteen accelerated residues, including two positively-selected codons, are critical for the binding of the ACE2 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S. Q24 has not been observed to be polymorphic within the human population, and H34 harbors a synonymous polymorphism (AF=0.00063) but no non-synonymous polymorphisms.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !m self assert = This pattern of acceleration and positive selection in ACE2 also holds for individual mammalian lineages. Using CODEML, positive selection was detected within the orders Chiroptera (LRT=346.40, ⍵=3.44 p<0.001), Cetartiodactyla (LRT=92.86, ⍵=3.83, p<0.001), Carnivora (LRT=65.66, ⍵=2.27. p<0.001), Primates (LRT=72.33, ⍵=3.16, p<0.001) and Rodentia (LRT=91.26, ⍵=1.77, p<0.001). Overall, bats had more positively selected sites with significant BEB scores (29 sites in Chiroptera compared to 10, 8, 7 and 15 sites in Cetartiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates and Rodentia, respectively).). Positive selection at key sites for the binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 was only found in the bat-specific alignment.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !n self assert = CODEML branch-site tests identified positive selection in both the ancestral Chiroptera branch (1 amino acid, ⍵=26.7, LRT= 4.22, p=0.039) and ancestral Cetartiodactyla branch (2 amino acids, ⍵=10.38, LRT= 7.89, p=0.004) using 64 mammals. These residues did not correspond to known viral binding sites. We found no evidence for lineage-specific positive selection in the ancestral primate, rodent or carnivore lineages.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !o self assert = PhyloP identified lineage-specific acceleration in Chiroptera, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla and Cetaceans relative to mammals. Bats have a particularly high level of accelerated evolution (18 codons; p<0.05). Of these accelerated residues, T27 and M82 are known to be important for binding SARS-CoV-2, with some bat subgroups having amino acids predicted to lead to less favorable binding of SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, a residue that is conserved overall in our 410 species alignment and in the mammalian subset, Q728, is perfectly conserved in all 37 species of bats except for fruit bats (Pteropodidae), which have a substitution from Q to E. These results support the theory that ACE2 is under lineage-specific selective pressures in bats relative to other mammals.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !p self assert = Positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 S protein: Positive selection was found using CODEML at sites L455, E484, F490 and S494 in the SARS-CoV-2 S sequence (⍵=1.15, LRT=116.7, p<0.001); however this signal was not particularly high, possibly due to the small sample size (N=8). All of these sites lie within or near the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S RBD binding sites.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !q self assert = Relationship of the ACE2 binding score to known infectivity of SARS-CoV-2: Data on susceptibility of wild animals to SARS-CoV-2 is still very limited. Previous study results agree with our predictions of ACE2 binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 S; 4/5 five species with demonstrated susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 score very high (Rhesus macaque) or medium (domestic cat, tiger and Golden hamster). The only inconsistency was observed for ferrets, which had a low ACE2 binding score. This inconsistency could be related to the high infectivity dose used for experimental infection that likely does not correspond to virus exposure in nature.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !r self assert = Dogs have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 under experimental conditions, and score low for binding of their ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S. However, kidney cell lines derived from dog showed ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 S entry, suggesting that in vitro experiments may be overestimating true infectivity potential. Pigs (low), ducks (very low) and chickens (very low) were similarly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and showed no susceptibility, providing further support of our methodology.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !s self assert = A recent publication reporting that SARS-CoV-2 could use pig, masked palm civet and Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ACE2 expressed in HeLa cells were inconsistent with our predictions, while data for mouse was in agreement. Indeed, while mouse ACE2 scored very low in our analysis, pig and Chinese rufous horseshoe bat score low, while the masked palm civet scored very low. As for the ferret, high-level exposure to the virus in vitro could potentially result in infection via low affinity interactions with ACE2.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !t self assert = Another possibility is that other cellular machinery present in the human HeLa cells is facilitating the infection, and that infectivity does not relate directly to ACE2 differences in these species. Confirmation of in vitro and in vivo susceptibility of these species under physiological conditions and with proper controls is clearly necessary. In addition, the expression of ACE2 varies across animal age, cell types, tissues and species, which may lead to discrepancies between SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility gleaned from experimental infections or laboratory experiments and predictions made from the ACE2-based binding score.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !u self assert = Mammals with high predicted risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Of the 19 catarrhine primates analyzed, 18/19 scored very high for binding of their ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S and one scored high (the Angola colobus); the 18 species scoring very high had 25/25 identical binding residues to human ACE2, including rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), which are known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and develop COVID-19-like clinical symptoms Our analysis predicts that all Old World primates are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 via their ACE2 receptors. Thus, many of the 21 primate species native to China could be a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining primate species were scored as high or medium, with only the Gray mouse lemur and the Philippine tarsier scoring as low.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !v self assert = We were surprised to find that all three species of Cervid deer and 12/14 cetacean species have high scores for binding of their ACE2s to SARS-CoV-2 S. There are 18 species of Cervid deer found in China. Therefore, Cervid deer cannot be ruled out as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. While coronavirus sequences have been found in white tailed deer and gammacoronaviruses have been found in beluga whales and bottlenose dolphins and are associated with respiratory diseases, the cellular receptor used by these viruses is not known.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !w self assert = Other artiodactyls: A relatively large fraction (21/30) of artiodactyl mammals were classified with medium score for ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S. These include many species that are commonly found in Hubei Province and around the world, such as domesticated cattle, sheep and goats, as well as many species commonly found in zoos and wildlife parks (e.g., Masai giraffe, okapi, hippopotamus, water buffalo, scimitar horned oryx, and Dama gazelle).

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !x self assert = Although cattle MDBK cells were shown in one study to be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, we propose immediate surveillance of common artiodactyl species for SARS-CoV-2 and studies of cellular infectivity, given our predictions. If ruminant artiodactyls can serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, it would have significant epidemiological implications as well as implications for food production and wildlife management.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !y self assert = It is noteworthy that camels and pigs, known for their ability to be infected by coronaviruses, both score low in our analysis. These data are consistent with results (discussed above) indicating that pigs cannot be infected with SARS-CoV-2 both in vivo and in vitro.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !z self assert = Rodents: Among the rodents, 7/46 species score high for ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S, with the remaining 11, 10 and 18 scoring medium, low or very low, respectively. Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus), scored very low, consistent with infectivity studies. Given that wild rodent species likely come in contact with bats as well as with other predicted high risk species, we urge surveillance of high and medium binding likelihood rodents for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !aa self assert = Bats and other species of interest: We analyzed ACE2 from 37 bat species of which 8 and 29 scored low and very low, respectively. These results were unexpected because the three Rhinolophus spp. including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat are major suspects in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, or a closely related virus, to humans. We found evidence for accelerated evolution at six RBD binding domain residues within the bat lineage, which is more than in any other lineage tested. Bats also had far more sites showing evidence of positive selection, including four binding domain residues, compared to other mammalian orders. This suggests that the diversity observed in bat ACE2 sequences may be driven by selective pressure from coronaviruses.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !ab self assert = Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to use the ACE2 receptor in bats, which challenges a recent study showing that SARS-CoV-2 can infect HeLa cells expressing Rhinolophus sinicus ACE2. If bats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus likely uses a different receptor. For example, the MERS-CoV, a betacoronavirus, uses CD26/DPP4 while the porcine transmissible enteritis virus, an alphacoronavirus uses aminopeptidase N (ANPEP). As detailed above, further in vitro and in vivo infectivity studies are required to fully understand the mode of transmission of susceptibility of bats to SARS-CoV-2.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !ac self assert = Carnivores: Our results are consistent with these studies; 9/9 felids we analyzed scored medium for ACE2 binding of SARS-CoV-2 S. However, the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), a member of the Viverridae family that is related to but distinct from Felidae, scored as very low. These results are inconsistent with transfection studies using civet ACE2 receptors expressed in HeLa cells, although these experiments have limitations as discussed above. While carnivores closely related to dogs (dingos, wolves and foxes) all scored low, experimental data supporting infection in dogs were inconsistent so no conclusions can be drawn.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !ad self assert = Pangolins: In our study, ACE2 of Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), and white bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) had low or very low binding score for SARS-CoV-2 S. Neither experimental infection nor in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for pangolins. As for ferrets and bats, if SARS-CoV-2 infects pangolins it may be using a receptor other than ACE2, based on our analysis.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !ae self assert = Other vertebrates: Our analysis of 29 orders of fishes, 29 orders of birds, 3 orders of reptiles and 2 orders of amphibians predicts that the ACE2 proteins of species within these vertebrate classes are not likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 S. Thus, vertebrate classes other than mammals are not likely to be an intermediate host or reservoir for the virus, despite predictions reported in a recent study, unless SARS-CoV-2 can use another receptor for infection. With many different non-mammal vertebrates sold in the seafood and wildlife markets of Asia and elsewhere, it is still important to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be found in non-mammalian vertebrates.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !af self assert = Relevance to Threatened Species: Among the 103 species that scored very high, high and medium for ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S RBD binding, 41 (40%) are classified in one of three ‘Threatened’ categories (Vulnerable, Endangered, and Critically Endangered) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, five are classified as Near Threatened, and two species are classified as Extinct in the Wild. This represents only a small fraction of the threatened species potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. For example, all 20 catarrhine primate species in our analysis, representing three families (Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae, and Hominidae) scored very high, suggesting that all 185 species of catarrhine primates, most of which are classified Threatened, are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !ag self assert = Similarly, all three species of deer, representatives of a family of ~92 species (Cervidae), scored as high risk, as did species representing Cetacea (baleen and toothed whales), and both groups contain a number of threatened species. Toothed whales have potential for viral outbreaks and have lost function of a gene key to the antiviral response in other mammalian lineages. If they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 , human-to-animal transmission could pose a risk through sewage outfall and contaminated refuse from cities, commercial vessels and cruise liners. In contrast, some threatened species scored low or very low, such as the giant panda (low), potentially positive news for these at risk populations.

  let !ah self assert = Animal models for COVID-19: Our results provide an extended list of potential species that might be useful as animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis, including Chinese hamster and Syrian/Golden hamster, and large animals maintained for biomedical and agricultural research (e.g., domesticated sheep and cattle).

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !ai self assert = While species ranked high or medium may be susceptible to infection based on the features of their ACE2 residues, pathological outcomes may be very different among species depending on other mechanisms that could affect virus replication and spread to target cells, tissues, and organs within the host. Nonetheless, our predictions provide a useful starting point for selection of appropriate animal models for COVID-19 research and for identification of species that may be at risk for human-to-animal or animal-to-animal transmissions by SARS-CoV-2. The approach we used for ACE2 can be extended to other cellular proteins known to be involved in coronavirus infection and immunity to better understand infection, transmission, inflammatory responses and disease progression.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !aj self assert = Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that infection in any species occurs via another cellular receptor, as has been shown for other betacoronaviruses. Until such time, other than for species in which SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated to occur using ACE2, we urge caution not to over-interpret the predictions made in the present study. This is especially important with regards to species, endangered or otherwise, in human care.

  head = Our 5-year longitudinal study demonstrates that all building blocks of the pandemic SARS-CoV genome are present in bat SARSr-CoVs from a single location in Yunnan. Frequent recombination events have happened among those SARSr-CoVs in the same cave. There is sufficient evidence that SARS-CoV most likely originated from horseshoe bats via recombination events among existing SARSr-CoVs. Various SARSr-CoVs capable of using human ACE2 are still circulating among bats in this region.

  >>> Abstract
    A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China. However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.

  let !b self assert = These findings provide strong genetic evidence for the bat origin of SARS-CoV with regard to the S gene or ORF8. However, all of these SARSr-CoVs were distinct from SARS-CoV in at least one other gene, suggesting that none of them was the immediate progenitor of SARS-CoV. Moreover, these SARSr-CoVs were discovered in bat populations from physically distinct locations. The site of origin of the true progenitor of SARS-CoV and the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV have until now remained elusive.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !f self assert = We have identified a bat habitat potentially important for SARSr-CoV evolution where a series of recombination events have likely occurred among different SARSr-CoV strains, which provides new insights into the origin of SARS-CoV.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !g self assert = SARSr-CoVs discovered in bats from neighboring areas of Guangdong to date have shown phylogenetic disparity from SARS-CoV especially in the S gene, suggesting SARS-CoV may have originated from another region. Our analysis of the phylogeny of SARS-CoVs and all known bat SARSr-CoVs using the nt sequence of their non-structural ORF1a and ORF1b genes, which constitute the majority of the genome, shows that SARSr-CoV evolution is strongly correlated with their geographical origin, but not host species.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !c self assert = It is noteworthy that SARSr-CoVs detected in Yunnan are more closely related to SARS-CoV than strains from other regions in China. This finding implies that Yunnan, or southwestern China, is more likely to be the geographical source of SARS-CoV than other regions in China, but data from more extensive surveillance are yet needed to support this inference.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !h self assert = In our longitudinal surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a single cave in Yunnan where we discovered Rs3367, RsSHC014, WIV1 and WIV16, the CoV prevalence in fecal samples varied among different sampling time. Generally, a higher prevalence was observed in autumn (September and October) than in spring and early summer (April and May). This may be due to the establishment of a susceptible subpopulation of newborn bats which had not developed their own immunity after the parturition period

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !i self assert = Another factor may be the changes in the composition of bat species in the cave at different sampling dates. For example, in September 2012 when the CoV prevalence reached 51.3%, the majority of samples were from R. sinicus, but in May 2015 when only 3 out of the 145 samples tested positive, Aselliscus stoliczkanus was the predominant bat species in the cave

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !j self assert = We failed to amplify the RBD sequences from 15 of the 64 SARSr-CoV positive samples. Most of these samples had comparatively low viral concentration (< 107 copies/g), as revealed by our previous quantitative studies. The unsuccessful amplification of RBD in some samples with high viral concentration was probably because of the more divergent sequences in this region of these SARSr-CoV genomes.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !d self assert = In this cave, we have now obtained full-length genome sequences of additional 11 novel SARSr-CoVs from bats. Our findings suggest the co-circulation of different bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to SARS-CoV in the most variable S1 (NTD and RBD), ORF8 and ORF3 regions, respectively, in this single location. In the ORF1a, ORF1b, E, M and N genes, the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this cave also shared > 98% aa sequence identities with human/civet SARS-CoVs.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !e self assert = Furthermore, strains closely related to different representative bat SARSr-CoVs from other provinces (e.g. Rs672, HKU3 and Rf1) in the RBD region were also detected there. Therefore, this cave could be regarded as a rich gene pool of bat SARSr-CoVs, wherein concurrent circulation of a high diversity of SARSr-CoV strains has led to an unusually diverse assemblage of SARSr-CoVs.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !f self assert = More recently, we discovered WIV16 which had an RBD almost identical to WIV1’s but shared much higher similarity with SARS-CoV than WIV1 in the NTD region of S1, making it the closest SARSr-CoV to the epidemic strains identified to date.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !g self assert = In this study, we found a novel strain Rs4231 from the same location sharing almost identical NTD sequence with WIV16 but distinct from it in the RBD, with evidence of a recombination event. Our recombination analysis indicated that a recombination event may have taken place at the junction between the coding region of NTD and RBD in the Rs4231 and WIV1 genomes and resulted in WIV16.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !h self assert = Recombination at this genomic position also happened among other SARSr-CoVs relatively distant to SARS-CoV found in this location (e.g. Rs4081 and Rs4247, S5). The frequent recombination at this hotspot in the S gene increased the genetic diversity of SARSr-CoVs harbored in these bat populations and might have been responsible for the generation of the S gene of the direct progenitor strain of SARS-CoV.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !i self assert = The genomes of SARS-CoVs from patients during the early epidemic phase and civet SARS-CoVs all contained a single full-length ORF8. We have found that a number of bat SARSr-CoVs from this cave possessed a complete ORF8 highly similar to that of early human/civet SARS-CoV (>97% nt sequence identity), represented by strain Rf4092. This provided further evidence for the source of human SARS-CoV ORF8 in bats.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !p self assert = In this study, we have discovered for the first time a bat SARSr-CoV with ORF8a and ORF8b highly similar to the later-phase human SARS-CoVs, though the split of ORF8 in the bat SARSr-CoV and that in human SARS-CoV were two independent events.

  / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !j self assert = Our recombination analysis suggests that this strain, Rs4084, likely acquired its ORF8 from Rf4092 through recombination, followed by the development of the 5-nt deletion which led to the splitting. It suggests that ORF8 region in bat SARSr-CoV genomes is prone to deletions as in human SARS-CoV.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !r self assert =  Finally, the recombination analysis suggests that an ancestral strain of SARS-CoV SZ3 would have been generated if the recombination around ORF8 had occurred between the lineages that led to WIV16 and Rf4092.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !s self assert = Taken together, the evidence of recombination events among SARSr-CoVs harbored by bats in this single location suggests that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated as a result of a series of recombination within the S gene and around ORF8. This could have been followed by the spillover from bats to civets and people either in the region, or during movement of infected animals through the wildlife trade. However, given the paucity of data on animal trade prior to the SARS outbreak, the likely high geographical sampling bias in bat surveillance for SARSr-CoVs in southern China, and the possibility that other caves harbor similar bat species assemblages and a rich diversity of SARSr-CoVs, a definite conclusion about the geographical origin of SARS-CoV cannot be drawn at this point.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !t self assert = R. sinicus are regarded as the primary natural host of SARS-CoV, as all SARSr-CoVs highly homologous to SARS-CoV in the S gene were predominantly found in this species. However, it is noted that two SARSr-CoVs previously reported from R. ferrumequinum showed the closest phylogenetic position to SARS-CoV in the ORF1a/1b trees. These strains were discovered in another location in Yunnan 80 km from the cave surveyed in the current study

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !u self assert = This information also supports the speculation that SARS-CoV may have originated from this region. Nonetheless, since the correlation between the host species and the phylogeny of SARSr-CoV ORF1ab seems limited, more SARSr-CoV sequences need to be obtained from different Rhinolophus bat species in both locations in Yunnan, and from other locations in southern China. In particular, it will be important to assess whether R. ferrumequinum played a more important role in the evolution of SARS-CoV ORF1ab.

  # let !v self assert = In this study, we confirmed the use of human ACE2 as receptor of two novel SARSr-CoVs by using chimeric viruses with the WIV1 backbone replaced with the S gene of the newly identified SARSr-CoVs. Rs7327’s S protein varied from that of WIV1 and WIV16 at three aa residues in the receptor-binding motif, including one contact residue (aa 484) with human ACE2. This difference did not seem to affect its entry and replication efficiency in human ACE2-expressing cells.

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !w self assert = These results indicate that diverse variants of SARSr-CoV S protein without deletions in their RBD are able to use human ACE2. In contrast, our previous study revealed that the S protein of a R. sinicus SARSr-CoV with deletions (Rp3) failed to use human, civet and bat ACE2 for cell entry.

These 7 strains, plus Rs4874 and the previously studied WIV1 and RsSHC014, could represent all types of S variants of SARSr-CoVs in this location. However, none of the strains with deletions in the RBD could be rescued from Vero E6 cells. Therefore, the two distinct clades of SARSr-CoV S gene may represent the usage of different receptors in their bat hosts.

  # let !y self assert = The results indicate that the variants of bat SARSr-CoV ORF8 proteins may play a role in modulating ER stress by activating the ATF6 pathway. In addition, the ORF8a protein of SARS-CoV from the later phase has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis. In this study, we have found that the ORF8a protein of the newly identified SARSr-CoV Rs4084, which contained an 8-aa insertion compared with the SARS-CoV ORF8a, significantly triggered apoptosis in 293T cells as well.

  # let !z self assert = Compared with the 154-aa ORF3b of SARS-CoV, the ORF3b proteins of all previously identified bat SARSr-CoVs were smaller in size due to the early translation termination. However, for the first time, we discovered an ORF3b without the C-terminal truncation in a bat SARSr-CoV, Rs7327, which differed from the ORF 3b of SARS-CoV GZ02 strain at only one aa residue.The SARS-CoV ORF3b antagonizes interferon function by modulating the activity of IFN regulatory factor 3

  # / November, 2017 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !aa self assert = Our previous studies also demonstrated that the ORF3b protein of a bat SARSr-CoV, termed Rm1, which was C-terminally truncated to 56 aa and shared 62% aa sequence identity with SARS-CoV, still displayed the IFN antagonist activity. It is very interesting to investigate in further studies whether Rs7327’s ORF3b and other versions of truncated ORF3b such as WIV1 and WIV16 also show IFN antagonism profiles.

This is particularly important given that the nearest village to the bat cave we surveyed is only 1.1 km away, which indicates a potential risk of exposure to bats for the local residents.

  let !a self assert = From current data it is clear that the CFR for COVID-19 is substantially higher than that of seasonal influenza but lower than that of two closely related coronaviruses that have similarly recently emerged in humans. it is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and that individuals can transmit the virus when asymptomatic or presymptomatic, although how frequently remains uncertain.

  # let !b self assert = Given that SARS-CoV-2 undoubtedly has a zoonotic origin, the link to such a “wet” market should come as no surprise. However, as not all of the early cases were market associated, it is possible that the emergence story is more complicated than first suspected.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !c self assert = Genome sequences of “environmental samples”—likely surfaces—from the market have now been obtained, and phylogenetic analysis reveals that they are very closely related to viruses sampled from the earliest Wuhan patients. While this again suggests that the market played an important role in virus emergence, it is not clear whether the samples were derived from people who inadvertently deposited infectious material or from animals or animal matter present at that location. Unfortunately, the apparent lack of direct animal sampling in the market may mean that it will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to accurately identify any animal reservoir at this location.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !d self assert = We focused on a patient admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on December 26, 2019, six days after the onset of symptoms. Fortunately, next-generation meta-transcriptomic sequencing enabled us to obtain a complete viral genome from this patient on January 5, 2020. Initial analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to those of SARS-like viruses (family Coronaviridae). Although the GenBank sequence (GenBank: MN908947) was the first of SARS-CoV-2 available, it was subsequently corrected to ensure its accuracy. With the help of Dr. Andrew Rambaut (University of Edinburgh), we released the genome sequence of the virus on the open access Virological website early on January 11, 2020.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !e self assert = Initial comparisons revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 79% similar to SARS-CoV at the nucleotide level. Of course, patterns of similarity vary greatly between genes, and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit only ∼72% nucleotide sequence similarity in the spike (S) protein, the key surface glycoprotein that interacts with host cell receptors.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !f self assert = Given these close evolutionary relationships, it is unsurprising that the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles those of other betacoronaviruses, with the gene order 5′-replicase ORF1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3′. The long replicase ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 is over 21 kb in length and contains 16 predicted non-structural proteins and a number of downstream open reading frames (ORFs) likely of similar function to those of SARS-CoV.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !g self assert = This virus, denoted RaTG13, is ∼96% similar to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide sequence level. Despite this sequence similarity, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ in a number of key genomic features, arguably the most important of which is that SARS-CoV-2 contains a polybasic (furin) cleavage site insertion (residues PRRA) at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits of the S protein. This insertion, which may increase the infectivity of the virus, is not present in related betacoronaviruses, although similar polybasic insertions are present in other human coronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1, as well as in highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !h self assert = In addition, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are only ∼85% similar and share just one of six critical amino acid residues. Both sequence and structural comparisons suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is well suited for binding to the human ACE2 receptor that was also utilized by SARS-CoV.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !i self assert = An independent insertion(s) of the amino acids PAA at the S1/S2 cleavage site was recently observed in a virus (RmYN02) sampled in mid-2019 from another Rhinolophus bat in Yunnan province, indicating that these insertion events reflect a natural part of ongoing coronavirus evolution. While RmYN02 is relatively divergent from SARS-CoV-2 in the S protein (∼72% sequence similarity), it is the closest relative (∼97% nucleotide sequence similarity) of the human virus in the long replicase gene.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !j self assert = Although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and have bat reservoirs, the biological differences between these viruses are striking. As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is markedly more infectious, resulting in very different epidemiological dynamics to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !k self assert = The exact role played by bats in the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not established. In particular, the bat viruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were sampled from animals in Yunnan province, over 1,500 km from Wuhan. There are relatively few bat coronaviruses from Hubei province, and those that have been sequenced are relatively distant to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees. The simple inference from this is that our sampling of bat viruses is strongly biased toward some geographical locations.

  # / March, 2020 - Cell
  # let !l self assert = In addition, although sequence similarity values of 96%–97% make it sound like the available bat viruses are very closely related to SARS-CoV-2, in reality this likely represents more than 20 years of sequence evolution (although the underlying molecular clock may tick at an uncertain rate if there was strong adaptive evolution of the virus in humans). It is therefore almost a certainty that more sampling will identify additional bat viruses that are even closer relatives of SARS-CoV-2.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !m self assert = To determine what these intermediate host species might be, it is imperative to perform a far wider sampling of animals from wet markets or that live close to human populations. This is highlighted by the recent discovery of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into southern China (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces).The Guangdong pangolin viruses are particularly closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, containing all six of the six key mutations thought to shape binding to the ACE2 receptor and exhibiting 97% amino acid sequence similarity (although they are more divergent from SARS-CoV-2 in the remainder of the genome).

  # / March, 2020 - Cell
  # let !n self assert = Although pangolins are of great interest because of how frequently they are involved in illegal trafficking and their endangered status, that they carry a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 strongly suggests that a far greater diversity of related betacoronaviruses exists in a variety of mammalian species but has yet to be sampled.

  # / March, 2020 - Cell
  # let !o self assert = It cannot be excluded that the virus acquired some of its key mutations during a period of “cryptic” spread in humans prior to its first detection in December 2019. Specifically, it is possible that the virus emerged earlier in human populations than envisaged (perhaps not even in Wuhan) but was not detected because asymptomatic infections, those with mild respiratory symptoms, and even sporadic cases of pneumonia were not visible to the standard systems used for surveillance and pathogen identification. During this period of cryptic transmission, the virus could have gradually acquired the key mutations, perhaps including the RBD and furin cleavage site insertions, that enabled it to adapt fully to humans.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !p self assert = Recombination is visible at multiple locations across the sarbevirus genome, including in the S protein, and in bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. For example, there is some evidence for recombination among SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and the Guangdong pangolin CoVs, and the genome of RmYN02 has similarly been widely impacted by recombination. However, trying to determine the exact pattern and genomic ancestry of recombination events is difficult, particularly as many of the recombinant regions may be small and are likely to change as we sample more viruses related to SARS-CoV-2.

  # / March, 2020 - Cell
  # let !q self assert = Ongoing Genomic Evolution of SARS-CoV-2: Given the high mutation rates that characterize RNA viruses, it is obvious that many more mutations will appear in the viral genome and that these will help us to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the epidemic grows, our sample size of sequences will likely be so small relative to the total number of cases that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to detect individual transmission chains. Caution must therefore always be exercised when attempting to infer exact transmission events.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !r self assert = As an aside, although coronaviruses likely have lower mutation rates than other RNA viruses because of an inherent capacity for some proof-reading activity due to a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease, their long-term rates of nucleotide substitution (i.e., of molecular evolution) fall within the distribution of those seen in other RNA viruses.

  / March, 2020 - Cell
  let !s self assert = This suggests that lower mutation rates are to some extent compensated by high rates of virus replication within hosts. Although there is no evidence that this capacity to mutate (common to RNA viruses) will result in any radical changes in phenotype—such as in transmissibility and virulence—as these only rarely change at the scale of individual disease outbreaks, it is obviously important to monitor any changes in phenotype as the virus spreads. In all likelihood, any drop in the number of cases and/or CFR of COVID-19 will likely be due to rising immunity in the human population and epidemiological context rather than mutational changes in the virus.

  >>> Abstract
    The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined. The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear. These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine viral genomic data, with epidemiological studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 shared very low similarity with those sequences in SARS-CoV and BM48-31, and ORF10 had a premature stop codon in both SARS-CoV and BM48-31. A one-base deletion caused a frame-shift mutation in ORF10 of ZXC21.

  / March, 2020 - National Science Review
  let !c self assert = Notably, we found that the nucleotide divergence at synonymous sites between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was much higher than previously anticipated. For example, although the overall genomic nucleotides differ ∼4% between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the genomic average dS was 0.17, which means the divergence at the neutral sites is 17% between these two viruses.

  / March, 2020 - National Science Review
  let !d self assert = We found that the dS value varied considerably across genes in SARS-CoV-2 and the other viruses analyzed. In particular, the spike gene (S) consistently exhibited larger dS values than other genes. This extremely elevated dS value of spike could be caused either by a high mutation rate or by natural selection that favors synonymous substitutions.

  # / March, 2020 - National Science Review
  # let !e self assert = Our codon usage bias analysis suggests the FOP of spike was only slightly higher than that of the genomic average (0.717 versus 0.698). Thus, we believe that the elevated synonymous substitution rate measured in spike is more likely caused by higher mutational rates; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.

In other words, 87.6% to 95.6% of the nonsynonymous mutations were removed by negative selection during viral evolution.

  # / March, 2020 - National Science Review
  # let !h self assert = A Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis suggested that 10 AA sites showed strong signals of positive selection, and, interestingly, three of these were located in the RBD of spike, including at one critical site. Thus, although these coronaviruses were generally under very strong negative selection, positive selection was also responsible for the evolution of protein sequences.

  # let !i self assert = In total, we identified mutations in 149 sites across the 103 sequenced strains. Ancestral states for 43 synonymous, 83 non-synonymous, and two stop-gain mutations were unambiguously inferred. Most derived mutations were singletons (65.1% (28/43) of synonymous mutations and 84.3% (70/83) of nonsynonymous mutations), indicating either a recent origin or population growth.

  # / March, 2020 - National Science Review
  # let !j self assert = In general, the derived alleles of synonymous mutations were significantly skewed towards higher frequencies than those of nonsynonymous ones (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) suggesting the nonsynonymous mutations tended to be selected against. However, 16.3% (7 out of 43) synonymous mutations, and one nonsynonymous (ORF8 (L84S, 28,144)) mutation had a derived frequency of ≥ 70% across the SARS-CoV-2 strains. The nonsynonymous mutations that had derived alleles in at least two SARS-CoV-2 strains affected six proteins: orf1ab (A117T, I1607V, L3606F, I6075T), S (H49Y, V367F), ORF3a (G251V), ORF7a (P34S), ORF8 (V62L, S84L), and N (S194L, S202N, P344S).

  let !m self assert = Furthermore, our mutational load analysis indicated that the L lineage had accumulated a significantly higher number of derived mutations than S lineage (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). These results support notions that two lineages of SARS-CoV-2 viruses may have experienced different selective pressures.

Although novel mutations could lead to this result, the most parsimonious explanation is that this patient may have been infected by both the L and S lineages.

  # let !o self assert = We found 17 genomic sites that showed evidence of heteroplasmy of SARS-CoV-2 virus in five patients, but we did not find any other instances of the co-existence of L and S lineages in any patient. These findings point to the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Further studies investigating how the different alleles of SARS-CoV-2 viruses compete with one and another will be of significant value.

Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaption to the novel human host.

  >>> Abstract
    The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which jumped into the human population in late 2019 from a currently uncharacterised reservoir. Due to this extremely recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its human host. This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 to date are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we developed a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of over 23,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaption to the novel human host. We find no evidence at this stage for the emergence of more transmissible lineages of SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent mutations.

  # let !a self assert = No assemblies were found to deviate by more than 29 SNPs from the reference genome, Wuhan-Hu-1, which is consistent with the relatively recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 towards the latter portion of 2019. We informally estimate the mutation rate over our alignment to 9.6 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year, which is consistent with previous rates estimated for SARS-CoV-2. This rate also falls in line with those observed in other coronaviruses, and is fairly unremarkable relative to other positive single-stranded RNA viruses, which do not have a viral proof-reading mechanism.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !b self assert = Genetic diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 population remains moderate with an average pairwise SNP difference across isolates of 9.71 (3-19, 95% CI). This low number of mutations between any two viruses currently in circulation means that, to date, SARS-CoV-2 can be considered as a single essentially clonal lineage, notwithstanding taxonomic efforts to categorise extant diversity into sublineages.

  let !c self assert = Our dataset includes viruses sequenced from 86 countries, with a good temporal coverage. While some countries are far more densely sampled than others, the emerging picture is that fairly limited geographic structure is observed in the viruses in circulation in any one region. All major clades in the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 are represented in various regions of the world, and the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation in different continents is fairly uniform.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !d self assert = Distribution of recurrent mutations: As identified by previous studies, we recover evidence of strong mutational biases across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. A remarkably high proportion of CàU changes was observed relative to other types of SNPs and this pattern was observed at both non-homoplasic and homoplasic sites. Additionally, mutations involving cytosines were almost exclusively CàU mutations (98%) and the distributions of k-mers for homoplasic sites appeared markedly different compared to that across all variable positions. In particular, we observe an enrichment in CCA and TCT 3-mers containing a variable base in their central position, which are known APOBEC targets.

  let !e self assert = Across our dataset we identified a total of 8,667 mutations, heavily enriched in CàU transitions, of which we identified 308 strongly supported recurrent mutations. We found no mutation was convincingly associated with a significant increase or decrease in transmissibility.

  # let !f self assert = The vast majority of mutations segregating at reasonable frequency are essentially neutral in the context of transmission and viral fitness. Instead the entire set of 80 recurrent mutations seem to fit an expectation for neutral evolution with respect to transmissibility, with a mean and median overall Log10RoHO score of -0.002 and and -0.06.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !i self assert = The D614G mutation displays only three independent emergences that qualify for inclusion in our analyses. The low number of recurrent mutations leading to the D614G allele suggests that, rather than being a driver a of transmission itself, it arose early and went up in frequency by hitchhiking with one of the deepest branches in the global phylogeny as the SARS-CoV-2 population expanded. In this context, it is of note that D614G is in linkage disequilibrium with two other derived mutations (nucleotide positions 3037 and 11,408) that have experienced highly similar expansions.

  # let !j self assert = All three mutations are found in around 72% of the genomes in our global SARS-CoV-2 alignment, and rarely occuring isolation with 99% (16,538/16,677) of genomes with the D614G mutation also carrying the derived alleles at the two other sites. Consistent with our findings that D614G is unlikely to be a large driver of viral transmission, our results support a wider narrative where the vast majority of mutations segregating at reasonably high frequency in SARS-CoV-2 are essentially neutral with respect to viral fitness.

  head = By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions.

  >>> Summary
    The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence of widespread sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.

  # let !a self assert = Our phylogenetic analyses showed that the outbreak in Connecticut was caused by multiple virus introductions and that most of these viruses were related to those sequenced from other states rather than international locations.

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !b self assert = Our first nine SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered into three distinct phylogenetic clades, indicating multiple independent virus introductions into Connecticut. Our SARS-CoV-2 genome CT-Yale-001 clusters closely with other viruses sequenced from Asia (China), whereas the close genetic relatedness of genomes from Europe and Washington state in the clade that contains CT-Yale-006 makes it difficult to track the origins of this virus. Regardless, neither the CT-Yale-001 nor the CT-Yale-006 COVID-19 cases were travel-associated, which indicates that these patients were part of domestic transmission chains that stemmed from undetected introductions.

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !c self assert = Because of a paucity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other regions within the United States, we could not determine the exact domestic origin of these viruses in Connecticut. We also cannot yet determine whether the higher number of substitutions observed in CT-Yale-007 and CT-Yale-008 compared with the other Connecticut virus genomes within this clade was the result of multiple introductions or of significant undersampling.

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !d self assert = However, given that seven of our nine Connecticut SARS-CoV-2 genomes fell within this clade versus the many other international clades, these were most likely the result of a common domestic source(s) rather than repeated international introductions. Importantly, our data indicate that, by early to mid-March, there had already been interstate spread during the early COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !e self assert = We found that, because of the large volume of daily domestic air passengers, the dominant importation risk into the Connecticut region switched from international to domestic by early to mid-March.

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !h self assert = We found that the domestic and international SARS-CoV-2 importation risk started to increase dramatically at the beginning of March 2020. Without accounting for the effects of international travel restrictions, our estimated domestic importation risk from the selected five states surpassed the international importation risk by March 10.

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !i self assert = Because of the overall low prevalence of COVID-19 in China, we did not find any significant effects of travel restrictions from China that were enacted on February 1 (Data S3). Also, we did not find significant changes to the importation risk following travel restrictions from Iran on March 1, likely because of the relatively small number of passengers arriving from that country (Data S3). Although we did find a dramatic decrease in international importation risk following the restrictions on travel from Europe (March 13), this decrease occurred after our estimates of domestic travel importation risk had already surpassed that of international importation

  # / May, 2020 - Cell
  # let !j self assert = Although such variations may lower our domestic risk estimates, we also did not account for the large volumes of regional automobile and rail travel, especially along the corridor that connects Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. to Connecticut. We do not believe that Connecticut is more closely connected to its neighbors than states in other regions of the country. Therefore, our risk estimates indicate that this interconnectedness will perpetuate the domestic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that domestic spread will likely become the primary source of new infections in the United States.

  >>> Abstract
    Spatiotemporal bias in genome sequence sampling can severely confound phylogeographic inference based on discrete trait ancestral reconstruction. This has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a global scale, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history. When confronted with these issues, incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2, while also including global air transportation data. We demonstrate that including travel history data for each SARS-CoV-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread, particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts. Although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them, they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference.

  # let !a self assert = Regardless of what location data we use in the analyses, they consistently indicate that in this early stage, SARS-CoV-2 spread is shaped by air travel and not by geographic distance, and that there is strong asymmetric flow out of Hubei. Interestingly, this asymmetry is somewhat stronger for the analyses that incorporate travel locations compared to the analysis using only sampling locations. One explanation is that the majority of travellers were returning from Hubei, and adding this information contributes appropriately to the intensity of outflux from Hubei.

  let !b self assert = We consider a case study involving the spatial path of a virus that was collected in Switzerland in February 2020 (EPI_ISL_413021). The Swiss virus is part of lineage B.1 and is positioned within a cluster of viruses primarily from Europe. The Swiss virus was imported from Italy, and not the Netherlands. The fact that this cluster contains five genomes from travellers returning from Italy to various countries, including Germany, Scotland, Mexico, Nigeria, and Brazil, is instrumental in positioning Italy at the root of this cluster and helps correct for Italy’s lack of data.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !c self assert = Although the trajectory suggests an introduction into Italy from Germany, the support for this is not overwhelming and solely due to the single genome sample from Germany basal to the Italian cluster. We include another trajectory for a virus in this cluster from a Brazilian traveller (EPI_ISL_412964) returning from Italy that confirms the pattern inferred for the Swiss sample.

The virus is positioned within a clade of other closely related viruses from Australia (lineage B.4), some of which were sampled from travellers returning from Iran. The travel-aware reconstruction clearly supports Iranian ancestry.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !e self assert = We add unsampled taxa for locations that are undersampled according to case counts (cfr. Methods), primarily for Hubei (n = 307), Italy (n = 47), Iran (n = 40), and South Korea (n = 30). In contrast to the reconstructions with no unsampled taxa, we now mainly observe a direct transition from Hubei to Italy (posterior probability = 0.88), implying that a second introduction from Hubei that is independent from the introduction into Germany may have seeded the Italian clade. This hypothesis arises from the inclusion of unsampled Hubei taxa that now cluster between the German virus and the Italian clade, even though the branch connecting the German genome to the Italian clade only represents a single substitution. The many unsampled Italian taxa that fall in this clade further reinforce its Italian ancestry.

  / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !f self assert = The inclusion of unsampled taxa also provides more resolution on the Hubei ancestry of the Iran-Australia case study in lineage B.4 (EPI_ISL_412975). Notably, this virus was sampled before the first report of COVID-19 in Iran on February 19th, but our reconstruction indicates that considerable diversification, and hence transmission, already took place prior to this report.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !g self assert = In addition to focusing on specific transmission patterns, we also summarize the overall dispersal dynamics in a way that marginalizes over plausible phylogenetic histories for the four different analyses we perform. While introductions from Hubei represent the dominant pattern when using sampling location only, this is far more pronounced for the other analyses. Using sampling location suggests unrealistic dispersal from locations such as Australia and The Netherlands that largely disappear in the other analyses, specifically when using travel history data without or with unsampled diversity.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv

  head = The ability of SADS-CoV to replicate in various cells lines from a broad range of species and the unexpected tropism for murine DCs provide important insights into the biology of this bat-origin CoV, highlighting its possible ability to cross interspecies barriers and the potential role of rodents as susceptible hosts in the field.

  >>> Abstract
    Outbreaks of severe diarrhea in neonatal piglets in Guangdong, China, in 2017 resulted in the isolation and discovery of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) derived from the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (Y. Pan, X. Tian, P. Qin, B. Wang, et al., Vet Microbiol 211:15–21, 2017). SeACoV was later referred to as swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) by another group (P. Zhou, H. Fan, T. Lan, X.-L. Yang, et al., Nature 556:255–258, 2018). The present study was set up to investigate the potential species barriers of SADS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that SADS-CoV possesses a broad species tropism and is able to infect cell lines from diverse species, including bats, mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, pigs, chickens, nonhuman primates, and humans. Trypsin contributes to but is not essential for SADS-CoV propagation in vitro. Furthermore, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with the virus via oral or intraperitoneal routes. Although the mice exhibited only subclinical infection, they supported viral replication and prolonged infection in the spleen. SADS-CoV nonstructural proteins and double-stranded RNA were detected in splenocytes of the marginal zone on the edge of lymphatic follicles, indicating active replication of SADS-CoV in the mouse model. We identified that splenic dendritic cells (DCs) are the major targets of virus infection by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry approaches. Finally, we demonstrated that SADS-CoV does not utilize known CoV receptors for cellular entry. The ability of SADS-CoV to replicate in various cells lines from a broad range of species and the unexpected tropism for murine DCs provide important insights into the biology of this bat-origin CoV, highlighting its possible ability to cross interspecies barriers.

  head = The primary pathways of transmission from bats to people in Bangladesh are through contamination of raw date palm sap by bats with subsequent consumption by humans and through infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats), presumably from consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine with subsequent transmission to people. Approximately one-half of recognized Nipah case patients in Bangladesh developed their disease following person-to-person transmission of the virus.

  >>> Abstract
    Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus whose reservoir host is fruit bats of the genus Pteropus . Occasionally the virus is introduced into human populations and causes severe illness characterized by encephalitis or respiratory disease. The first outbreak of NiV was recognized in Malaysia, but 8 outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001. The primary pathways of transmission from bats to people in Bangladesh are through contamination of raw date palm sap by bats with subsequent consumption by humans and through infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats), presumably from consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine with subsequent transmission to people. Approximately one-half of recognized Nipah case patients in Bangladesh developed their disease following person-to-person transmission of the virus. Efforts to prevent transmission should focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and reducing family members' and friends' exposure to infected patients' saliva.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !a self assert = Epidemiological investigations in Bangladesh have identified three pathways of transmission of NiV from bats to people. The most frequently implicated route is ingestion of fresh date palm sap. Date palm sap is harvested from December through March, particularly in west central Bangladesh. A tap is cut into the tree trunk and sap flows slowly overnight into an open clay pot. Infrared camera studies confirm that P. giganteus bats frequently visit date palm sap trees and lick the sap during collection. NiV can survive for days on sugar-rich solutions such as fruit pulp.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !b self assert = In the 2005 Nipah outbreak in Tangail District, Bangladesh, the only exposure significantly associated with illness was drinking raw date palm sap (64% of case patients vs 18% of control patients; odds ratio [OR], 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–38; P=.01). Twenty-one of the 23 index NiV case patients recognized in Bangladesh developed their initial symptoms during the December through March date palm sap collection season.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !c self assert = A second route of transmission for NiV from bats to people in Bangladesh is via domestic animals. Fruit bats commonly drop partially eaten saliva-laden fruit. Domestic animals in Bangladesh forage for such food. Date palm sap that is contaminated with bat feces and so is unfit for human consumption is also occasionally fed to domestic animals. The domestic animals may become infected with NiV, and shed the virus to other animals, including humans.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !d self assert = Contact with a sick cow in Meherpur, Bangladesh in 2001 was strongly associated with Nipah infection (OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.2–27.7; P=.001). A pig herd visited the community two weeks before the 2003 Nipah outbreak in Naogaon and contact with the pigs was associated with illness (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.3–27.8; P=.007). In 2004, one family explained that they owned 2 goats that their son frequently played with. The goats became ill with fever, difficulty walking, walking in circles, and frothing at the mouth. The parents believe their son had contact with goat saliva while the goats were ill. Both goats died. Within 2 weeks of the goats' death, the child developed encephalitis that was confirmed to be Nipah by antibody testing. Third, some people may come into direct contact with NiV-infected bat secretions. In the Goalando outbreak in 2004, persons who climbed trees were more likely to develop NiV infection than were control patients (OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.3-∞).

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !e self assert = In a review of the 122 Nipah case patients identified in Bangladesh from 2001 through 2007, 62 (51%) developed illness after close contact with another Nipah patient.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !f self assert = Respiratory secretions appear to be particularly important for person-to-person transmission of NiV. NiV RNA is readily identified in the saliva of infected patients. Anthropological investigations during the Faridpur outbreak highlighted multiple opportunities for the transfer of NiV contaminated saliva from a sick patient to care providers. In both the Faridpur outbreak in 2004 and the Thakurgaon outbreak in 2007, persons who were in a room when a Nipah patient was coughing or sneezing were at increased risk of Nipah virus infection. Across all recognized outbreaks in Bangladesh from 2001 through 2007, Nipah patients with respiratory symptoms were more likely to transmit Nipah.

  / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  let !g self assert = However, the pattern of the outbreaks in Bangladesh and India suggests that person-to-person transmission is more dependent on the characteristics of the occasional Nipah transmitter than a specific strain. If the NiV strain was central to person-to-person transmission, then secondary cases of NiV would be more likely to become NiV transmitters, than primary cases (because secondary cases would already have selected for strains predisposed to person-to-person transmission). However, in the review of 7 years of human Nipah infection in Bangladesh, secondary cases were no more or less likely to become Nipah transmitters than were primary cases.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !h self assert = Taken together, this pattern suggests 4 NiV transmitters propagated human infection across 4 generations. There were 67 cases (66 recognized plus the unidentified index case), 4 (5.9%) of whom became Nipah transmitters, a proportion very close to the 7% recognized in Bangladesh. This suggests that the virus strain responsible for this largest recognized person-to-person outbreak was not exceptional.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !i self assert = In each of the 8 Nipah outbreaks investigated in Bangladesh, an association between living near a bat roost and infection with Nipah was looked for but was never found. This suggests that the quantity of viable virus shed in bat urine is too low to initiate clinically apparent infection in humans.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !j self assert = Eating bat-bitten fruit is often suggested as a pathway of transmission for human Nipah infection. NiV was recovered from fruit dropped by Pteropus bats in Malaysia. It is the most commonly suggested pathway for NiV transmission from bats to domestic animals. In contrast to general environmental contamination with urine, punctured fruit contaminated with bat saliva may favor virus survival.

  # / December, 2009 - Clinical Infectious Diseases
  # let !k self assert = The epidemiology of NiV transmission in Bangladesh suggests two avenues to prevent human disease. The first is limiting exposure of Bangladeshi villagers to NiV contaminated fresh date palm sap. A second area for targeted intervention is reducing the exposure of caretakers to the saliva of seriously ill persons. An important research priority is to identify approaches that can be consistently implemented in these low income settings where family members are caring for patients with severe respiratory and neurological disease. For example, family members who washed their hands with soap after caring for Nipah patients were significantly less likely to become infected. If such practices were widely adopted, they would lessen the risk of person-to-person transmission of NiV and other pathogens.

  >>> Abstract
    SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia pandemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon.

The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. It suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader.

  >>> Abstract
    We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.

  # let !b self assert = We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. The genomes of the two types mainly differ at three sites, which are 8750, 28112, and 29063. Based on the nucleotide at the site 29063, the Type I strains can be further divided into Type IA and IB. The number of genomes belonging to Type IA, IB and II are 11, 37, and 121, respectively.

These observations suggest that the outbreak in the Huanan market was triggered by the Type II virus and that the initial transmission of Type I viruses to humans might have occurred somewhere else in Wuhan, probably preceding the outbreak of Type II in the Huanan market.

We speculate that each group was likely from a source of super transmission or super-spreader.

  >>> Abstract
    A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged and is rapidly spreading in humans, causing COVID-19. A key to tackling this pandemic is to understand the receptor recognition mechanism of the virus, which regulates its infectivity, pathogenesis and host range. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—in humans. Here we determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex with ACE2. In comparison with the SARS-CoV RBD, an ACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD–ACE2 interface. These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD increase its ACE2-binding affinity. Additionally, we show that RaTG13, a bat coronavirus that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, also uses human ACE2 as its receptor. The differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 in ACE2 recognition shed light on the potential animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This study provides guidance for intervention strategies that target receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2.

Similar to the SARS-CoV RBM, SARS-CoV-2 RBM forms a gently concave surface with a ridge on one side; it binds to the exposed outer surface of the claw-like structure of ACE2. In comparison to the SARS-CoV RBM, the SARS-CoV-2 RBM forms a larger binding interface and more contacts with ACE2, The overall structural similarity in ACE2 binding by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV supports a close evolutionary relationship between the two viruses.

  # let !b self assert = A marked structural difference between the RBMs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is the conformation of the loops in the ACE2-binding ridge. Specifically, human and civet SARS-CoV strains and bat coronavirus Rs3367 all contain a three-residue motif proline-proline-alanine in this loop; the tandem prolines allow the loop to take a sharp turn. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus RaTG13 both contain a four-residue motif glycine-valine/glutamine-glutamate/threonine-glycine; the two relatively bulky residues and two flexible glycines enable the loop to take a different conformation. Because of these structural differences, an additional main-chain hydrogen bond forms between Asn487 and Ala475 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, causing the ridge to take a more compact conformation and the loop containing Ala475 to move closer to ACE2.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !c self assert = As a consequence, the ridge in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM forms more contacts with the N-terminal helix of ACE2. Moreover, compared with the corresponding Leu472 of the SARS-CoV RBM, Phe486 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM points in a different direction and inserts into a hydrophobic pocket involving Met82, Leu79 and Tyr83 of ACE2. In comparison to the SARS-CoV RBM, these structural changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM are more favourable for ACE2 binding.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !d self assert = To corroborate the structural observations, we characterized ACE2-binding affinities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike that contains mutations in critical ACE2-interacting residues. The SARS-CoV-2 spike contained one of the following RBM changes: 481–487 (481-NGVEGFN-487 in SARS-CoV-2 were mutated to TPPALN as in SARS-CoV), Q493N (Gln493 in SARS-CoV-2 was mutated to an asparagine as in human SARS-CoV), Q493Y (Gln493 in SARS-CoV-2 was mutated to a tyrosine as in bat RaTG13) and N501T (Asn501 in SARS-CoV-2 was mutated to a threonine as in human SARS-CoV). The results showed that all of these introduced mutations reduced the ACE2-binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. They confirm that the structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, including the ACE2-binding ridge and the hotspots-stabilizing residues, all contribute to the high ACE2-binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !e self assert = The results showed that RaTG13 pseudovirus entry into the cells depends on ACE2. Additionally, RaTG13 spike was not cleaved on the pseudovirus surface. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry also depends on ACE2, but its spike was cleaved to S2 on the pseudovirus surface (probably because of a furin site insertion). We found that the RaTG13 spike was pulled down by ACE2. Therefore, similar to SARS-CoV-2, bat RaTG13 binds to human ACE2 and can use human ACE2 as its entry receptor, suggesting that RaTG13 may infect humans. Due to this, one possibility is that there is no intermediate host.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !f self assert = Compared with SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 RBM contains structural changes in the ACE2-binding ridge, largely caused by a four-residue motif (residues 482–485: Gly-Val-Glu-Gly). This structural change allows the ridge to become more compact and form better contacts with the N-terminal helix of ACE2. In addition, Phe486 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM inserts into a hydrophobic pocket. The corresponding residue in the SARS-CoV RBM is a leucine, which probably forms a weaker contact with ACE2 owing to its smaller side chain. Finally, both virus-binding hotspots are more stabilized at the RBM–ACE2 interface through interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 RBM. Neutralizing the charges of the lysines is key to the binding of coronavirus RBDs to ACE2. The SARS-CoV-2 RBM has evolved strategies to stabilize the two hotspots: Gln493 and Leu455 stabilize hotspot 31, whereas Asn501 stabilizes hotspot 353.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !g self assert = Our biochemical data confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a significantly higher ACE2-binding affinity than the SARS-CoV RBD and that the above structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM contribute to the high ACE2-binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Thus, both structural and biochemical data reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognizes ACE2 better than SARS-CoV RBD does.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !h self assert = As with SARS-CoV-2, bat RaTG13 RBM contains a similar four-residue motif in the ACE2-binding ridge, supporting the notion that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from RaTG13 or a RaTG13-related bat coronavirus.

  let !i self assert = The L486F, Y493Q and D501N residue changes from RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2 enhance ACE2 recognition and may have facilitated the bat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Leu455 contributes favourably to ACE2 recognition, and it is conserved between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2; its presence in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM may be important for the bat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the identified receptor-binding features of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM may have facilitated SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from bats to humans.

The RBM of the CoV-pangolin/GD potentially recognizes human ACE2 well, whereas CoV-pangolin/GX does not. Hence, pangolins from Guangdong, but not pangolins from Guangxi, could potentially pass coronaviruses to humans. However, many other factors determine the cross-species transmission of coronaviruses, and the above analysis will need to be verified experimentally.

  # let !k self assert = The RBM of the CoV-pangolin/GD contains Leu455, the 482–485 loop, Phe486, Gln493 and Asn501, all of which are favourable for ACE2 recognition. The RBM of CoV-pangolin/GX contains Leu455 and the 482–485 loop, both of which are favourable for ACE2 recognition, and it also contains Leu486, Glu493 and Thr501, all of which are less favourable for ACE2 recognition.

  # let !l self assert = Finally, this study helps to inform intervention strategies. First, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 RBM can prevent the virus from binding to ACE2, and are therefore promising antiviral drugs.

Thus, this study can help to guide the development and optimization of these antibody drugs. Second, the RBD itself can function as a subunit vaccine. The functionally important epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM that were identified in this study can guide structure-based design of highly efficacious RBD vaccines.

  >>> Abstract
    In a side-by-side comparison of evolutionary dynamics between the 2019/2020 SARS-CoV-2 and the 2003 SARS-CoV, we were surprised to find that SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in the late phase of the 2003 epidemic after SARS-CoV had developed several advantageous adaptations for human transmission. Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.

A considerable portion of SARS-CoV-2 cases are asymptomatic or mild, leading to an underestimation of the virus population size.

In the case of SARS-CoV, the less human-adapted SARS-CoV progenated multiple branches of evolution in both humans and animals.

CoV sampling from more species - to avoid bias stemming from the focused scrutiny of Malayan pangolins - will provide us with a better grasp of the range of species that harbor CoVs with similar RBDs to SARS-CoV-2,as well as the natural diversity of bat CoVs.

The human and civet isolates of the 2003/2004 outbreak, which were collected most closely in time and at the site of cross-species transmission, shared only up to 99.79% S identity. It is therefore unlikely for the January market isolates, which all share 99.9-100% genome and S identity with a December human SARS-CoV-2, to have originated from an intermediate animal host, particularly if the most recent common ancestor jumped into humans as early as October, 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the market samples were most likely from humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were vendors or visitors at the market.

The response to the first SARS-CoV outbreak deployed the following strategies that were key to detecting SARS-CoV adaptation to humans and cross-species transmission, and could be re-applied in today’s outbreak to swiftly eliminate progenitor pools: (i) Sampling animals from markets, farms, and wild populations for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses.

  # let !s self assert = (ii) Checking human samples banked months before late 2019 for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses or SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies to detect precursors circulating in humans. In addition, sequencing more SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Wuhan, particularly early isolates if they still exist, could identify branches originating from a less human-adapted progenitor as was seen in the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. It would be curious if no precursors or branches of SARS-CoV-2 evolution are discovered in humans or animals. (iii) Evaluating the over- or underrepresentation of food handlers and animal traders among the index cases to determine if SARS-CoV-2 precursors may have been circulating in the animal trading community. While these investigations are conducted, it would be safer to more extensively limit human activity that leads to frequent or prolonged contact with wild animals and their habitats.

  >>> Abstract
    We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein amino acid sequence extracted from 11,542 viral genomic sequences submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database through April 27, 2020. Consistent with prior reports, we found a major S protein mutation, D614 to G614, that was represented in 56% of all the analyzed sequences. All other mutations combined were less than 10%. After parsing the data geographically, we found most of the Chinese patient samples showed D614 (97%). By contrast, most patient samples in many European countries showed G614 (51 to 88%). In the United States, the genotypic distribution in California and Washington was similar to Asian countries, while the distribution in other US states was comparable to Europe. We observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of G614 over time in multiple regions, surpassing D614 when both were present, suggesting G614 S protein virus outcompetes D614 S protein virus. To gain insight into the consequences of the D614G mutation, homology modeling using a multi-template threading mechanism with ab initio structural refinement was performed for a region of the S protein (S591 to N710) spanning the D614G mutation and the S1 furin cleavage site. Molecular models of this region containing D614 or G614 revealed a major difference in secondary structure at the furin domain (RRARS, R682 to S686). The D614 model predicted a random coil structure in the furin domain whereas the G614 model predicted an alpha helix. Critical residues in the cleavage domain of G614 model were found to better align with the PDB structure of a furin inhibitor. Thus, homology modeling studies suggest a potential mechanism whereby the D614G mutation may confer a competitive advantage at the furin binding domain that may contribute to the rise of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 mutant.

Interestingly, this mutant S protein appeared early in China (January 24 , 2020), and 4 days later appeared in Germany, but it was not widespread in the data until March where massive infection hit regions like Europe and the Northeastern United States. It is very likely that the virus with the D614G mutation that appeared in the first Chinese and German patients are related. The virus that infected the German patient coincided with the beginning of the spread throughout Europe.

The Wuhan reference sequence was first uploaded early in China and quickly established itself. Wuhan S also appeared early in Japan, California, Washington, and Canada. As of the last sample sequenced in the dataset for these areas, Wuhan S remained the predominant genotype. Frequencies for the Wuhan S and D614G sequences rose to equivalent levels in Wales at which point sampling ceased.

Wuhan S was also found in all European countries at significant levels. However, in multiple countries with similar sampling periods, and where D614G and Wuhan S arose at similar times, D614G became the dominant genotype. In France and Australia, where Wuhan S appeared at least 30 days before D614G, D614G became the predominant genotype at the end of the sampling period.

The earliest sequenced samples in California were predominantly Wuhan S, while the earliest sequenced samples in New York were predominantly D614G. Over time, both sequences appeared in the data across the United States. At the end of the sampling period, California and Washington were predominantly Wuhan S. However, Wuhan S had a much earlier start than D614G.

The closer a substrate is to the transition state orientation, the lower the energetic requirement for cleavage. Therefore, the cleavage of the G614-containing S protein is proposed to be energetically favored over the D614-containing S protein.

This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. These results show SG614 is more stable than SD614, consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with SG614 transmit more efficiently.

  >>> Abstract
    SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates encoding a D614G mutation in the viral spike (S) protein predominate over time in locales where it is found, implying that this change enhances viral transmission. We therefore compared the functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (SD614) and glycine (SG614) at residue 614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with SG614 infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with SD614. This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, SG614 did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than SD614, and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma. These results show SG614 is more stable than SD614, consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with SG614 transmit more efficiently.

Our own analysis of the S-protein sequences showed a similar result: The G614 genotype was not detected in February (among 33 sequences) and observed at low frequency in March (26%), but increased rapidly by April (65%) and May (70%), indicating a transmission advantage over viruses with D614.

  # let !e self assert = The S1:S2 ratio is markedly greater in PVG614 compared to PVD614, indicating that glycine at residue 614 of SG614 stabilizes the interaction between the S1 and S2 domains, limiting S1 shedding. In addition, the total amount of the S protein in PVG614 is also much higher than that in PVD614, as indicated by a denser S2 band, even though the same number of pseudovirions was analyzed, as determined by quantitative PCR. Averages of several quantification show that the S1:S2 ratio of PVG614 is 3.5 times higher than that of PVD614.

The S1:S2 ratio is 3.4 fold higher and the total S protein is nearly five fold enriched in VLPG614 compared to VLPD614. Thus, the D614G mutation enhances virus infection through two related mechanisms: It reduces S1 shedding and increases total S protein incorporated into the virion.

However, the Myc-tag/Flag-tag ratio is similar to the hACE2- NN-Ig/Flag-tag ratio, indicating that increased hACE2 binding to the SG614-expressing cells did not result from increased affinity of SG614 spikes to hACE2 or greater access to the RBD. Instead, these data show there is more S1 domain in the SG614-expressing cells, a result again consistent with the observation that the D614G mutation reduces S1 shedding.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !h self assert = PVD614 and PVG614 are similarly susceptible to neutralizing antisera, indicating that antibody-mediated control of viruses carrying SD614 and SG614 would be similar.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !i self assert = An interesting question is why viruses carrying the more stable SG614 appear to be more transmissible without resulting in a major observable difference in disease severity. It is possible that higher levels of functional S protein observed with SG614 increase the chance of host-to-host transmission, but that other factors limit the rate and efficiency of intra-host replication. Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with SD614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue. It is also possible that our ability to detect sequence changes at this early stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis.

  # / June, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !j self assert = At some point in this process, the virus acquired a furin-cleavage site, allowing its S1/S2 boundary to be cleaved in virus producing cells. In contrast, the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-1, and indeed all SARSlike viruses isolated from bats, lack this polybasic site and are cleaved by TMPRSS2 or endosomal cathepsins in the target cells. Thus the greater stability we observe with SG614 would not be relevant to viruses lacking this site, but it appears to be strongly favored when a furin-cleavage site is present. Therefore, the D614G mutation may have emerged to compensate for this newly acquired furin site.

    Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 µM) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM.

  >>> Abstract
    The coronavirus spike protein (S) plays a key role in the early steps of viral infection, with the S1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the S2 domain mediating membrane fusion. In some cases, the S protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S1–S2 boundary. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S2 domain (S2′, R797). Mutation of R797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell–cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2′ cleavage site within S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2′), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S2′ position allowed trypsin-independent cell–cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S2′), acting in concert with the S1–S2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity.

  # let !b self assert = The amount of fusion increased with the dose of trypsin for the wild-type protein, reaching a plateau at 2 μg/mL trypsin. The mutant R667N was still able to cause cell–cell fusion; however, the fusion was not as efficient as that observed for the wild-type protein (maximum fusion for the mutant was ≈50% of the fusion of the wild-type protein). These data suggest that although the R667 at the S1–S2 boundary does have some role in cleavage activation of SARS-CoV S-mediated membrane fusion, other residues are likely to have more critical roles.

These data suggest that the second cleavage site can be present in the coronavirus S2 domain, which may have important properties for membrane fusion and virus entry.

  # let !e self assert = IBV Beaudette was the only coronavirus for which the ProP server predicted a furin site clearly above threshold within S2. However, analysis of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed a relatively high cleavage potential by furin at the S2′ position, with very limited cleavage potential at the S1–S2 boundary, indicating the possibility of a cryptic cleavage site at the S2′ position. The S2′ site of SARS-CoV S comprises a dibasic motif K796, R797 that could be such a cleavage site, and so we decided to investigate the role of these 2 basic residues in the membrane fusion and entry of SARS-CoV.

  # / April, 2009 - PNAS
  # let !f self assert = Data suggest that SARS-CoV can be proteolytically cleaved at the S2′ position to activate membrane fusion, and that cleavage at the S1–S2 boundary facilitates both cleavage at S2′ (797) and S2′-activated membrane fusion.

Analysis of the role of each residue independently shows that mutation of K796 only partially affected the fusion induced by trypsin (79.5% ± 4.9%), whereas mutation of R797 completely blocked membrane fusion induced by trypsin (2.5% ± 0.8%). The mutation R667N (S1–S2) had limited fusion activity (48.8% ± 2.9%).

As expected, the effect of mutation K796A was weak (84.8% ± 14% of the wild-type level), but mutation of R797 induced a strong decrease of infection induced by trypsin (3.8% ± 2.3% of the wild-type level). Surprisingly, whereas mutation R667N decreased cell–cell fusion induced by trypsin by ≈50%, infection recovery induced by trypsin was strongly impaired (21.4% ± 10.6% of the wild type). This suggests that in the context of the virus infection, cleavage at the S1–S2 boundary may play a more important role than in cell–cell fusion.

  # / April, 2009 - PNAS

We also assessed the effect of the R797N mutation on virus entry in the absence of endosomal acidification. This mutant showed no effect on transduction in the absence of NH4Cl and trypsin, indicating that R797 is not a critical residue for the endosomal route of SARS-CoV entry, which is presumably primed by cathepsin L cleavage.

The lack of effect of furin cleavage on virion infectivity mirrors that observed in the normally cleaved S glycoprotein of the murine coronavirus and highlights an additional level of complexity in coronavirus entry.

  >>> Abstract
    The fusogenic potential of Class I viral envelope glycoproteins is activated by proteloytic cleavage of the precursor glycoprotein to generate the mature receptor-binding and transmembrane fusion subunits. Although the coronavirus (CoV) S glycoproteins share membership in this class of envelope glycoproteins, cleavage to generate the respective S1 and S2 subunits appears absent in a subset of CoV species, including that responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To determine whether proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein might be important for the newly emerged SARS-CoV, we introduced a furin recognition site at single basic residues within the putative S1–S2 junctional region. We show that furin cleavage at the modified R667 position generates discrete S1 and S2 subunits and potentiates membrane fusion activity. This effect on the cell–cell fusion activity by the S glycoprotein is not, however, reflected in the infectivity of pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the cleaved glycoprotein. The lack of effect of furin cleavage on virion infectivity mirrors that observed in the normally cleaved S glycoprotein of the murine coronavirus and highlights an additional level of complexity in coronavirus entry.

By contrast, furin-mediated cleavage of the S glycoprotein at a more C-terminal recognition motif, RNTR761, does not appear to affect fusogenicity. Although cleavage at these sites has previously been reported, our studies demonstrate the importance of the SLLR667 cleavage in fusion competence of the S glycoprotein. This finding is in agreement with the evolutionary homology in this S1–S2 junctional region among CoV species

  let !e self assert = Interestingly, inhibition of furin activity by a peptidic furin inhibitor has recently been reported to prevent the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV infection in cell culture. Nonetheless, other proteolytic enzymes have also been implicated in CoV entry. The recent finding that SARS-CoV entry can be blocked by a specific inhibitor of cathepsin L highlights the possible role of endosomal proteases. The multiple opportunities for proteolytic activation of the S glycoprotein in natural infection remain to be examined.

  # / July, 2006 - Virology
  # let !f self assert = Despite a reasonable correlation between proteolytic cleavage and membrane fusion activity in both the naturally cleaved and uncleaved S glycoproteins, the presence or absence of furin cleavage appears to have surprisingly little impact on the infectivity of the virion particle.

  let !g self assert = The ability of the R667S mutant to promote cell–cell fusion was consistently reduced to 60% of wild-type levels. Fusion by the K672S mutant was largely unaffected.

  # let !j self assert =  Proteolytic processing of the HTVR, HTR and SLLR glycoproteins was abrogated in the furin-deficient FD11 cell line. The S1 and S2 subunits were absent in FD11 cells, and S1 was not detected in the cell culture medium. These findings provide evidence that proteolytic cleavage in the furin-site-containing mutants is indeed mediated by the furin protease.

  # / July, 2006 - Virology
  # let !k self assert = Consistent with this finding, only cells expressing the wild-type and K672S glycoproteins were able to shed S1 glycoprotein to the cell culture medium. These findings suggest that the furin-mediated cleavage event at R667 is disrupted by the substitution of serine and, importantly, is responsible for the generation of the S1 subunit in the wild-type and HTVR glycoproteins. By contrast, the larger S1-like fragment thought to represent cleavage at the RNTR site at position 758–761 was produced and shed by both the R667S and K672S mutants and by the wild-type glycoprotein.

  # let !l self assert = Despite the dramatic differences observed in assays of cell–cell fusion, pseudotyped virions bearing the co-S Δ19 or co-HTVR Δ19 glycoprotein were equally infectious. Expression of the ACE2 receptor remained essential for entry. Thus, the enhanced facility of the furin-cleaved HTVR glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion is apparently not reflected in the overall process of virion entry. The disconnect between the membrane fusion activity of the S glycoprotein and its ability to mediate viral entry, demonstrated here in the normally uncleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and previously in the normally cleaved glycoprotein of MHV, highlights unresolved complexities in the pathway used by CoVs to infect target cells.

    The unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China and beyond has had major public health impacts on a global scale. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the origins of the virus remain unclear.

Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses.

  # / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  # let !c self assert = In contrast, RmYN02 was closely related to SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting 93.3% nucleotide sequence identity, although it was less similar to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13 (96.1%) across the genome as a whole. RmYN02 and SARS-CoV-2 were extremely similar (>96% sequence identity) in most genomic regions (e.g., 1ab, 3a, E, 6, 7a, N, and 10). In particular, RmYN02 was 97.2% identical to SARS-CoV-2 in the longest encoding gene region, 1ab (21,285 nucleotides).

  let !c self assert = RmYN02 exhibited far lower sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 in the S gene (nucleotide 71.8%, amino acid 72.9%). Strikingly, RmYN02 only possessed 62.4% amino acid identity to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Strikingly, RmYN02 only possessed 62.4% amino acid identity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), whereas the pangolin beta-CoV from Guangdong had amino acid identity of 97.4%, and was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in this region.

  let !e self assert = The amino acid deletions in RmYN02 RBD made two loops near the receptor binding site that are shorter than those in SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, the conserved disulfide bond in the external subdomain of SARS-CoV (PDB: 2DD8), SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LZG), RaTG13, pangolin/MP789/2019, and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017 was missing in RmYN02. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions, including RmYN02, ZXC21, and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !f self assert = In contrast, RaTG13, pangolin/MP789/2019, and pangolin/P5L/2017 did not have the deletions, and had similar conformations at their external domains, indicating that they may also use ACE2 as cell receptor, although with the exception of pangolin/MP789/2019, all exhibited amino acid variation to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus showed highly structural homology with SARS-CoV-2.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !g self assert = Pangolin/MP789/2019 possessed the identical amino acid residues to SARS-CoV-2 at all six positions. In contrast, RaTG13, RmYN02, and RmYN01 possessed the same amino acid residue as SARS-CoV-2 at only one of the six positions each (RaTG13, L455; RmYN02, Y505; RmYN01, Y505), despite RaTG13 being the closest relative in the spike protein. Such an evolutionary pattern is indicative of a complex combination of recombination and natural selection.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !h self assert = Notably, SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a four-amino-acid insertion at the junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs. This insertion, which represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and is present in all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in RmYN02 is therefore of major importance. Although the inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats) strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely been acquired by recombination. As such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.

  # / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  # let !i self assert = We next performed a phylogenetic analysis of RmYN02, RaTG13, SARS-CoV-2, and the pangolin beta-CoVs. The pangolin beta-CoVs formed two well-supported sub-lineages, representing animal seized by anti-smuggling authorities in Guangxi (pangolin-CoV/GX) and Guangdong (pangolin-CoV/GD) provinces. However, whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these viruses, or they acquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife, requires further sampling.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !j self assert = More notable was that RmYN02 was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in most of the virus genome, although these two viruses were still separated from each other by a relatively long branch length. In the spike gene tree, SARS-CoV-2 clustered with RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, suggesting that the latter virus has experienced recombination in this gene.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !k self assert = In phylogeny of the RBD, SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related to pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in more divergent positions, again indicative of recombination.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !l self assert = Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, revealed that RmYN02, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-2 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses. We confirmed the bat host of RmYN02, Rhinolophus malayanus, by analyzing the sequence of the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene from the NGS data; this revealed 100% sequence identity to a Rhinolophus malayanus isolate.

  # / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  # let !m self assert = Both Rhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely distributed in southwest China and southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highly gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate the exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. Notably, RaTG13 was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, but feasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can utilize cave environments.

  / May, 2020 - Current Biology
  let !n self assert = Our study reaffirms that bats, particularly those of the genus Rhinolophus, are important natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and currently harbor the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2, although this picture may change with increased wildlife sampling.

  >>> Abstract
    Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary. For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARSCoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.

  # let !d self assert = Variant sites were called by using iVar7 with depth >=20 as a threshold. With this method, 10 of 21 cell isolate strains have different ratios of variants (>10%) with deletion at the flank of the polybasic cleavage site (deletion at 23585–23599). One has the variant with deletion on the polybasic cleavage site (deletion at 23596–23617). The deletion is commonly identified in cell isolated strains: the strains with a relative higher ratio of this deletion were dispersed in the phylogenetic tree suggesting the deletion mutation was not restricted to a specific genetic lineage of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

  # / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !e self assert = There were 68 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with sequencing average depth >=20 at the sites neighboring 23585. The variants with the deletion at 23585-23599 were found in 3 (6%) of clinical samples with ratios ranging from 8.8–32.8% indicating this deletion may also occur in vivo infections even though the rate was extremely low compared to the results from in vitro. To date, there are no genome sequences deposited in public dataset having this deletion.

  # / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  # let !f self assert = For SARs-CoV-1, strong positive selection has been identified in the spike coding sequence and deletions in the other gene segment at the early stage but not the late stage of the epidemic, suggesting the adaptive pressures operated on the SARS-CoV-1 genome at the beginning of the epidemic. This result also indicates the SARs-CoV-1 may not well established in the human population at the early stage when it first transmitted from an intermediate animal host. For SARs-CoV-2, the virus presents high infectivity and efficient transmission capability among the human population since it is firstly identified. Genetic changes related with viral fitness of SARs-CoV-2 require further epidemiological investigation and functional experiments.

  / April, 2020 - bioRxiv
  let !h self assert = Notably, a recently reported SARs-like strain RmYN02, which is phylogenetically related to a SARS-CoV-2, also has a deletion at the QTQT site. This raises another possible scenario, which is that SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in animals may not have QTQTN in their spike protein and a variant with this insertion occurred upon virus transmission into humans.

  head = Our data support the concept that pre-cleavage of MERS-S at the S1/S2 site by furin promotes subsequent S protein activation by TMPRSS2. However, pre-cleavage was not essential for S protein activation by TMPRSS2 and Caco-2 cell entry driven by a MERS-S variant lacking pre-cleavage was still TMPRSS2 dependent. Moreover, our results suggest that the S2′ site, specifically the second arginine, is important for efficient S protein activation by TMPRSS2 and indicate that cathepsin L but not TMPRSS2 can employ alternative sites for S protein activation.

  >>> Abstract
    The Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe disease and has pandemic potential. Therefore, development of antiviral strategies is an important task. The activation of the viral spike protein (S) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential therapeutic targets. The cellular proteases furin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 can activate MERS-S and may cleave the S protein at two distinct sites, termed S1/S2 and S2′. Moreover, a potential cathepsin L cleavage site in MERS-S has been reported. However, the relative importance of these sites for MERS-S activation is incompletely understood. Here, we used mutagenic analysis and MERS-S-bearing vectors to study the contribution of specific cleavage sites to S protein-driven entry. We found that an intact S1/S2 site was only required for efficient entry into cells expressing endogenous TMPRSS2. In keeping with a previous study, pre-cleavage at the S1/S2 motif (RSVR) was important although not essential for subsequent MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, and indirect evidence was obtained that this motif is processed by a protease depending on an intact RXXR motif, most likely furin. In contrast, the S2′ site (RSAR) was required for robust viral entry into all cell lines tested and the integrity of one of the two arginines was sufficient for efficient entry. These findings suggest that cleavage at S2′ is carried out by proteases recognizing a single arginine, most likely TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Finally, mutation of the proposed cathepsin L site did not impact viral entry and double mutation of S1/S2 and S2′ site was compatible with cathepsin L- but not TMPRSS2-dependent host cell entry, indicating that cathepsin L can process the S protein at auxiliary sites. Collectively, our results indicate a rigid sequence requirement for S protein activation by TMPRSS2 but not cathepsin L.

Uncleaved as well as cleaved forms of the S protein were detected in particles, with the exception of mutants with altered S1/S2 site, which exclusively incorporated uncleaved S protein. Thus, alteration of the S1/S2, cathepsin L and S2′ sites is compatible with particle incorporation of the S protein and only mutation of S1/S2 site abrogates S protein processing in particle producing cells.

  # let !e self assert = All cell lines analyzed as well as lung tissue expressed cathepsin L and furin mRNA, in keeping with the previously documented broad expression of these enzymes27,28, although cathepsin L levels in Vero E6 cells were relatively low. In contrast, robust levels of TMPRSS2 mRNA were only found in Caco-2 cells and lung tissue, again in agreement with published data29. Finally, all cell lines and lung tissue were positive for DPP4 mRNA, with Caco-2 cells expressing the highest levels, and transfection of DPP4 expression plasmid revealed that the low amounts of endogenous DPP4 in 293T cells limit the efficiency of S protein driven entry.

Moreover, residual entry of the S1/S2 mutant into Caco-2 cells was not facilitated by cathepsin L, as one would have expected from previous work with Calu-3 and Huh7/TMPRSS2 cells16, but remained TMPRSS2 dependent. Whether these discrepancies reflect cell line specific differences remains to be determined.

  # / November, 2018 - Scientific Reports
  # let !g self assert = It is noteworthy that Caco-2 cell entry driven by the S protein of SARS-CoV also relied on TMPRSS2 while entry driven by the glycoprotein of Ebola virus, which is known to depend on cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity, was blocked by the cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL28170. Thus, active cathepsin L seems to be expressed in Caco-2 cells. Finally, our results suggest that the second arginine at the S2′ site might be essential for MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, since mutation of this residue markedly reduced S protein-driven entry into Caco-2 cells, while mutation of the first arginine did not diminish entry efficiency.

  # / November, 2018 - Scientific Reports
  # let !h self assert = Efficient MERS-S-driven entry into Vero E6, 293T and 293T+DPP4 cells was facilitated by cathepsin L and was largely independent of the S1/S2 site but required an intact S2′ site, in keeping with cleavage of this site being required for liberation of the N-terminus of the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit.

  head = We observed a series of deleted mutants (Del-muts) and point mutation variants in Vero-E6 cell cultures of a clinical isolate. In a challenging trial in hamsters, Del-mut-1 variant in infected hamsters does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases, and a potential as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool.

  >>> Abstract
    The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and more than one million infections since December 2019. The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.

  # let !a self assert = We found multiple variants containing in-frame deletions from 15 to 30 nucleotides and point mutations in the S1/S2 junction. One of the variants contains an in-frame 30-bp deletion which spanned genome coordinates 2035–2064 of the spike region in all small plaque-forming viruses sequenced (Del-mut-1), while no deletion was found in isolates that formed large plaques (WT). Besides this 30-bp deletion, no other deletion or mutation was found in Del-mut-1. Sequence alignment of amino acids shows that this 30-bp deletion is located at the S1/S2 junction. Notably, this deletion removes the PRRA motif from the S1/S2 junction region of the spike protein.

  // Pangolins Lack IFIH1/MDA5, a Cytoplasmic RNA Sensor That Initiates Innate Immune Defense Upon Coronavirus Infection
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00939
  ref 'Fischer_et_al_05_08_2020
  head = Pangolins are another group of mammals with evolutionarily downregulated defense against a subset of viruses, namely those sensed by IFIH1/MDA5 or ZBP1 in other species. The loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of infections by certain RNA viruses, including coronaviruses in pangolins.

  >>> Abstract
    Zoonotic infections are an imminent threat to human health. Pangolins were recently identified as carriers and intermediate hosts of coronaviruses. Previous research has shown that infection with coronaviruses activates an innate immune response upon sensing of viral RNA by interferon-induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), also known as MDA5. Here, we performed a comparative genomics study of RNA sensor genes in three species of pangolins. DDX58/RIG-I, a sensor of cytoplasmic viral RNA and toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 8, which bind RNA in endosomes, are conserved in pangolins. By contrast, IFIH1 a sensor of intracellular double-stranded RNA, has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins. Likewise, Z-DNA-binding protein (ZBP1), which senses both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, has been lost during the evolution of pangolins. These results suggest that the innate immune response to viruses differs significantly between pangolins and other mammals, including humans. We put forward the hypothesis that loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins.

DDX58/RIG-I, a sensor of cytoplasmic viral RNA and toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 8, which bind RNA in endosomes, are conserved in pangolins. By contrast, IFIH1 a sensor of intracellular double-stranded RNA, has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins. Likewise, Z-DNA-binding protein (ZBP1), which senses both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, has been lost during the evolution of pangolins.

DDX58 contains in-frame stop codons and frameshift mutations in the tree pangolin (M. tricuspis) but not in the Chinese pangolin (M. pentadactyla), suggesting that the tree pangolin lacks functional DDX58/RIG-I in addition to the two intracellular RNA sensors (IFIH1 and ZBP1) absent in all pangolins.

Other genes implicated in anti-RNA-viral defense are conserved in the selected set of species.

  >>> Abstract
    Outbreaks of emerging coronaviruses in the past two decades and the current pandemic of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China highlight the importance of this viral family as a zoonotic public health threat. To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84/151). Coronaviruses were detected in the majority of wildlife farms (60.7%, 17/28) and in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6/96) that are farmed. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people.

  >>> Abstract
    T-cell receptors recognize peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC). The ability of the T-cell receptor (TCR) to recognize more than one peptide-MHC structure defines cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity is a documented phenomenon of the immune system whose importance is still under investigation. There are a number of rational arguments for cross-reactivity. These include the discrepancy between the theoretical high number of pathogen-derived peptides and the lower diversity of the T-cell repertoire, the need for recognition of escape variants, and the intrinsic low affinity of this receptor−ligand pair. However, quantifying the phenomenon has been difficult, and its immunological importance remains unknown. In this review, we examined the cases for and against an important role for cross reactivity. We argue that it may be an essential feature of the immune system from the point of view of biological robustness.

  >>> Abstract
    The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic calls for the rapid development of diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity is central for control of and protection from viral infections. A prerequisite to characterize T-cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines and immunotherapies, is the identification of the exact viral T-cell epitopes presented on human leukocyte antigens (HLA). This is the first work identifying and characterizing SARS-CoV-2-specific and cross-reactive HLA class I and HLA-DR T-cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 convalescents (n = 180) as well as unexposed individuals (n = 185) and confirming their relevance for immunity and COVID-19 disease course. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell epitopes enabled detection of post-infectious T-cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescents. Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes revealed preexisting T-cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals, and validation of similarity to common cold human coronaviruses provided a functional basis for postulated heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intensity of T-cell responses and recognition rate of T-cell epitopes was significantly higher in the convalescent donors compared to unexposed individuals, suggesting that not only expansion, but also diversity spread of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses occur upon active infection. Whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with severity of symptoms in our SARS-CoV-2 donors, intensity of T-cell responses did not negatively affect COVID-19 severity. Rather, diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses was increased in case of mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that development of immunity requires recognition of multiple SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental rather than reservoir hosts of coronaviruses.

  >>> Abstract
    The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families – Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our ‘upstream’ market chain samples suggests that these detections in ‘downstream’ animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.

  >>> Abstract
    The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 poses unprecedent public health challenges to both China and the rest world1. The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.

Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity in the receptor-binding domain to SARS-CoV-2.

  >>> Abstract
    The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and across the world is associated with a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-21. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection2. Although bats are probable reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the identity of any intermediate host that may have facilitated transfer to humans is unknown. Here we report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity in the receptor-binding domain to SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of new coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.

  let !b self assert = High-throughput sequencing of the RNA of these samples revealed the presence of coronaviruses in 6 out of 43 samples (2 lung samples, 2 intestinal samples, 1 lung–intestine mixed sample and 1 blood sample from 5 individual pangolins). We were able to obtain six complete or near complete genome sequences—denoted GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L—that fall into the SARS-CoV-2 lineage (within the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae) in a phylogenetic analysis.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !c self assert = The genome sequence of the virus isolate (GX/P2V) has a very high similarity (99.83–99.92%) to the five sequences that were obtained through the metagenomic sequencing of the raw samples, and all samples have similar genomic organizations to SARS-CoV-2, with eleven predicted open-reading frames (ORFs).

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !d self assert = We conducted further qPCR testing on another batch of archived pangolin samples collected between May and July 2018. Among the 19 samples (9 intestine tissues, 10 lung tissues) tested from 12 animals, 3 lung tissue samples from 3 individual pangolins were positive for coronavirus.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !e self assert = In addition to the animals from Guangxi, after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak researchers of the Guangzhou Customs Technology Center re-examined five archived pangolin samples (two skin swabs, two unknown tissue samples and one scale) obtained in anti-smuggling operations performed in March 2019. Following high-throughput sequencing, the scale sample was found to contain coronavirus reads, and from these data we assembled a partial genome sequence of 21,505 bp (denoted as GD/P2S), representing approximately 72% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Notably, this virus sequence, obtained from a pangolin scale sample, may in fact be derived from contaminants of other infected tissues.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !f self assert = These pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85.5% to 92.4% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2, and represent two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which (comprising GD/P1L and GD/P2S) is very closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !g self assert = It has previously been noted that members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus have experienced widespread recombination. In support of this, a recombination analysis revealed that bat coronaviruses ZC45 and ZXC21 are probably recombinants, containing genome fragments derived from multiple SARS-CoV-related lineages (genome regions 2, 5 and 7) as well as SARS-CoV-2-related lineages, including segments from pangolin coronaviruses (regions 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8).

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !h self assert = More notable, however, was the observation of putative recombination signals between the pangolin coronaviruses, bat coronavirus RaTG13 and human SARS-CoV-2. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (97.4% amino acid similarity), even though it is most closely related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 in the remainder of the viral genome.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !i self assert = The Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 possess identical amino acids at the five critical residues of the RBD, whereas RaTG13 only shares one amino acid with SARS-CoV-2 (residue 442, according to numbering of the human SARS-CoV) and these latter two viruses have only 89.2% amino acid similarity in the RBD.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !j self assert = Notably, a phylogenetic analysis of synonymous sites only from the RBD revealed that the topological position of the Guangdong pangolin is consistent with that of the remainder of the viral genome, rather than being the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to differentiate between these scenarios on the basis of the current data. This observation is consistent with the fact that the sequence similarity of ACE2 is higher between humans and pangolins (84.8%) than between humans and bats (80.8–81.4% for Rhinolophus sp.)

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !k self assert = The occurrence of recombination and/or convergent evolution further highlights the role that intermediate animal hosts have in the emergence of viruses that can infect humans.

  # / March, 2020 - Nature
  # let !l self assert = All of the pangolin coronaviruses identified to date lack the insertion of a polybasic (furin-like) S1/S2 cleavage site in the spike protein that distinguishes human SARS-CoV-2 from related betacoronaviruses (including RaTG13) and that may have helped to facilitate the emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 through human populations.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !m self assert = On the basis of the current data it cannot be excluded that pangolins acquired their SARS-CoV-2-related viruses independently from bats or another animal host. Therefore, their role in the emergence of human SARS-CoV-2 remains to be confirmed. In this context, it is noteworthy that both lineages of pangolin coronaviruses were obtained from trafficked Malayan pangolins, which originated from Southeast Asia, and that there is a marked lack of knowledge of the viral diversity maintained by this species in regions in which it is indigenous.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !n self assert = The repeated occurrence of infections with SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces suggests that this animal may have an important role in the community ecology of coronaviruses.

  / March, 2020 - Nature
  let !o self assert = Although the epidemiology, pathogenicity, interspecies infectivity and transmissibility of coronaviruses in pangolins remains to be studied, the data presented here strongly suggests that handling these animals requires considerable caution and their sale in wet markets should be strictly prohibited.

  head = In this study, we assembled the complete genome of a coronavirus identified in 3 sick Malayan pangolins and our results showed that pangolin-CoV-2020 is genetically associated with both SARS-CoV-2 and a group of bat coronaviruses. There is a high sequence identity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2. However, phylogenetic analyses and a special amino acid sequence in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 did not support the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 arising directly from the pangolin-CoV-2020.

  >>> Abstract
    The outbreak of a novel corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 1.7 million laboratory confirmed cases all over the world. Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 was likely originated from bats, but its intermediate hosts are still largely unknown. In this study, we assembled the complete genome of a coronavirus identified in 3 sick Malayan pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that this pangolin coronavirus (pangolin-CoV-2020) is genetically related to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as a group of bat coronaviruses but do not support the SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from the pangolin-CoV-2020. Our study suggests that pangolins are natural hosts of Betacoronaviruses. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. In addition to conservation of wildlife, minimizing the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to reduce the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.

  let !b self assert = In March and July of 2019, we detected Betacoronaviruses in three individuals from two sets of smuggled Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (n = 27) that were intercepted by Guangdong customs. Through metagenomic sequencing and de novo assembling, we recovered 38 contigs ranging from 380 to 3,377 nucleotides, and the nucleotide sequence identity among the contigs from these three samples were 99.54%.

  # / May, 2020 - PLOS Pathogens
  # let !b self assert = After that, gap filling with amplicon sequencing was conducted to obtain a nearly full genome sequence. This pangolin-CoV-2020 genome (Genbank No.: MT121216) was found to be comprised of 29,521 nucleotides.

  let !c self assert = Strikingly, genomic analyses suggested the pangolin-CoV-2020 has a high identity with both SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13, the proposed origin of SARS-CoV-2. The nucleotide sequence identity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2 was 90.32%, whereas the protein sequence identity for individual proteins can be up to 100%. The nucleotide sequence identity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 90.24%, while that for the corresponding regions between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 96.18%

Further analyses suggested the S gene was relatively more genetically diverse in the S1 region than the S2 region. Compared with their nucleotide sequences, the S proteins of pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2 were more conserved, with a sequence identity of 90.18%.

  / May, 2020 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !e self assert = The receptor binding domains (RBD) of the S protein were highly conserved between pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences identity of RBD of S gene between them was highest in comparison with those between pangolin-CoV-2020 and other SARS-like conronaviruses of 86.64% and 96.80%.

  / May, 2020 - PLOS Pathogens
  let !g self assert = These results support that pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2 share the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Further analyses suggested that there was one variation (Gln498) between the RBM of pangolin-CoV-2020 and that of SARS-CoV-2 but conserved in all other key residues being associated with receptor binding (Gly482, Val483, Glu484, Gly485, Phe486, Gln493, Leu455, Asn501), suggesting a potential binding affinity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and human ACE2 receptor.

  # let !h self assert = On the other hand, unlike RBD, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity of NTD (N-terminal domain) were only 66.2% and 63.1% identical between pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV-2. However, a loci Arg408 from the RBD core of SARS-CoV-2 could form a hydrogen bond with human ACE2 was conserved in pangolin-CoV-2020.

  let !j self assert = Genomic analyses suggested sequence similarities were not homogeneous across the S genes of pangolin-CoV-2020, SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV-ZXC21 and Bat-CoV-ZC45. For example, the first S region (i.e., nucleotides 1–1200) of pangolin-CoV-2020 has a higher nucleotide identity to two bat viruses (Bat-CoV-ZXC21 and Bat-CoV-ZC45) than SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13, whereas the remaining S gene of pangolin-CoV-2020 is opposite. These results suggest that a recombination event could have occurred during the evolution of these coronaviruses.

We found high viral diversity of dead Malayan pangolins, and the Sendai virus and Coronavirus may be the dominant pathogens responsible for their death. The Sendai virus showed a close relationship between the Malayan pangolin and the strain isolated from humans, whereas Coronavirus sequences showed a high species diversity.

    Pangolins are endangered animals in urgent need of protection. Identifying and cataloguing the viruses carried by pangolins is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential pathogens and help with conservation. This study provides insight into viral communities of Malayan Pangolins (Manis javanica) as well as the molecular epidemiology of dominant pathogenic viruses between Malayan Pangolin and other hosts. A total of 62,508 de novo assembled contigs were constructed, and a BLAST search revealed 3600 ones (≥300 nt) were related to viral sequences, of which 68 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses, while dominant viruses were the Sendai virus and Coronavirus. This is the first report on the viral diversity of pangolins, expanding our understanding of the virome in endangered species, and providing insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into other mammals

  head = Very few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant proportion of them had been infected with the virus. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.

  >>> Background
    It is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China.

  >>> Methods
    We included the following four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29, 2020: 1470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, 3832 healthcare providers without COVID-19 diagnosis, 19555 general workers, and 1616 other patients to be admitted to the hospital (N=26473). COVID-19 patients who received IgM/IgG tests <21 days after symptom onset were excluded.

  >>> Results
    IgG prevalence was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) in healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) in general workers, and 1.0% in other patients (p all <0.001 for comparisons with COVID-19 patients). IgG prevalence increased significantly by age among healthcare workers and general workers. Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% in healthcare providers, 1.3% in general workers, and 0.2% in other patients.

  >>> Conclusions
    Very few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant proportion of them had been infected with the virus. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.

The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys.

  >>> Abstract
    The clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been well described. We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT–PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People’s Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15–26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6–10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8–38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys.

  head = The observation that plasma neutralizing activity is low in most convalescent individuals, but that recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies with potent neutralizing activity can be found in individuals with unexceptional plasma neutralizing activity suggests that humans are intrinsically capable of generating anti-RBD antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Thus, vaccines that selectively and efficiently induce antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD may be especially effective.

  >>> Abstract
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titres: less than 1:50 in 33% and below 1:1,000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titres above 1:5,000. Antibody sequencing revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) as low as single digit nanograms per millitre. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.

Among other antibody features, IGH CDR3 length was indistinguishable from the reported norm and hydrophobicity was below average.

  # let !h self assert = As is the case with other human pathogens, there were expanded clones of viral antigen binding B cells in all COVID-19 individuals tested. Overall, 32.2% of the recovered IGH and IGL sequences were from clonally expanded B cells (range 21.8-57.4% across individuals). Antibodies that shared specific combinations of IGHV and IGLV genes in different individuals comprised 14% ofall the clonal sequences. Remarkably, the amino acid sequences of some antibodies found in different individuals were nearly identical . For example, antibodies expressed by clonally expanded B cells with IGHV1-58/IGKV3-20 and IGHV3-30-3/ IGKV1-39 found repeatedly in different individuals had amino acid.

A fraction of these (7 out of 77 that were tested, or 9%) cross-reacted with the RBD of SARS-CoV with EC50s below 1μg/mL. No significant cross-reactivity was noted to the RBDs of MERS HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E or HCoV-NL63.

A subset of the most potent of these antibodies were also tested against authentic SARS-CoV-2 and neutralized with IC50s of less than 5 ng/ml. Only two of the antibodies which cross-reacted with the RBD of SARS-CoV showed significant neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV pseudovirus.

We conclude that even individuals with modest plasma neutralizing activity harbor rare IgG memory B cells that produce potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

Groups 1 and 2 also bind after Group 3, and Groups 1 and 2 differ in that Group 1 can bind after Group 2 but not vice versa.

  // Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19

  ref 'Zhang_et_al_06_11_2020
  head = Our results show that the airborne transmission route, particularly via nascent aerosols from human atomization, is highly virulent and dominant for the spread of COVID-19. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public.

  >>> Abstract
    Various mitigation measures have been implemented to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing and mandated face covering. However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !a self assert = Our analysis indicates that face covering reduced the number of infections by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and by over 66,000 in NYC from April 17 to May 9.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !a self assert = In addition, varying the correlation from 15 d to 30 d prior to the onset of the implementation reveals little difference in the projection for both places, because of the high correlation coefficients. Notably, the trends of the infection curves in Italy and NYC contrast to those in the world and in the United States, which show little deviation from the linearity due to the non implementation of face-covering measures globally and nationally, respectively.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !b self assert = The inability of social distancing, quarantine, and isolation alone to curb the spread of COVID-19 is also evident from the linearity of the infection curve prior to the onset of the face-covering rule in Italy on April 6 and in NYC on April 17. Hence, the difference made by implementing face covering significantly shapes the pandemic trends worldwide.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !c self assert = We further compared the numbers of daily new cases between NYC and the United States (excluding the data in NYC) from March 1 to May 9. The decreasing rate in the daily new infections in NYC with mandated face covering is in sharp contrast to that in the United States with only social-distancing and stay-at-home measures, further confirming the importance of face covering in intervening the virus transmission.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !d self assert = While similar quarantine, isolation, and city lockdown measures were also implemented on March 9 in Italy after the country became the second epicenter, the curve of infections has yet to show complete flattening. In the United States, guidelines for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation were issued by the federal government on March 16, and stay-at-home orders were implemented by many state and local governments starting, for example, on March 19 and April 3 and on March 22 in NYC. The social distancing measures implemented in the United States include staying at least 6 feet away from other people, no gathering in groups, staying out of crowded places, and avoiding mass gatherings. Obviously, the continuous rise in the US infected numbers casts doubt on the effectiveness of those preventive measures alone. In contrast to China, wearing of face masks was not mandated and was unpopular in most of the western world during the early outbreak of the pandemic.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !e self assert = With measures implemented in the United States seemingly comparable to those in China, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation exhibited little impact on stopping the spreading of the disease in the United States, as reflected by the linearity from April 1 to May 9. It is possible, however, that these measures likely alter the slope of the infection curve, that is, by reducing the rate of infections during the early stage of the pandemic.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !f self assert = Notably, the recommended physical separation for social distancing is beneficial to prevent direct contact transmission but is insufficient (without face masks) to protect inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols (or even small droplets at intermediate proximity), owing to rapid air mixing.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !g self assert = Specifically, while the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have emphasized the prevention of contact transmission, both WHO and CDC have largely ignored the importance of the airborne transmission route. The current mitigation measures, such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !g self assert = With social distancing, quarantine, and isolation in place worldwide and in the United States since the beginning of April, airborne transmission represents the only viable route for spreading the disease, when mandated face covering is not implemented. Similarly, airborne transmission also contributes dominantly to the linear increase in the infection prior to the onset of mandated face covering in Italy and NYC. Hence, the unique function of face covering to block atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols accounts for the significantly reduced infections in China, Italy, and NYC, indicating that airborne transmission of COVID-19 represents the dominant route for infection.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !h self assert = Within an enclosed environment, virus-bearing aerosols from human atomization are readily accumulated, and elevated levels of airborne viruses facilitate transmission from person to person. Transmission of airborne viruses in open air is subject to dilution, although virus accumulation still occurs due to stagnation under polluted urban conditions

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !i self assert = Removal of virus-bearing particles from human atomization via deposition is strongly size dependent, with the settling velocities ranging from 2.8 × 10−5 m⋅s−1 to 1.4 × 10−3 m⋅s−1 for the sizes of 1 and 10 μm, respectively. For comparison, typical wind velocity is about 1 m⋅s−1 to 3 m⋅s−1 indoors and is ∼1 m⋅s−1 horizontally and 0.1 m⋅s−1 vertically in stable air. Under those indoor and outdoor conditions, the residence time of virus-bearing aerosols reaches hours, due to air mixing.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !j self assert = The airborne transmission pathways (i.e., indoor or outdoor) as well as the effects of ambient PM2.5 levels on virus transmission may be variable among urban cities. For example, the winter haze conditions in China likely exacerbated outdoor virus spreading, because of low UV radiation, air stagnation (lacking ventilation on the city scale), and low temperature. Also, there may exist a synergetic effect of simultaneous exposure to the virus and PM2.5 to enhance the infectivity, severity, and fatalities of the disease

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !k self assert = While the humidity effect on viral surviving is uncertain, the conditions during the outbreaks in Wuhan, Rome, and NYC correspond to high RH yet low absolute humidity because of low temperature. Early experimental work showed remarkable survival for the analogous coronavirus MERS-CoV at the RH level characteristic of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, Rome, and NYC. For comparison, indoor temperature and RH typically range from 21 °C to 27 °C and 20 to 70%, respectively.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !l self assert = Of particular importance are the considerations that render airborne SARS-CoV-2 the most efficient among all transmission routes. Even with normal nasal breathing, inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols results in deep and continuous deposition into the human respiratory tract, and this transmission route typically requires a low dose.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !m self assert = Also, airborne viruses have great mobility and sufficiently long surviving time for dispersion, and residents situated in densely populated environments are highly vulnerable.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !n self assert = In addition, nascent micrometer-size aerosols produced from coughing/sneezing of infected people have the potential of containing many viruses, particularly for asymptomatic carriers.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !o self assert = In the United States, social distancing and stay-at-home measures, in conjunction with hand sanitizing, were implemented during the early stage of the pandemic (March 16). These measures minimized short-range contact transmission but did not prevent long-range airborne transmission, responsible for the inefficient containing of the pandemic in the United States. Mandated face covering, such as those implemented in China, Italy, and NYC, effectively prevented airborne transmission by blocking atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols and contact transmission by blocking viral shedding of droplets.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !p self assert = While the combined face-covering and social distancing measures offered dual protection against the virus transmission routes, the timing and sequence in implementing the measures also exhibited distinct outcomes during the pandemic. For example, social distancing measures, including city lockdown and stay-at-home orders, were implemented well before face covering was mandated in Italy and NYC, and this sequence left an extended window (28 d in Italy and 32 d in NYC) for largely uninterrupted airborne transmission to spread the disease. The simultaneous implementation of face covering and social distancing, such as that undertaken in China, was most optimal, and this configuration, in conjunction with extensive testing and contact tracing, was responsible for the curve flattening in China

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !p self assert = Also, there likely existed remnants of virus transmission after the implementation of regulatory measures, because of circumstances when the measures were not practical or were disobeyed and/or imperfection of the measures.

  # / June, 2020 - PNAS
  # let !q self assert = However, it is implausible that the limitations of mitigation measures alone contributed dominantly to the global pandemic trend, as exemplified by the success in China. Our work suggests that the failure in containing the propagation of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide is largely attributed to the unrecognized importance of airborne virus transmission.

  / June, 2020 - PNAS
  let !r self assert = It is also important to emphasize that sound science should be effectively communicated to policy makers and should constitute the prime foundation in decision-making amid this pandemic. Implementing policies without a scientific basis could lead to catastrophic consequences, particularly in light of attempts to reopen the economy in many countries. Clearly, integration between science and policy is crucial to formulation of effective emergency responses by policy makers and preparedness by the public for the current and future public health pandemics.

  head = This study examined the effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Both simulated sunlight and matrix significantly affected the decay rate of the virus. Relative humidity alone did not affect the decay rate; however, minor interactions between relative humidity and the other factors were observed. These results suggest that the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on environmental conditions, particularly sunlight.

  >>> Abstract
    Aerosols represent a potential route of transmission of COVID-19. This study examined the effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Both simulated sunlight and matrix significantly affected the decay rate of the virus. Relative humidity alone did not affect the decay rate; however, minor interactions between relative humidity and the other factors were observed. Decay rates in simulated saliva, under simulated sunlight levels representative of late winter/early fall and summer were 0.121±0.017 min-1 (90% loss: 19 minutes) and 0.379±0.072 min-1 (90% loss: 6 minutes), respectively. The mean decay rate without simulated sunlight across all relative humidity levels was 0.008±0.011 min-1 (90% loss: 125 minutes). These results suggest that the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on environmental conditions, particularly sunlight. These data may be useful to inform mitigation strategies to minimize the potential for aerosol transmission.

  # let !c self assert = Average decay constants for infectivity ranged from near zero for tests without simulated sunlight to 0.48 min-1, or 38%/min, for tests with high-intensity simulated sunlight at 70% relative humidity. Stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that kInfectivity was dependent on the simulated sunlight intensity and the suspension matrix (P<0.0001 and P=.0004, respectively), but not relative humidity (P=0.0946). Interactions between suspension matrix and simulated sunlight intensity (P<0.0001), suspension matrix and relative humidity (P=0.0017), and simulated sunlight intensity and relative humidity (P=0.0463), were also significant. While the effect of suspension matrix was statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of simulated sunlight was much greater, as suggested by a greater standardized regression coefficient (-0.117 for simulated sunlight vs. 0.022 for matrix). The overall adjusted r2 for the model was 0.88.

  # / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  # let !d self assert = The present study examined the influence of simulated sunlight and relative humidity on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols generated from virus suspended in either simulated saliva or culture medium at 20°C. Simulated sunlight rapidly inactivated the virus in aerosols in either suspension matrix, with half-lives of less than 6 minutes and 90% of the virus inactivated in less than 20 minutes for all simulated sunlight levels tested.

  / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  let !e self assert = There was a small but statistically significant reduction in decay rate under high-intensity sunlight when the virus was suspended in culture medium compared to simulated saliva, suggesting that the matrix in which the virus is suspended may also be an important factor to consider when examining the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in an aerosol.

  # / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  # let !f self assert = It should be noted that many additional factors beyond the relative stability of the virus in an aerosol contribute to the potential for aerosol transmission of disease. These include the amount of virus present in an aerosol, the size and infectious dose of aerosol particles, the distance and airflow dynamics between infected and uninfected individuals, the presence of mitigation measures such as personal protective equipment.

  # / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  # let !g self assert = Relative humidity alone did not significantly affect decay of the virus, although there were interactions identified between relative humidity and the other factors. However, the magnitude of these interactions was minor compared to the magnitude of the effect of simulated sunlight. The half-lives estimated from the mean decay constants across all relative humidity levels without simulated sunlight present were 55 and 86 minutes for aerosols generated from virus suspended inculture medium and simulated saliva, respectively.

  # / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  # let !h self assert = The half-life from the present study for culture medium is similar to the value of 1.1 hours reported recently for SARS-CoV-2 in darkness and 65% relative humidity. The prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 under conditions representative of indoor environments highlights the need for additional studies to better understand the potential sources of aerosols and viral load present in these settings.

  # / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  # let !i self assert = It has been previously reported that other coronaviruses were significantly less stable at higher relative humidities, with the half-life for human coronavirus 229E decreasing from 67.3 ± 8.2 hours to 3.3 ± 0.2 hours for relative humidity levels of 50 and 80%, respectively. While a similar effect was not observed for SARS-CoV-2 in the present study, it is possible that the shorter test durations used in the present study precluded detection of this effect of relative humidity. It is possible that additional tests of longer duration without simulated sunlight would allow a better assessment of the effect of relative humidity on SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, but the results of the present study suggest that any such effect would be relatively minor in comparison to the effect of sunlight.

  # / June, 2020 - The Journal of Infectious Diseases
  # let !j self assert = It was necessary to concentrate the viral stock used in the present study to ensure that quantifiable concentrations of virus were present in aerosols. However, the addition of the concentrated viral stock to the simulated saliva significantly altered the properties of the simulated saliva, specifically the fractional solids and protein content. Thus, while a small difference in decay was observed between the simulated saliva and culture medium in the presence of simulated sunlight, it is possible that the viral suspension diluted in simulated saliva is not representative of the composition of expelled particles in infected individuals.

  // Lifting the Lid on Toilet Plume Aerosol: A Literature Review With Suggestions for Future Research
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2012.04.330
  ref 'Johnson_et_al_10_08_2012
  head = Contaminated toilets have been clearly shown to produce large droplet and droplet nuclei bioaerosols during flushing, and research suggests that this toilet plume could play an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases for which the pathogen is shed in feces or vomit. The possible role of toilet plume in airborne transmission of norovirus, SARS, and pandemic influenza is of particular interest.

  >>> Background
    The potential risks associated with “toilet plume” aerosols produced by flush toilets is a subject of continuing study. This review examines the evidence regarding toilet plume bioaerosol generation and infectious disease transmission.

  >>> Methods
    The peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched to identify articles related to aerosol production during toilet flushing, as well as epidemiologic studies examining the potential role of toilets in infectious disease outbreaks.

  >>> Results
    The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.

  >>> Conclusion
    Research suggests that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities.

  # transmission via toilet flushing of aerosols
  // Viral Contamination of Aerosol and Surfaces Through Toilet Use in Health Care and Other Settings
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2014.03.026
  ref 'xyz_et_al_05_09_2014
  head = Our study confirms that toilets are an important source of viral contamination. A very important source of contamination from toilets seems to be droplets coming from toilet flush and settling on surfaces, as demonstrated by the high correspondence between the HAdV strains found in water and on surfaces. Another important mechanism of diffusion is hands, which cause the high amount of contamination observed for door handles and flushing buttons, confirming the importance of handwashing and disinfection for infection control.

  >>> Background
    The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations.

  >>> Methods
    To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used.

  >>> Results
    On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination.

  >>> Conclusions
    The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread.

Surprisingly, the frequency of HAdV positivity increased on surfaces after cleaning, although not significantly.

In the hospital, the corresponding titers were 5.8 × 106 ± 5,712 GC/m3, 483 ± 53 GC/cm2, and 6.6 × 107 ± 668 GC/mL, all significantly (P < .01) higher than in offices. Such values were not related to the corresponding TVBC values in offices (147 ± 251 CFU/m3 in air and 1.44 ± 5 CFU/cm2 on surfaces) or in the hospital (293 ± 209 CFU/m3 in air and 1 ± 5 CFU/cm2 on surfaces).

  # let !k self assert = Viral presence was confirmed by sequencing the amplified nucleic acids, which also allowed identification of detected viruses. In offices where only HAdVs were detected, 18 different strains were found, belonging to 12 genotypes. Genotype 5 was found most often (detected in 17 samples), followed by the genotype 1 (detected in 7 samples). Eight strains were simultaneously detected in separate samples collected from the same toilet on the same sampling date; the frequency of this correspondence (number of sampling days with correspondence/total number of sampling days) between air and surfaces was 25% and between water and surfaces was 50%.

Sixteen strains of HAdV and 1 strain of TTV were simultaneously detected in separate samples collected from the same toilet on the same sampling date. The frequency of correspondence (as previously defined) was 77% between water and surfaces, 44% between water and air, and 22% among the 3 matrices.

  # let !m self assert = The other viruses we investigated were almost absent: only 1 sample was found to be positive for NoV GII and no NoV GI, EV, RV, or HRV were detected. A possible explanation of this observation can be the different epidemiologic diffusion of these agents.

  / May, 2020 - Am J Infect Control.
  let !n self assert = In some studies the PCR positivity of surface and air samples has been confirmed by cell culture but, here, none of the HAdV PCR-positive samples were confirmed as infective.

  # / May, 2020 - Am J Infect Control.
  # let !o self assert = When comparing the results of the virologic analysis of surfaces before and after disinfection, the HAdV positivity and titers seem to increase even if not significantly, whereas the values of TVBC decrease, mainly in the hospital. The reason for this contradiction seems to be the interference of dirtiness on PCR enzymes, as demonstrated by our experiments on artificially contaminated surfaces, as well as previous studies. We can conclude that molecular data on surfaces before disinfection are affected by underestimation due to interference by organic substances on PCR and data obtained after disinfection are affected by overestimation due to the detection of noninfective DNA. Thus, the validity of TVBC abatement for predicting virus removal should be assessed through further investigation.

  head = In this investigation, we were able to show when simulating loose stool that material deposited both on the sidewalls and in the bowl water were involved in the dissemination of micro‐organisms into the air and onto surrounding surfaces. Sequential flushing resulted in further distribution of micro‐organisms into the air although the numbers declined after each flush. Serratia adhering to the sidewalls, as well as free‐floating organisms in the toilet water, were responsible for the formation of bacterial aerosols.

  >>> Aims
    To determine the level of aerosol formation and fallout within a toilet cubicle after flushing a toilet contaminated with indicator organisms at levels required to mimic pathogen shedding during infectious diarrhoea.

  >>> Methods and Results
    A semisolid agar carrier containing either Serratia marcesens or MS2 bacteriophage was used to contaminate the sidewalls and bowl water of a domestic toilet to mimic the effects of soiling after an episode of acute diarrhoea. Viable counts were used to compare the numbers of Serratia adhering to the porcelain surfaces and those present in the bowl water before and after flushing the toilet. Air sampling and settle plates were used to determine the presence of bacteria or virus‐laden aerosols within the toilet cubicle. After seeding there was a high level of contamination on the porcelain surfaces both under the rim and on the sides of the bowl. After a single flush there was a reduction of 2·0–3·0 log cycles cm−2 for surface attached organisms. The number of micro‐organisms in the bowl water was reduced by 2·0–3·0 log cycles ml−1 after the first flush and following a second flush, a further reduction of c. 2·0 log cycles ml−1 was achieved. Micro‐organisms in the air were at the highest level immediately after the first flush (mean values, 1370 CFU m−3 for Serratia and 2420 PFU m−3 for MS2 page). Sequential flushing resulted in further distribution of micro‐organisms into the air although the numbers declined after each flush. Serratia adhering to the sidewalls, as well as free‐floating organisms in the toilet water, were responsible for the formation of bacterial aerosols.

  >>> Conclusion
    Although a single flush reduced the level of micro‐organisms in the toilet bowl water when contaminated at concentrations reflecting pathogen shedding, large numbers of micro‐organisms persisted on the toilet bowl surface and in the bowl water which were disseminated into the air by further flushes.

Darlow and Bale (1959) estimated that c. 80% of air‐borne particles released after flushing a toilet seeded with a liquid culture containing Serratia were probably <4 μ m.

Although flushing reduced the initial level of colonization by about 2 log cycles, c. 103 CFU cm−2 persisted on the surfaces despite repeated flushing. When the bowl water was disinfected and neutralized prior to flushing it did not alter the level of bacteria attached to the sidewalls.

Air‐borne contamination could help to explain the high level of secondary spread of norovirus, within closed communities.

  // Potential for Aerosolization of Clostridium Difficile After Flushing Toilets: The Role of Toilet Lids in Reducing Environmental Contamination Risk
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2011.08.010
  ref 'Best_et_al_12_05_2011
  head = Our data suggest that lidless conventional toilets increase the risk of Clostridium difficile aerosolization and surrounding environmental contamination and thus transmission of bacteria. Our results also demonstrate that if lids are fitted to current models they will very likely become contaminated upon flushing. It also highlights the imperative for hand washing after toilet use, and frequent cleaning to remove contamination.

  >>> Background
    Toilet facilities in healthcare settings vary widely, but patient toilets are commonly shared and do not have lids. When a toilet is flushed without the lid closed, aerosol production may lead to surface contamination within the toilet environment.

  >>> Aim
    To substantiate the risks of airborne dissemination of C. difficile following flushing a toilet, in particular when lids are not fitted.

  >>> Methods
    We performed in-situ testing, using faecal suspensions of C. difficile to simulate the bacterial burden found during disease, to measure C. difficile aerosolization. We also measured the extent of splashing occurring during flushing of two different toilet types commonly used in hospitals.

  >>> Findings
    C. difficile was recoverable from air sampled at heights up to 25 cm above the toilet seat. The highest numbers of C. difficile were recovered from air sampled immediately following flushing, and then declined 8-fold after 60 min and a further 3-fold after 90 min. Surface contamination with C. difficile occurred within 90 min after flushing, demonstrating that relatively large droplets are released which then contaminate the immediate environment. The mean numbers of droplets emitted upon flushing by the lidless toilets in clinical areas were 15–47, depending on design. C. difficile aerosolization and surrounding environmental contamination occur when a lidless toilet is flushed.

  >>> Conclusion
    Lidless conventional toilets increase the risk of C. difficile environmental contamination, and we suggest that their use is discouraged, particularly in settings where CDI is common.

  head = Flushing was activated by a flushometer operated at two pressure levels, 400 kP a (high pressure [HP ]) and 200 kP a (low pressure [LP ]), and by a water cistern tank placed 95 cm (high tank [HT ]) and 46 cm (low tank [LT ]) above the toilet seat. The emission strength in the HP condition was statistically greater than that in the LP condition, whereas the cistern tank system produced less emissions than the flushometer system, and tank height was not found to be a sensitive parameter. Finally, our findings also imply that a cistern tank design is preferable to a flushometer design with respect to aerosol generation.

  >>> Abstract
    The flushing of toilets generates contaminated aerosols, the transmission of which may cause the spread of disease, particularly in the immunocompromised or the elderly. This study investigated the emission strength of three types of airborne bacteria, namely Staphylococcus epidermidis , Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas alcaligenes , during toilet flushing in a custom‐built toilet under a controlled environment. Flushing was activated by a flushometer operated at two pressure levels, 400 kP a (high pressure [HP ]) and 200 kP a (low pressure [LP ]), and by a water cistern tank placed 95 cm (high tank [HT ]) and 46 cm (low tank [LT ]) above the toilet seat. The pathogens emitted by the first flush were calculated, with the correlations between airborne pathogen emissions and droplet concentration (HP , r =0.944, P <.001; LP , r =0.803, P <.001, HT , r =0.885, P <.05) and bacterial size (HP , r =−0.919, P <.001; LP , r =−0.936, P <.001; HT , r =−0.967, P <.05) in the different conditions then tested. The emission strength in the HP condition was statistically greater than that in the LP condition, whereas the cistern tank system produced less emissions than the flushometer system, and tank height was not found to be a sensitive parameter.

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !c self assert = Two salient points can be observed. First, the flushometer system produced a significantly higher droplet concentration than the tank system regardless of the water pressure or tank height. Second, emission was detected immediately after flushing was activated, and it took less than 15 seconds for the droplet concentration to increase to peak level.

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !d self assert = The water pressure for the cistern tank was 4.9 and 9.8 kPa for the LT and HT conditions, respectively, whereas that for the flushometer was 200 and 400 kPa. Hence, the pressure produced by the cistern tank was, at most, 5% (9.8/200) of that produced by the flushometer, which suggests that cistern systems create much less energy for the atomization of droplets, and thus generate significantly fewer droplets.

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !e self assert = It can be seen that the total emission strength in the HP condition was approximately 3.6, 21.0, and 19.8 times greater than that in the LP, HT, and LT conditions, respectively. These results are comparable to those published by Johnston et al.,14 who found the highest number of droplets, that is, 145 000, to be yielded by a flushometer operating at >350 kPa among the four flushing mechanisms they tested. However, that droplet number is only approximately half that found in the present study. The discrepancy may be attributable to their neglect of droplet loss inside the bowl. Their working pressure was also less than 400 kPa, and the different particle counters used in the two studies may also have affected the concentration results. Nonetheless, the two measurements are in fairly good agreement.

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !f self assert = Size‐resolved aerosol concentrations: The ratio of the average droplet emission strength was calculated. The HP to LP ratios for 0.3‐0.6 μm, 0.6‐10 μm, 1.5‐10 μm, and 2‐10 μm were 3.9, 2.3, 1.3, and 1.6, respectively, which are in line with the ratio of 3.6 for the total concentration. The magnitude of the ratios for the cistern tanks was very different. For droplet diameters in the range of 0.3‐0.6 μm, the HP/HT droplet emission ratio was 29.2 times, whereas that for those ranging from 0.6 to 10 μm, 1.5 to 10 μm, and 2 to 10 μm were 7.8, 10.2, and 6.8, respectively. Hence, compared with the flushometer, the droplet emission concentration produced by the cistern tank was only 3.4% for droplets sized ≤0.6 μm, whereas it ranged from 10% to 14% for droplets ≥1.5 μm. This finding has important implications, showing that an exposure risk still exists even for tank flushing (with a low degree of atomization energy) with a low level of total droplet emissions.

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !g self assert = Pathogen emission strength of first flush: The emission strength of S. epidermidis was statistically greater than that of E. coli and P. alcaligenes in the HP (P <.05) and LP (P <.05) conditions, respectively. For all three bacteria, the emission strength under HP was statistically greater than that under LP: S. epidermidis (P <.001), E. coli (P <.05), and P. alcaligenes (P <.001). The strengths recorded under HP were almost double those recorded under LP. For E. coli tested in the HT and LT scenarios, the respective CFU results were very low. As similarly low or even lower CFU results were anticipated for P. alcaligenes , only the HP and LP scenarios were tested.
  #
  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !h self assert = It can be seen that there was a positive correlation between the droplet and pathogen concentrations in the HP, LP, and HT conditions, whereas a non‐intuitive result was obtained for LT, that is, the emission strength was higher than in the HT condition. The exact reason for this result is unclear, but may be attributable to the very low concentration of aerosols in the HT and LT conditions. The explanation is further clouded by the highly complex water flow (atomization process).

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !i self assert = It can be inferred from these results that low flushing pressure is better in practice than high pressure. However, additional factors such as refilling time and cleaning performance also need to be considered, and hence, the best level of in‐use flushing pressure for minimizing the generation of emissions cannot be determined solely on the basis of these results. In practice, an overly low pressure may be insufficient to remove the waste adhering to the bowl surface, which raises issues of hygiene.

  # / July, 2017 - Indoor Air
  # let !j self assert = This paper also highlights the need for greater concern over the transmission via toilet flushing of aerosols containing pathogenic organisms, which poses particular for the immunocompromised, children and the elderly.

    Viral infections during pregnancy can have devastating consequences on pregnancy outcomes, fetal development, and maternal health. In this review, we examine fetal and maternal immune defense mechanisms that mediate resistance against viral infections and discuss the range of syndromes that ensue when such mechanisms fail, from fetal developmental defects to establishment of chronic infection. Further, we highlight the role of maternal immune activation, or uncontrolled inflammation triggered by viral infections during pregnancy, and its potential downstream pathological effects, including tissue damage and fetal demise. Insights into the respective contributions of direct viral toxicity versus fetal and maternal immune responses that underlie the pathogenesis of congenital disease will guide future treatment strategies.

  head = Our study found robust negative associations between temperature as well as humidity and COVID-19 transmission before the large-scale public-health interventions in China and the U.S. Moreover, the temperature has a consistent influence on the R values, for both Chinese cities and U.S. counties; relative humidity also has consistent effects across the two countries. Our study concludes that after the lockdowns in China and the U.S., temperature and relative humidity still play an important role in reducing the R values but to a less extent.

  >>> Abstract
    With the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, a question is whether the coming summer in the northern hemisphere will reduce the transmission intensity of COVID-19 with increased humidity and temperature. In this paper, we investigate this problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates from January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities, and cases with confirmed dates from March 15 to April 25 for 1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical analysis is performed to assess the relationship between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for various demographic, socio-economic, geographic, healthcare and policy factors and correcting for cross-sectional correlation. We find a similar influence of the temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values) of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries: one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023 (0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.). If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the northern hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by temperature and 0.20 by humidity). Moreover, after the lockdowns in China and the U.S., temperature and relative humidity still play an important role in reducing the R values but to a less extent. Given the notion that the non-intervened R values are around 2.5 to 3, only weather factors cannot make the R values below their critical condition of R<1, under which the epidemic diminishes gradually. Therefore, public health intervention such as social distancing is crucial to block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer.

  let !a self assert = Our study suggests that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can potentially reduce the transmissibility of the COVID-19, but it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemic will “automatically” diminish when summer comes, because temperature and humidity alone are not sufficient to make the R value less than the critical value of 1 based on their effect estimates.

  # / March, 2020 - SSRN
  # let !b self assert = We find a similar influence of the temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values) of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries: one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023 (0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.).

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !c self assert = If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the northern hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by temperature and 0.20 by humidity).

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !d self assert = If all other conditions are held fixed, it is impossible to lower down the R value to 1 by just temperature and relative humidity, based on the fact that the initial R0 value is about 2.5 to 3. Therefore, public health intervention is still necessary to block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer. Particularly, lockdowns, constraints on human mobility, increase in hospital beds, etc. can effectively reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19.

  # / March, 2020 - SSRN
  # let !e self assert = After lockdown, the temperature and relative humidity also present negative relationships with R values for both countries. For China, its statistically significant (with p values lower than 0.05), and one-degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity reduce R values by 0.0209 (95% CI [-0.0378, -0.0041]) and 0.0054 (95% CI [-0.0104, -0.0004]), respectively. For the U.S. the estimated effects of the temperature and relative humidity on R values are still negative but no longer statistically significant (with p values 0.141 and 0.073, respectively).

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !e self assert = In China, before the lockdowns, in cities with higher levels of population density, the virus spreads faster than that in less crowded cities due to more possible contacts among people. One thousand people per square kilometer rise in population density is associated with a 0.1188 (95% CI [0.0573, 0.1803]) increase in the R value before lockdown.

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !f self assert = Cities in China with more doctors have a smaller transmission intensity, since the infected are treated in hospitals and hence unable to transmit to others. Particularly, one thousand more doctors are associated with a 0.0058 [-0.0090, -0.0025] decrease in the R value during the overall time period; the influence of doctor number is greater before lockdown with a coefficient of 0.0109 (95% CI [-0.0163, -0.0056]).

  let !g self assert = In the U.S., theres a strong relationship between R value and the number of ICU beds per capita after lockdown, with a p value at 0.001; every unit increase in ICU bed per 10,000 population decreases the R value by 0.0110 (95% CI [-0.0171, -0.0049]).

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !h self assert = Counties in U.S. with more people over 65 years old have lower R values, but the magnitude is small, i.e. one percent increase in fraction of aged over 65 is associated with a 0.0092 decrease in R value in the overall time period.

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !i self assert = For the U.S. counties, relative humidity and absolute humidity are almost equivalent in explaining the variation of the R value (12.57% vs. 12.55%), while absolute humidity does achieve a higher significance level (p-value of 0.00001) compared to relative humidity (p-value of 0.019) before lockdown. However, the coefficient of absolute humidity is not statistically significant for Chinese cities (p-value of 0.312).

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !j self assert = In China, the health emergency policies on January 24, 2020 lowered the average R value from 2.1174 to 0.8084, which corresponds to a more than 60% drop. In the U.S., the regression results of the data as of April 25 show that although the R value has not decreased to less than 1, the lockdown policies have reduced the average R value by nearly half, from 2.1970 to 1.1837.

  # / March, 2020 - SSRN
  # let !k self assert = Regression results show that before the lockdown, 1% decrease of BMI drop is associated with a decrease of R value by 0.004093. After the lockdown, the BMI drop does not significantly affect R value.

  / March, 2020 - SSRN
  let !l self assert = For the U.S., we use the M50 index, the fraction of daily median of maximum moving distance over that in the normal time (workdays between February 17 and March 7), as the proxy of mobility. It has a positive relationship with R value for both overall and after lockdown time period with p-values lower than 0.01, which demonstrates that counties with more social movements would have higher R values than others.

  >>> Abstract
    Environmental factors, including seasonal climatic variability, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks, but relationships between Covid-19 dynamics and climate remain controversial. We assessed the impact of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of Covid-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-March 2020. Here we show that Covid-19 growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 C, and specific humidity of 4-6 g/m3 during the outbreak period, while they were lower both in warmer/wetter and colder/dryer regions. Relationships between Covid-19 and climate were robust to the potential confounding effects of air pollution and socio-economic variables, including population size, density and health expenditure. The strong relationship between local climate and Covid-19 growth rates suggests the possibility of seasonal variation in the spatial pattern of outbreaks, with temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere becoming at particular risk of severe outbreaks during the austral autumn-winter.

The observed daily growth rate during the exponential phase was on average 0.28 (SD = 0.13), and ranged from 0.06 (West Bank and Gaza, Singapore) to 0.72 (Denmark). The highest growth rates were observed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, although fast growth also occurred in some warm climates, notably in Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines, suggesting that no area of the world is exempt from SARS-Cov-2 infection risk.

  # / April, 2020 - MedRxiv
  # let !d self assert = Covid-19 growth rate was strongly related to a combination of climatic and socioeconomic variables. Furthermore, growth rate was faster in regions with large human population size (F1,74 = 27.5, P < 0.001) and high health expenditure (F1,52 = 8.9, P = 0.004).

  # let !g self assert = The decrease of Covid-19 growth rate in warm and humid climates can be explained by two non-exclusive processes. First, coronavirus persistence outside the organisms decreases at high temperature, medium-high humidity, and under sunlight, even though they can survive several hours at temperatures >30° C 5,24, implying that high ambient temperatures are not enough to quickly inactivate the infection. Second, host susceptibility can be higher in cold and dry environments, for instance because of a slower mucociliary clearance, or a decreased host immune function under harsher conditions.

However, the association between COVID-19 and average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) across the provinces was not consistent. There were spatial and temporal heterogeneities in COVID-19 occurrence, which could be attributed to meteorological factors (daily AT and ARH) as well as interventions measures across provinces.

  >>> Abstract
    COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 if of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily count of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei. Every 1°C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04°C to 8.2°C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.

The between-region variability of meteorological factors is likely the main reason for the heterogeneity of effects. Small sample size in some provinces leads to model instability and invalid estimates. Most of the daily count of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei included in our models (68.6%)[26] were identified as imported cases from Hubei province or cases having a close contact with imported cases for the study period. Meteorological factors mainly affect COVID-19 transmission by affecting the survival of the coronavirus in the environment, and we assume that the coronavirus was unlikely to exist in the environment in other provinces, where most cases were imported during the study period. The intervention measures are expected to also have an important impact on the associations between meteorological factors and the transmission of the virus.

  >>> Abstract
    The outbreak of COVID-19 started in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world. In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFluTM database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau (τ) using the formula t=τ/2u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019. Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.

  # let !a self assert = Genome size of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 29 782 bp to 29 903 bp. The aligned matrix was 29 910 bp in length, including 140 variable sites. The CDS regions contained 120 substitution sites, which were classified as 58 haplotypes. Nucleotide diversity (Pi) was 0.15×10−3±0.02×10−3 (standard deviation, SD, hereafter). Haplotype diversity (Hd) was 0.953±0.016 (SD) and variance of Hd was 0.26×10−3.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !b self assert = A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous (65.83%) and 40 synonymous (33.61%) substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions (50.63%) changed the biochemical properties of the amino acid (AA), and are therefore potentially associated with virus adaptation.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !c self assert = The current samplings showed that the H1 haplotype has been found in 19 patients, but most haplotypes were just sequenced once, suggesting that the haplotype H1 was rapidly circulated at an early stage of human-to-human transmissions.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !d self assert = In comparisons with published genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 are still low, without evident recombination sites/regions (Rm=2, P=1.0) at this time.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !e self assert = Estimation of the substitution rates using 90 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the rate for SARS-CoV-2 was close to or lower than the rates for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Due to the mild symptoms and low mortality, the immune systems of the infected humans may provide a suitable environment for propagation of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is able to infect humans not only through the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but also use the mucous membranes in the eyes which may boost regional circulation and large-scale spread.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !f self assert = Of the 93 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, 39 (41.93%) were from infected patients in 11 countries outside China and encoded 31 haplotypes (Hd=0.987±0.009 (SD), Pi=0.16×10–3±0.01×10–3), with 27 nationally/regionally private haplotypes. The 54 genomes (58.07%) from China also encoded 31 haplotypes (Hd=0.906±0.001 (SD), Pi=0.14×10–3±0.03×10–3).

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !g self assert = A proportion Z-test showed significant differences in haplotype diversity of samples between China and other countries (χ2=4.024, df=1, P<0.05). The high haplotype diversity found in samples from other countries may be because the sampling dates were mostly after 22 January 2020, while those in China were before this date. In addition, the low level of radiation exposure on long-distance international flights may have accelerated mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !h self assert = The population size of SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly increasing. The population of SARS-CoV-2 underwent sudden expansion (τ=2.887, Sum of Squared deviation, SSD=0.541×10–3, P=0.88, Harpendings Raggedness index, R=0.010, P=0.88). The calculated expansion was 28.72 days (95% Confident Interval: 12.29–54.36 days) ago.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !i self assert = Of the 93 genomes, the latest one was sampled on 03 February 2020, so the estimated expansion date was on 06 January 2020 (95% CI: 11 December 2019–22 January 2020), which may be related to the New Year holiday.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !j self assert = Before 06 January 2020, 129 patients were identified as SARS-CoV-2 infected through field investigations. Of 22 genomes (17.05% of 129 patients) sequenced before 06 January 2020 in Wuhan, China, 13 haplotypes (22.41% of 58 haplotypes) were recovered, which were H1 and its derived descendant haplotypes, and H3.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !k self assert = Mismatch distribution analysis of the 22 genomes before 06 January 2020 also showed a sudden population expansion of SARS-CoV-2. This earlier population expansion time was estimated at 28.38 days before 05 January 2020, which was the latest sampling date of the 22 genomes. This earlier expansion date was thus estimated to have occurred on 08 December 2019, when there was only one infected patient officially reported. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might have already circulated widely among humans in Wuhan before December 2019, probably beginning in mid to late November.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !l self assert = Evolutionary relationships of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes: Phylogenetic networks showed that the 58 haplotypes were clustered into two main clades. Clade I included 19 haplotypes and Clade II included 39 haplotypes. The outgroup bat-RaTG13-CoV was connected to Clade I, supposed to be an ancestral clade for Clade II. The long branches of H15 and H17 correspond to an excessive amount of mutations, which are possibly affected by sequencing errors, but this is still to be determined.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !m self assert = Three different datasets were used to infer evolutionary networks, which consistently supported H13 and H38 as the potentially ancestral haplotypes, i.e., the outgroup bat-RaTG13-CoV could connect to both H13 and H38, or H38 alone, or through a medium vector mv1 (an intermediate host or the first infected humans) connected to both H13 and H38 by single mutations at positions 18067 (S, synonymous substitution) and/or 29102 (S), referring to the numbering of the alignment length 29 910 bp.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !k self assert = The H1, H3, and H13 were three core haplotypes, so that Groups A–C were recognized using them as the central (i.e., ancestral super-spreader) haplotypes. Groups D and E were recognized based on two new super-spreader haplotypes, H56 and a medium vector mv2, which was a hypothesized (often ancestral) haplotype not sampled in the current samples. These two groups can be also treated as subgroups of Group C.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !k self assert = Moreover, the SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test further enhanced the phylogenetic relationship retrieved from 58 haplotypes, that either H13 or H38 (with H45) appeared in the basal lineages, although it was difficult to distinguish which one, H13 or H38, originated earlier.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !n self assert = In the network, four satellite haplotypes and H35 connected to H13 (Group A), and nine satellite haplotypes and H38+H45 and H50 connected to H3 (Group B). The connections between the H3 and H1 are two mutations at positions 8789 (S) and 28151 (NS, non-synonymous substitution), the latter mutation changed both residues and the biochemical properties of the AA. This biochemical change may be associated with the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !m self assert = The H1 haplotype, the most abundant, included 19 samples, while 26 satellite haplotypes and H40+(H43 and H47) haplotypes are directly derived from H1 (Group C). Moreover, five haplotypes of Group D and four haplotypes of Group E were also derived from H1.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !o self assert = Phylogenetic networks showed that bat-RaTG13-CoV was nested with Group B in Clade I, and Clade II tends to be derived from Clade I, i.e., H1 and its descendant haplotypes were new mutants from an ancestral haplotype in Clade I. The rooted network suggested two potential evolutionary paths of available haplotypes that can be from H13 through H3 to H1 and H38, or from H38 through H3 to H1 and H13. Both scenarios suggested that H3 might be the ancestral haplotype of H1.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !p self assert = H13 was only recovered from five Shenzhen (Guangdong Province) samples, including patient 2 of the familial cluster. Two derived haplotypes were also only found in Shenzhen of Guangdong Province (H14 from the grandson of patient 2), and the other three haplotypes were found in three samples from Japan and one sample from Arizona in the United States.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !q self assert = According to an epidemiological study, the Shenzhen family could have been infected during their visit to Wuhan. This suggests that H13 might have originated from Wuhan. Genetically, haplotypes of Group A have links to only Wuhan haplotype H3 (only EPI_ISL_406801). It is possible that H13 was newly derived from H3 and did not spread in Wuhan, or that three repatriated Japanese might be infected by an unknown source of H13 in Wuhan, China or somewhere else, or that no samples have been sequenced yet.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !r self assert = H38 has three genomes from the same patient, who was the first identified infected patient in the United States. This patient might have been infected while visiting his family in Wuhan, China, or was infected in some other place. The original source of H38 can be explained as that of H13, which can be also derived from H3, and the derived H45 was from a Chongqing patient who was reported as working in Wuhan and had no link to the Huanan Market.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !s self assert = The H3 haplotype has only one sample from Wuhan, which was not linked to the Huanan Market, and the other samples in this group were from outside of Wuhan. Noteworthily, all the samples from the Market belonged to H1 or its derived haplotypes (H2, H8-H12) indicating that there were circulated infections within the market in the short term.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !t self assert = In this study, evolutionary relationships indicated that H1 and its descendant haplotypes from the Market should be derived from H3. H3 mutated to the H1 by two substitutions, and none of the currently available Market samples encoded H3, suggesting that H3 might have originated and spread outside of the Market before an early stage of population expansion.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !u self assert = The non-synonymous mutation from H3 to H1 might have enhanced the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, and a functional characterization should be performed to confirm this speculation. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 in the Market had been transmitted from other places, or at least, that the Market did not host the original source of SARS-CoV-2. As the first identified infected patients had no link to the Market.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !v self assert = Due to insufficient sampling from Wuhan in the currently available samples, it is not clear whether H3 never appeared in the Market, or H1 was quickly derived from H3 to adapt in the Market.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !w self assert = Of the 54 genomes from patients in China, Chongqing (3 samples), Guangdong (18), Hubei (22), Taiwan (2), and Zhejiang (4) have more than two samples, and the other five provinces have one sample. Hubei (Wuhan) samples dated from 24 December 2019 to 05 January 2020 encoded 13 haplotypes, belonging to Groups C (H1 and 11 satellite haplotypes) and B (only H3). These relationships indicated a rapid transmission and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan at an early stage of human-to-human transmissions.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !x self assert = H1 (no satellite haplotypes) and H3 are the ancestors of haplotypes outside of Wuhan/Hubei because most of early confirmed patients might have history in Wuhan or Hubei. Eighteen Guangdong samples, collected from 10–23 January 2020, encoded 15 haplotypes, belonging to Groups A, C, and E, showing that there were multiple sources imported into Guangdong. Three haplotypes (H14, H15, and H17) may have evolved locally, indicating that human-to-human transmissions happened when SARS-CoV-2 initially spread to Shenzhen in Guangdong Province. Two samples from Taiwan Province, China, encoded H3 and H24 in Groups B and D, respectively, and three samples from Chongqing encoded H1, H40, and H45 in Groups B and C, respectively. There were two sources imported into these two provinces. Four Zhejiang samples encoded H1 and H24 in Group C, which might be only imported from the source of the H1 haplotype.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !y self assert = The samples outside China encoded 31 haplotypes belonging to Groups A–E. Of these, 27 haplotypes are private by regional samplings, only two samples from Thailand were the H1 haplotype, one each from Australia and Belgium were the H3 haplotype, one from the United States was the H19 haplotype, and one from Singapore was the H40 haplotype.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !z self assert = Twelve samples, encoding 10 haplotypes, were from patients in five countries in Asia. Six haplotypes linked to H1, and two each linked to H3 and H1, respectively, indicating the 12 patients were infected by different sources. Human-to-human transmissions may have happened from patients with H53 to H52 haplotypes in Tokyo, Japan. Five Australian samples, encoding six haplotypes in Groups B, C, and D, were from patients of three states. Patients with H3, H25 and H26, and with H55 were in Groups B and C, respectively, and human-to-human transmission might have happened from the patients with H25 to H26, who were in a same tour group in Queensland. The connection between the patients with H56 and H27 is not clear. One possibility is that there was an intermediary spreader with H56, who also transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to other patients in France, the United States, and Taiwan Province of China. 18 European samples, encoding 7 haplotypes, were from patients in 4 countries.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !aa self assert = The patients in England were reported as a household transmission from H28 to H29. The patients in France may have been infected by three different sources, i.e., H44 was linked to H1, H43 might link to H40 (in Chongqing, Singapore or somewhere else), and H30 might link to an intermediary spreader with H56. Of the 13 genomes from the United States, three were from the same patient in Washington encoding the same haplotype H38, while the other ten samples encoded eight haplotypes, covering all five groups, so the sources of infections are complicated. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the United States from these 11 cases. To clarify the exact origins of these haplotypes outside China, we need more epidemiological investigative efforts and more SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from patients at the early stage of transmissions.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !ab self assert = Evolutionary analyses suggested that the source of the H1 haplotype in the Huanan Market was imported from elsewhere, as has been suggested by other researchers.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !ac self assert = The rooted network suggested that H13 and H38 should be ancestral haplotypes that connected to the outgroup bat-RaTG13-CoV through a hypothesized intermediate haplotype. The most common ancestral haplotype was missed because the currently available samples do not include the first identified infected patient and other patients from early December, and because of the relatively high mutation rate of the viral genome. If there are any frozen samples from those patients, it would be worth doing genomic sequencing for phyloepidemiologic study to help to locate the birthplace of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, we expect that the H13 and H38 haplotypes might be found in some samples from infected patients in Wuhan or in other places across the world if more samples are sequenced in future.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !ad self assert = The confirmed patients from the Huanan Market shared the common ancestral haplotype H1, indicating they might be infected from a common source, who may have been a super-spreader in the market. This approach has recovered potentially specific directions of human-to-human transmission in the Shenzhen family (H13 → H14), the Queensland tour group (H25 → H26), the England family (H28 → H29), and the Japanese (H53 → H52). We suspect that there were super-spreaders mediating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of transmissions.

  / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  let !ae self assert = Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 has not had legitimate recombination. Thus, the haplotype-based phyloepidemiologic analyses provide a powerful way to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the very early stage of transmission when reverse mutations and illegitimate recombination are rare. In our analysis, recombination is rejected but the outgroup bat-RaTG13-CoV is relatively highly diverged from SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, which may affect the phyloepidemiologic analyses.

  # / May, 2020 - Zoological Research
  # let !af self assert = Based on the estimated mutation rate of current SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the reverse mutations should be 6×10−3 (0.92×10−3×0.92×10−3 per site per year×29 358 sites×2/12 year), with a neglectable influence on our result. But our observations leave one important question: why are ancestral haplotypes, like H13 and H38, less frequent than H1? It is highly possible that H1 acquired adaptive mutations, such as NS of site 28151, from H3 or H13 (and/or H38), evolved in an independent circulation after they jumped into intermediate hosts or directly transmitted to humans, which should be investigated in future studies if more early genome datasets are available. The exact original sources of H13 and H38 will stay as unsolved mysteries if the early stage samples were not preserved.

  // Estimating the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in Europe
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2405-7
  ref 'Flaxman_et_al_06_08_2020
  head = Given the observed infection fatality ratios and the epidemiology of COVID-19, major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. In all countries in this study we find that these interventions have reduced the reproduction number below one and have contained their epidemics at the current time. When looking at simplistic counterfactuals over the whole epidemic the number of potential deaths averted is substantial.

  >>> Abstract
    Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus1 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number 𝑅𝑡 below 1 (probability 𝑅𝑡< 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.

  let !a self assert = In Italy, our results suggest that, cumulatively, 2.8 million people have been infected as of May 4th, giving an attack rate of 4.6% of the population. In Spain, which has also experienced a large number of deaths we estimate 5.5% of the population have been infected to date. Germany, the most populous country in our study, is estimated to have one of the lowest attack rates at 0.85% with 710,000 people infected. Belgium has the highest estimated attack rates of 8% followed by Spain with 5.5%.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !b self assert = We estimate large reductions in the reproduction number Rt in response to the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results, which are driven more by countries with advanced epidemics and larger numbers of deaths, suggest that these interventions have together had a substantial impact on transmission, as measured by changes in the estimated Rt.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !c self assert = At the time of this study we find current estimates of Rt to range from a posterior mean of 0.44 [0.26 – 0.61] for Norway to a posterior mean of 0.82 [0.73 – 0.93] for Belgium, with an average of 0.66 across the 11 countries, an 82% reduction compared to the pre-intervention values.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !d self assert = For all countries we find the current reproduction number significantly below 1. Overall, we can conclude that current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number Rt below 1 (probability Rt < 1.0 is 99.9% across all countries we consider) and achieve epidemic control. These conclusions are corroborated by individual country studies from a similar period see (France, Spain, Germany and the UK), which arrive at very similar estimates despite different methodologies and data.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !e self assert = Saljie et al 2020 estimate an Rt of 0.67 (we estimate 0.68) for France using hospitalization records, and the Robert Koch Institute for Germany reports Rt of 0.76 (we estimate 0.71) using electronically notified cases. The retrospective stability of our model is variable when the implementations of interventions are very dissimilar; an example of this is seen in Sweden, where interventions were dissimilar to other countries and led to large uncertainty initially.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !f self assert = Our model uncertainty is also dependent on the magnitude of Rt; this occurs because infections are a nonlinear function of Rt and are sensitive to small increases. Uncertainty shrinks greatly when Rt is reduced. Examples of this effect are seen in all countries but is most pronounced in Belgium and France which show large uncertainty in the number of infections in the early epidemic. Our choice of parameterizing Rt using piecewise constant functions means that we cannot capture fine scale variation that could be achieved by using additional covariates.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !g self assert = Lockdown has an identifiable large impact on transmission (81% [75%- 87%] reduction). The close spacing of interventions in time mean the individual effects of the other interventions are not identifiable.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !h self assert = Our partial pooling model requires only one country to provide a signal for the impact of a given intervention, and then this effect is shared across all countries. While this sharing can potentially lead to initial over/under estimation of intervention impact, it also means that a consistent signal for all countries can be estimated before that signal is presented in an individual countries data. Therefore, this sharing is potentially useful for early warning by leveraging what happens in other countries with older data to inform those with newer data.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !i self assert =  We find that, across 11 countries, since the beginning of the epidemic, 3,100,000 [2,800,000- 3,500,000] deaths have been averted due to interventions.

  # / June, 2020 - Nature
  # let !j self assert = The counterfactual model without interventions is illustrative only and reflects our model assumptions. We do not account for changes in behavior; in reality even in the absence of government interventions we would expect Rt to decrease and therefore would overestimate deaths in the no-intervention model. Conversely, we do not consider the impact on the infection fatality rate as a result of an overwhelmed health system in which patients may not be able to access critical care facilities, which would underestimate the number of counterfactual deaths. In the Supplementary Material we show counterfactuals under differing assumptions of the generation distribution and onset-to-death distribution and all scenarios broadly show the same trends. Given this agreement in differing scenarios we believe our estimates for the counterfactual deaths averted to be plausible.

  / June, 2020 - Nature
  let !k self assert = We estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level of under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in hospital settings which misses milder or asymptomatic cases in the community.

  / June, 2020 - Nature
  let !l self assert = We estimate that only a relatively small minority of individuals in each country have been infected. Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not close to herd immunity (~70% if R0 is 3.814). Further, with Rt values below 1 in all countries, the rate of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly.

  head = Our data indicates key differences in the baseline immune capabilities in men and women during the early phase of SARS-COV-2 infection, and suggest a potential immunological underpinning of the distinct mechanisms of disease progression between sexes. These analyses also provide a potential basis for taking sex-dependent approaches to prognosis, prevention, care, and therapy for patient with COVID19.

  >>> Abstract
    A growing body of evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, whether immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 differ between sexes, and whether such differences explain male susceptibility to COVID-19, is currently unknown. In this study, we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients. By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men and women with COVID-19.

  let !a self assert = By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !b self assert = T cell responses were more robustly activated in female patients compared to male patients. In particular, activated CD8 T cells were significantly elevated only in female patients but not in male patients over healthy volunteers.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !c self assert = Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !d self assert = Female patients that develop anti-S IgG during early infection can suppress proinflammatory cytokines such as CXCL10 and do not progress to worse disease.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !e self assert = There was no significant difference in nasal or saliva viral RNA load, although women had lower mean viral load than men.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !f self assert = We found robust increase in ncMono in the male patients compared with female patients, while female patients had elevated intMono.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !g self assert = In contrast to the higher levels of innate cytokines, we found poor T cell activation in males with less induction of CD8 cells expressing CD38 and HLA-DR, two classical T cell activation markers. Studies have shown that this population exhibits high effector functions, such as proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine production, and this subpopulation of activated CD8+ T cells performs an important function during acute viral infections, contributing to viral control.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !h self assert = In our cohort, the male patients who progressed in disease severity had lower levels of CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells at the first collection. In male patients, loss of activated T cells correlated with old age.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !i self assert = We found that activation as well as IFNγ expression of CD8 T cells significantly decline along with age in male patients, while this correlation was not observed in female patients.

  / June, 2020 - medRxiv
  let !j self assert = Collectively, these data suggest that vaccines and therapies to elevate T cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 might be warranted for male patients, while female patients might benefit from therapies that dampen innate immune activation early during disease.

  >>> Abstract
    The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to unprecedented, nearly real-time genetic tracing due to the rapid community sequencing response. Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation and/or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed. We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse.

  // Preliminary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 importation & establishment of UK transmission lineages
  doi: https://doi.org/xyz
  ref 'Pybus_et_al_06_08_2020
  head = The intensive sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveals a high frequency of virus importations that led to onward transmission within the UK. We have detected 1356 transmission lineages in the UK to date. Both the rate and source of virus importations fluctuate rapidly through time. We expect that similar trends in SARS-CoV-2 importation also occurred in other countries and regions that are highly connected by international travel, although these trends may be less apparent if fewer virus genomes are generated from those locations.

  let !a self assert = We detect >1300 independently-introduced transmission lineages. However we expect this number to be an under-estimate. The rate and source of introduction of SARS-CoV-2 lineages into the UK changed substantially and rapidly through time. The rate peaked in mid-March and most introductions occurred during March 2020.

  / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  let !b self assert = Establishment of new transmission lineages rose and fell sharply in March. We estimate that ≈34% of detected UK transmission lineages arrived via inbound travel from Spain, ≈29% from France, ≈14% from Italy, and ≈23% from other countries. The relative contributions of these locations were highly dynamic.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !c self assert = These are statistical estimates based on combining the phylogeny with travel data. Standard phylogeographic analysis was precluded by a lack of virus genetic variation and high variation in genomic sampling among countries.

  / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  let !d self assert = The speed of detection of UK transmission lineages via genome sequencing has increased through time. Many UK transmission lineages now appear to be very rare or extinct, as they have not been detected by genome sequencing for >4 weeks, most likely as a result of the interventions such as social distancing that led to reductions in the numbers of new cases.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !e self assert = The increasing rates and shifting source locations of SARS-CoV-2 importation were not fully captured by early contact tracing.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !f self assert = The TMRCAs of the majority of UK transmission lineages are dated to mid-to-late March (median=25th March, interquartile range = 17th March-1st April). It is important to note that these times represent the date of the first detected transmission event in each lineage, not the virus importation date.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !g self assert = We can use the TMRCA values to estimate the genomic “detection lag” for each UK transmission lineage, which represents the length of time that a transmission lineage went undetected before it was first sampled by genome sequencing. This detection lag has decreased through time as the cumulative number of UK virus genomes generated by the COG-UK project has increased.

  / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  let !h self assert = Our finding shows how the composition of UK transmission lineages has changed through time. In early March the epidemic mostly comprised lineages that had been newly-detected for the first time, whilst by late April most transmission lineages had not been detected by genomic sampling for more than a week.

  / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  let !i self assert = Our finding shows how the number of inbound travellers and global SARS-CoV-2 prevalence changed through time. In early March there was a high volume of arrivals into the UK, however the countries from which most of these arrivals originated had comparatively small numbers of active infections. Towards the end of March the situation was reversed with large epidemics in many countries but a low volume of international arrivals. The mid-March peak in importation occurred because moderate levels of inbound travel coincided with highly active transmission in several European countries.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !j self assert = This estimated importation intensity (EII) to the UK rises rapidly in early March, peaks around 15th March, then quickly declines to a low level in April.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !k self assert = Using a statistical model we estimate the duration of the importation lag to be 10.7 days on average for all transmission lineages. However, the importation lag is expected to be shorter for large transmission lineages because the earliest transmission events within a lineage are much more likely to be observed if the lineage is well sampled.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !l self assert = The estimated lag is 11.9 days for lineages of 2-5 genomes, 9.4 days for lineages of 6-15 genomes and 4.2 days for lineages >15 genomes. The latter value (4.2 days) is our best estimate of the duration between arrival of an inbound infected passenger and the first onward transmission event in the UK, and is similar to the estimated serial interval of SARS-CoV-2.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !m self assert = By combining this statistical lag model with the estimated TMRCAs we estimate that 80% of the importation events that give rise to detectable UK transmission lineages occurred between 28th February and 29th March 2020 (the remaining 20% of imports occurred before or after these dates).

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !n self assert = In early March there was a high volume of arrivals into the UK, however the countries from which most of these arrivals originated had comparatively small numbers of active infections. Towards the end of March the situation was reversed with large epidemics in many countries but a low volume of international arrivals. The mid-March peak in importation occurred because moderate levels of inbound travel coincided with highly active transmission in several European countries.

  # / June, 2020 - Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
  # let !o self assert = In summary, intensive sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveals a high frequency of virus importations that led to onward transmission within the UK. Both the rate and source of virus importations fluctuate rapidly through time. We expect that similar trends in SARS-CoV-2 importation also occurred in other countries and regions that are highly connected by international travel, although these trends may be less apparent if fewer virus genomes are generated from those locations. The relative contributions of SARS-CoV-2 importation and local transmission to early epidemic growth in each country therefore warrants further investigation. These dynamics should be taken into account when planning and modelling future public health actions in the context of international travel.
