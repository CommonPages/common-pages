    head = Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves both cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. T-cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been characterised and correlate well with IgG and IgA antibody titres in COVID-19 patients. It is currently unknown whether antibody responses or T-cell responses in infected people confer protective immunity. The detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 does not indicate directly protective immunity and correlates of protection for COVID-19 have not yet been established.
