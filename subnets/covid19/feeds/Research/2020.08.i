  # Side effects Hydroxychloroquine

    head = We identified 53 eligible studies involving 5496 patients. HCQ is associated with more total AEs (Adverse Effects), gastrointestinal AEs, and skin and subcutaneous tissue AEs compared with placebo or no intervention in the overall population.

    >>> Objectives
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.

    >>> Methods
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the safety of HCQ in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were retrieved starting from the establishment of the database till June 5, 2020. Literature screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk bias were performed independently by two reviewers.

    >>> Results
      We identified 53 eligible studies involving 5496 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that the risk of adverse effects (AEs) in the HCQ group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (RD 0.05, 95%CI, 0.02 to 0.07, P = 0.0002), and the difference was also statistically significant in the COVID-19 subgroup (RD 0.15, 95%CI, 0.07 to 0.23, P = 0.0002) as well as in the subgroup for other diseases (RD 0.03, 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.04, P = 0.003).

    >>> Conclusions
      HCQ is associated with a high total risk of AEs compared with the placebo or no intervention in the overall population. Given the small number of COVID-19 participants included, we should be cautious regarding the conclusion stating that HCQ is linked with an increase incidence of AEs in patients with COVID-19, which we hope to confirm in the future through well-designed and larger sample size studies.

    let !a self assert =  The risks of gastrointestinal AEs, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders AEs, and treatment discontinuation due to AEs in the HCQ group were higher than in the control group. It is worth mentioning that patients treated with HCQ did not have a significantly increased risk of ophthalmic AEs, cardiac AEs, and total SAEs compared to those who were not treated with HCQ.

    let !b self assert = There were two SAEs reported in the HCQ group, one being erythema multiforme and the other one being acute generalized erythematous pustulosis, while none were reported in the control group. Previous studies revealed that skin ADRs generally occurred 5~14 days after the beginning of HCQ therapy, and the rash was characterized as lichen-like, urticaria or simply rash. Additionally, the symptoms were generally mild, which could be relieved after withdrawal of therapy

  // Toilets dominate environmental detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a hospital
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141710
  ref 'Ding_et_al_08_15_2020
    head = 107 surface samples, 46 air samples, two exhaled condensate samples, and two expired air samples were collected within and beyond four three-bed isolation rooms. The fecal-derived aerosols in patients' toilets contained most of the detected SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the importance of surface and hand hygiene for intervention.

    >>> Abstract
      Respiratory and fecal aerosols play confirmed and suspected roles, respectively, in transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An extensive environmental sampling campaign of both toilet and non-toilet environments was performed in a dedicated hospital building for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the associated environmental factors were analyzed. In total, 107 surface samples, 46 air samples, two exhaled condensate samples, and two expired air samples were collected within and beyond four three-bed isolation rooms. The data of the COVID-19 patients were collected. The building environmental design and the cleaning routines were reviewed. Field measurements of airflow and CO2 concentrations were conducted. The 107 surface samples comprised 37 from toilets, 34 from other surfaces in isolation rooms, and 36 from other surfaces outside the isolation rooms in the hospital. Four of these samples were positive, namely two ward door handles, one bathroom toilet seat cover, and one bathroom door handle. Three were weakly positive, namely one bathroom toilet seat, one bathroom washbasin tap lever, and one bathroom ceiling exhaust louver. Of the 46 air samples, one collected from a corridor was weakly positive. The two exhaled condensate samples and the two expired air samples were negative. The fecal-derived aerosols in patients' toilets contained most of the detected SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital, highlighting the importance of surface and hand hygiene for intervention.

  # Hydroxychloroquine
  // A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19
  doi: https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2016638
  article 'Boulware_et_al_08_06_2020
    head = We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection within 4 days after exposure.

    >>> BACKGROUND
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown.

    >>> METHODS
      We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days.

    >>> RESULTS
      We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was −2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, −7.0 to 2.2; P=0.35). Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported.

    >>> CONCLUSIONS
      After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.
