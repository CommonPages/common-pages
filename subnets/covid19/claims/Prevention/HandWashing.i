subject HandWashing
  head = Hand washing with soap and water to remove viruses is a common recommendation for reducing the risk of viral infection grounded in basic physical principles, and backed up by evidence from other viruses. Direct evidence as to the reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection is not yet available, and is uncertain to the extent that the dominant modes of transmission have not yet been established for SARS-CoV-2.

  claim !NonCov2Evidence = Hand washing has been demonstrably effective in reducing the risk of infection for respiratory viruses generally.
