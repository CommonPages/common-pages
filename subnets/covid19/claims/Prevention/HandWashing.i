subject HandWashing
  head = Hand washing with soap and water to remove viruses is a common recommendation for reducing the risk of viral infection. The practice is grounded in basic physical principles, and backed up by evidence from other viruses. Direct evidence of efficacy for COVID-19 is not yet available, and is uncertain to the extent that the dominant modes of transmission have not yet been established.

  claim !NonCov2Evidence = Hand washing has been demonstrably effective in reducing the risk of infection for respiratory viruses generally.
