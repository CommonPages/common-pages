  caption: Total RF (anthropogenic plus natural) for RCPs and extended concentration pathways (ECP)—for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP6, RCP8.5, as well as a supplementary extension RCP6 to 4.5 with an adjustment of emissions after 2100 to reach RCP4.5 concentration levels in 2250 and thereafter. Note that the stated RF levels refer to the illustrative default median estimates only. There is substantial uncertainty in current and future RF levels for any given scenario. Short-term variations in RF are due to both volcanic forcings in the past (1800–2000) and cyclical solar forcing assuming a constant 11-year solar cycle (following the CMIP5 recommendation), except at times of stabilization.

  caption: Historical and projected total anthropogenic RF (W m–2) relative to preindustrial (about 1765) between 1950 and 2100. Previous IPCC assessments (SAR IS92a, TAR/ AR4 SRES A1B, A2 and B1) are compared with representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (see Chapter 12 and Box 1.1 for their extensions until 2300 and Annex II for the values shown here). The total RF of the three families of scenarios, IS92, SRES and RCP, differ for example, for the year 2000, resulting from the knowledge about the emissions assumed having changed since the TAR and AR4.

  caption: Schematic representations of the probability density function of daily temperature, which tends to be approximately Gaussian, and daily precipitation, which has a skewed distribution. Dashed lines represent a previous distribution and solid lines a changed distribution. The probability of occurrence, or frequency, of extremes is denoted by the shaded areas. In the case of temperature, changes in the frequencies of extremes are affected by changes (a) in the mean, (b) in the variance or shape, and (c) in both the mean and the variance. (d) In a skewed distribution such as that of precipitation, a change in the mean of the distribution generally affects its variability or spread, and thus an increase in mean precipitation would also imply an increase in heavy precipitation extremes, and vice-versa. In addition, the shape of the right-hand tail could also change, affecting extremes. Furthermore, climate change may alter the frequency of precipitation and the duration of dry spells between precipitation events.

In each aspect (e.g., the atmosphere, which comprises a wide range of atmospheric processes) the complexity and range of processes has increased over time (illustrated by growing cylinders). Note that during the same time the horizontal and vertical resolution has increased considerably e.g., for spectral models from T21L9 (roughly 500 km horizontal resolution and 9 vertical levels) in the 1970s to T95L95 (roughly 100 km horizontal resolution and 95 vertical levels) at present, and that now ensembles with at least three independent experiments can be considered as standard.

  caption: Estimated changes in the observed global annual mean sea level (GMSL) since 1950 relative to 1961–1990. Estimated changes in global annual sea level anomalies are presented based on tide gauge data (warm mustard: Jevrejeva et al., 2008; dark blue: Church and White, 2011; dark green: Ray and Douglas, 2011) and based on sea surface altimetry (light blue). The altimetry data start in 1993 and are harmonized to start from the mean 1993 value of the tide gauge data. Squares indicate annual mean values and solid lines smoothed values. The shading shows the largest model projected range of global annual sea level rise from 1950 to 2035 for FAR (Figures 9.6 and 9.7 in Warrick and Oerlemans, 1990), SAR (Figure 21 in TS of IPCC, 1996), TAR (Appendix II of IPCC, 2001) and for Church et al. (2011) based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) model results not assessed at the time of AR4 using the SRES B1, A1B and A2 scenarios. Note that in the AR4 no full range was given for the sea level projections for this period. Therefore, the figure shows results that have been published subsequent to the AR4. The bars at the right-hand side of the graph show the full range given for 2035 for each assessment report. For Church et al. (2011) the mean sea level rise is indicated in addition to the full range. See Appendix 1.A for details on the data and calculations used to create this figure.

  caption: Estimated changes in the observed globally and annually averaged surface temperature anomaly relative to 1961–1990 (in °C) since 1950 compared with the range of projections from the previous IPCC assessments. Values are harmonized to start from the same value in 1990. Observed global annual mean surface air temperature anomaly, relative to 1961–1990, is shown as squares and smoothed time series as solid lines (NASA (dark blue), NOAA (warm mustard), and the UK Hadley Centre (bright green) reanalyses). The coloured shading shows the projected range of global annual mean surface air temperature change from 1990 to 2035 for models used in FAR (Figure 6.11 in Bretherton et al., 1990), SAR (Figure 19 in the TS of IPCC, 1996), TAR (full range of TAR Figure 9.13(b) in Cubasch et al., 2001). TAR results are based on the simple climate model analyses presented and not on the individual full three-dimensional climate model simulations. For the AR4 results are presented as single model runs of the CMIP3 ensemble for the historical period from 1950 to 2000 (light grey lines) and for three scenarios (A2, A1B and B1) from 2001 to 2035. The bars at the right-hand side of the graph show the full range given for 2035 for each assessment report. For the three SRES scenarios the bars show the CMIP3 ensemble mean and the likely range given by –40% to +60% of the mean as assessed in Meehl et al. (2007). The publication years of the assessment reports are shown. See Appendix 1.A for details on the data and calculations used to create this figure.

  caption: Main drivers of climate change. The radiative balance between incoming solar shortwave radiation (SWR) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is influenced by global climate ‘drivers’. Natural fluctuations in solar output (solar cycles) can cause changes in the energy balance (through fluctuations in the amount of incoming SWR) (Section 2.3). Human activity changes the emissions of gases and aerosols, which are involved in atmospheric chemical reactions, resulting in modified O3 and aerosol amounts (Section 2.2). O3 and aerosol particles absorb, scatter and reflect SWR, changing the energy balance. Some aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei modifying the properties of cloud droplets and possibly affecting precipitation (Section 7.4). Because cloud interactions with SWR and LWR are large, small changes in the properties of clouds have important implications for the radiative budget (Section 7.4). Anthropogenic changes in GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, O3, CFCs) and large aerosols (>2.5 μm in size) modify the amount of outgoing LWR by absorbing outgoing LWR and re-emitting less energy at a lower temperature (Section 2.2). Surface albedo is changed by changes in vegetation or land surface properties, snow or ice cover and ocean colour (Section 2.3). These changes are driven by natural seasonal and diurnal changes (e.g., snow cover), as well as human influence (e.g., changes in vegetation types) (Forster et al., 2007).

  caption: Schematic diagram showing the relative importance of different uncertainties, and their evolution in time. (a) Decadal mean surface temperature change (°C) from the historical record (black line), with climate model estimates of uncertainty for historical period (grey), along with future climate projections and uncertainty. Values are normalised by means from 1961 to 1980. Natural variability (orange) derives from model interannual variability, and is assumed constant with time. Emission uncertainty (green) is estimated as the model mean difference in projections from different scenarios. Climate response uncertainty (blue-solid) is based on climate model spread, along with added uncertainties from the carbon cycle, as well as rough estimates of additional uncertainty from poorly modelled processes. Based on Hawkins and Sutton (2011) and Huntingford et al. (2009). (b) Climate response uncertainty can appear to increase when a new process is discovered to be relevant, but such increases reflect a quantification of previously unmeasured uncertainty, or (c) can decrease with additional model improvements and observational constraints. The given uncertainty range of 90% means that the temperature is estimated to be in that range, with a probability of 90%.

Where ‘HadISST1’, ‘HadSLP2r’, or ‘NNR’ are indicated, the indices were computed from the sea surface temperature (SST) or sea level pressure (SLP) values of the former two data sets or from 500 or 850 hPa geopotential height fields from the NNR. Data set references given in the panel titles apply to all indices shown in that panel. Where no data set is specified, a publicly available version of an index from the authors of a primary reference given in Box 2.5, Table 1 was used. All indices were standardized with regard to 1971–2000 period except for NIÑO3.4 (centralized for 1971–2000) and AMO indices (centralized for 1901–1970). Indices marked as “detrended” had their linear trend for 1870–2012 removed. All indices are shown as 12-month running means except when the temporal resolution is explicitly indicated (e.g., ‘DJFM’ for December-to-March averages) or smoothing level (e.g., 11-year LPF for a low-pass filter with half-power at 11 years).

  caption: Spatial patterns of climate modes listed in Box 2.5, Table 1. All patterns shown here are obtained by regression of either sea surface temperature (SST) or sea level pressure (SLP) fields on the standardized index of the climate mode. For each climate mode one of the specific indices shown in Box 2.5, Figure 1 was used, as identified in the panel subtitles. SST and SLP fields are from HadISST1 and HadSLP2r data sets (interpolated gridded products based on data sets of historical observations). Regressions were done on monthly means for all patterns except for NAO and PNA, which were done with the DJFM means, and for PSA1 and PSA2, where seasonal means were used. Each regression was done for the longest period within the 1870-2012 interval when the index was available. For each pattern the time series was linearly de-trended over the entire regression interval. All patterns are shown by color plots, except for PSA2, which is shown by white contours over the PSA1 color plot (contour steps are 0.5 hPa, zero contour is skipped, negative values are indicated by dash).

Trends were computed for the annually averaged timeseries of 4° × 4° cells. For all data sets except land station data, an annual mean was considered available only if monthly means for no less than eight months were available in that calendar year. Trend values were computed only if no less than 17 years had values and at least 1 year was available among the first and last 3 years of the period. White areas indicate incomplete or missing data.

RAPID/MOCHA (Rapid Climate Change programme / Meridional Ocean Circulation and Heatflux Array) at 26.5°N (red). The array monitors the top-to-bottom Atlantic wide circulation, ensuring a closed mass balance across the section, and hence a direct measure of the upper and lower limbs of the AMOC. 2. 41°N (black): An index of maximum AMOC strength from Argo float measurements in the upper 2000 m only, combined with satellite altimeter data. The lower limb is not measured. 3. Meridional Overturning Variability Experiment (MOVE) at 16°N (blue) measuring transport of North Atlantic Deep Water in the lower limb of the AMOC between 1100 m and 4800 m depth between the Caribbean and the mid-Atlantic Ridge. This transport is thought to be representative of maximum MOC variability based on model validation experiments. The temporal resolution of the three time series is 10 days for 16°N and 26°N and 1 month for 41°N. The data have been 3-month low-pass filtered. Means and standard deviations for the common period of 2 April 2004 to 1 April 2010 are 17.5 ± 3.8 Sv, 13.8 ± 3.3 Sv and –20.3 ± 4.8 Sv (negative indicating the southward lower limb) for 26.5°N, 41°N and 16°N respectively.

The sea surface height (SSH) trend (cm per decade, colour shading) for the period 1993–2011 is based on the AVISO altimetry “reference” product (Ducet et al., 2000). Spatial gradients in the SSH trend, divided by the (latitude-dependant) Coriolis parameter, are proportional to changes in surface geostrophic velocity. For display, the mean steric height contours and SSH trends are spatially smoothed over 5° longitude and 3° latitude.

Less cold, hence lighter, North Atlantic Deep Water (lighter blue) sinks in the northern North Atlantic Ocean (upper right panel: red and blue arrow in the deep water indicates decadal warming and cooling), then spreads south above the Antarctic Bottom Water. Similarly, in the upper ocean (lower left panel shows Pacific Ocean detail, lower right panel the Atlantic), cool Intermediate Waters (cyan) sink in sub-polar regions (red arrows fading to white indicating warming with time), before spreading toward the equator under warmer Subtropical Waters (green), which in turn sink (red arrows fading to white indicate stronger warming of the intermediate and subtropical waters most recently in contact with the surface) and spread toward the equator under tropical waters, the warmest and lightest (orange) in all three oceans.

  caption: Summary of observed changes in zonal averages of global ocean properties. Temperature trends (degrees Celsius per decade) are indicated in colour (red = warming, blue = cooling); salinity trends are indicated by contour lines (dashed = fresher; solid = saltier) for the upper 2000 m of the water column (50-year trends from data set of Durack and Wijffels (2010); trends significant at >90% confidence are shown). Arrows indicate primary ventilation pathways. Changes in other physical and chemical properties are summarised to the right of the figure, for each depth range (broken axes symbols delimit changes in vertical scale). Increases are shown in red, followed by a plus sign; decreases are shown in blue, followed by a minus sign; the number of + and – signs indicates the level of confidence associated with the observation of change (+++, high confidence; ++, medium confidence; +, low confidence). T = temperature, S = salinity, Strat = stratification, Cant = anthropogenic carbon, CO32– = carbonate ion, NA = North Atlantic, SO = Southern Ocean, AABW = Antarctic Bottom Water. S > –S refers to the salinity averaged over regions where the sea surface salinity is greater than the global mean sea surface salinity; S < –S refers to the average over regions with values below the global mean.

  caption: Annual anomalies of the average thickness of seasonally frozen depth in Russia from 1930 to 2000. Each data point represents a composite from 320 stations as compiled at the Russian Hydrometeorological Stations (RHM) (upper right inset). The composite was produced by taking the sum of the thickness measurements from each station and dividing the result by the number of stations operating in that year. Although the total number of stations is 320, the number providing data may be different for each year but the minimum was 240. The yearly anomaly was calculated by subtracting the 1971–2000 mean from the composite for each year. The thin lines indicate the 1 standard deviation (1σ) (likely) uncertainty range. The line shows a negative trend of –4.5 cm per decade or a total decrease in the thickness of seasonally frozen ground of 31.9 cm from 1930 to 2000 (Frauenfeld and Zhang, 2011).

The yellow line is the average location of the ice edge (15% ice concentration) for the yearly minima from 1979 to 2012. Areas of continuous permafrost (see Glossary) are shown in dark pink, discontinuous permafrost in light pink. The green line along the southern border of the map shows the maximum snow extent while the black line across North America, Europe and Asia shows the 50% contour for frequency of snow occurrence. The Greenland ice sheet (blue/grey) and locations of glaciers (small gold circles) are also shown. The map of the Southern Hemisphere shows approximately the maximum sea ice cover during an austral winter (13 September 2012). The yellow line shows the average ice edge (15% ice concentration) during maximum extent of the sea ice cover from 1979 to 2012. Some of the elements (e.g., some glaciers and snow) located at low latitudes are not visible in this projection (see Figure 4.8). The source of the data for sea ice, permafrost, snow and ice sheet are data sets held at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), University of Colorado, on behalf of the North American Atlas, Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática (Mexico), Natural Resources Canada, U.S. Geological Survey, Government of Canada, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing and The Atlas of Canada.

  caption: Global cumulative (top graphs) and annual (lower graphs) glacier mass change for (a) 1801–2010 and (b) 1961–2010. The cumulative estimates are all set to zero mean over 1986–2005. Estimates are based on glacier length variations (updated from Leclercq et al., 2011), from area-weighted extrapolations of individual directly and geodetically measured glacier mass budgets (updated from Cogley, 2009b), and from modelling with atmospheric variables as input (Marzeion et al., 2012; Hirabayashi et al., 2013). Uncertainties are based on comprehensive error analyses in Cogley (2009b) and Marzeion et al. (2012) and on assumptions about the representativeness of the sampled glaciers in Leclercq et al. (2011). Hirabayashi et al. (2013) give a bulk error estimate only. For clarity in the bottom panels, uncertainties are shown only for the Cogley and Marzeion 4 curves excluding Greenland (GL). The blue bars (a, top) show the number of measured single-glacier mass balances per pentad in the updated Cogley (2009b) time series. The mean 2003–2009 estimate of Gardner et al. (2013) is added to b, bottom.

  caption: Simulated and reconstructed temperature changes for key periods in the last millennium. Annual temperature differences for: (a) to (c) Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950–1250) minus Little Ice Age (LIA, 1450–1850); (d) to (f) present (1950–2000) minus MCA; (g) to (i) present minus LIA. Model temperature differences (left and middle columns) are average temperature changes in the ensemble of available model simulations of the last millennium, grouped into those using stronger (total solar irradiance (TSI) change from the Late Maunder Minimum (LMM) to present >0.23%; left column; SS in Table 5.A.1) or weaker solar forcing changes (TSI change from the LMM to present <0.1%; middle column; SW in Table 5.A.1). Right column panels (c, f, i) show differences (shading) for the Mann et al. (2009) field reconstruction. In (c), dots represent additionally proxy differences from Ljungqvist et al. (2012), scaled by 0.5 for display purposes. The distribution, type and temporal span of the input data used in the field reconstruction of Mann et al. (2009) are shown in (j); proxy types are included in the legend, acronyms stand for: tree-ring maximum latewood density (MXD); tree-ring width (TRW); regional TRW composite (TRW-RC); and multi-proxy 5 climate field reconstruction (CFR). Dotted grid-cells indicate non-significant differences (<0.05 level) in reconstructed fields (right) or that <80% of the simulations showed significant changes of the same sign (left and middle). For simulations starting after 950, the period 1000–1250 was used to estimate MCA values. Grid cells outside the domain of the Mann et al. (2009) reconstruction are shaded grey in the model panels to enable easier comparison, though contours (interval 0.2 K) illustrate model output over the complete global domain. Only simulations spanning the whole millennium and including at least solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing have been used (Table 5.A.1): BCC-csm1-1 (1), CCSM3 (1), CCSM4 (1), CNRM-CM3.3, CSIRO-mk3L-1-2 (4), CSM1.4 (1), ECHAM5-MPIOM (8), ECHO-G (1), MPI-ESM-P (1), FGOALS-gl (1), GISS-E2-R (3), HadCM3 (1), IPSL-CM5A-LR (1). Averages for each model are calculated first, to avoid models with multiple simulations having greater influence on the ensemble means shown here.

(c) Response to multi-decadal periods of volcanic activity. (d) Response to multi-decadal variations in solar activity. (e) Mean change from the MCA to the LIA. (f) Mean change from 20th century to LIA. Note that some reconstructions represent a smaller spatial domain than the full Northern Hemisphere (NH) or a specific season, while annual temperatures for the full NH mean are shown for the simulations. (a) Simulations shown by coloured lines (thick lines: multimodel-mean; thin lines: multi-model 90% range; red/blue lines: models forced by stronger/weaker solar variability, though other forcings and model sensitivities also differ between the red and blue groups); overlap of reconstructed temperatures shown by grey shading; all data are expressed as anomalies from their 1500–1850 mean and smoothed with a 30-year filter. Superposed composites (time segments from selected periods positioned so that the years with peak negative forcing are aligned) of the forcing and temperature response to: (b) 12 of the strongest individual volcanic forcing events after 1400 (the data shown are not smoothed); (c) multi-decadal changes in volcanic activity; (d) multi-decadal changes in solar irradiance. Upper panels show volcanic or solar forcing for the individual selected periods together with the composite mean (thick line); in (d), the composite mean of volcanic forcing (green) during the solar composite is also shown. Lower panels show the NH temperature composite means and 90% range of spread between simulations (red line, pink shading) or reconstructions (grey line and shading), with overlap indicated by darker shading.

Where an ensemble of simulations is available from one model, the ensemble mean is shown in solid and the individual ensemble members by open circles. Results are sorted into ascending order and labelled. Reconstructions, models and further details are given in Appendix 5.A.1 and Tables 5.A.1 and 5.A.6.

The box in (a) and (d) indicates the region over which the tree-ring reconstructed Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values have been averaged to form the regional mean time series shown in (c) and (f), respectively. Solid black lines in (c) and (f) are a 9-year Gaussian smooth on the annual data shown by the red and blue bars. The covariance of drought (PDSI <0) duration and cumulative severity for each region is shown in panels (b) and (e) by the red circles (corresponding to the left y-axes), along with the respective marginal frequency histograms for each quantity. Not shown in b) is an outlier with an apparent duration of 24 years, corresponding to the ‘Strange Parallels’ drought identified in Cook et al. (2010b). Intervals between droughts of given durations are shown in the same panels and are estimated as the mean interval between their occurrence, with the minimum and maximum reconstructed intervals indicated (corresponding to the right y-axes, shown as connected lines and their corresponding range). No error bars are present if there are fewer than three observations of a drought of that duration. The period of analysis is restricted by the availability of tree-ring data to the period 1300–1989 for Monsoon Asia, following Cook et al. (2010a), and from 800 to 1978 for southwestern North America, following Cook et al. (2004).

  caption: Regional temperature reconstructions, comparison with model simulations over the past millennium (950–2010). Temperature anomalies (thick black line), and uncertainty estimated provided by each individual reconstruction (grey envelope). Uncertainties: Arctic: 90% confidence bands. Antarctica, Australasia, North American pollen and South America: ±2 standard deviation. Asia: ±2 root mean square error. Europe: 95% confidence bands. North American trees: upper/lower 5% bootstrap bounds. Simulations are separated into 2 groups: High solar forcing (red thick line), and weak solar forcing (blue thick line). For each model sub-group, uncertainty is shown as 1.645 times sigma level (light red and blue lines). For comparison with instrumental record, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Gridded Dataset of Global Historical Near-Surface Air TEMperature Anomalies Over Land version 4 (CRUTEM4) data set is shown (yellow line). These instrumental data are not necessarily those used in calibration of the reconstructions, and thus may show greater or lesser correspondence with the reconstructions than the instrumental data actually used for calibration; cut-off timing may also lead to end effects for the smoothed data shown. Cf. PAGES 2k Consortium (2013, SOM) in this regard for the North America reconstruction. Green bars in rectangles on top of each panel indicate the 30 warmest years in the 950–1250 period (left rectangle) and 1800–2010 period (right rectangle). All lines are smoothed by applying a 30 year moving average. Map at bottom right shows the individual regions for each reconstruction, and in bars the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950-1250) – Little Ice Age (LIA, 1450-1850) differences over those regions. Reconstructions: from PAGES 2k Consortium (2013). Models used: simulations with strong solar forcing (mostly pre-Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (pre-PMIP3) simulations): CCSM3 (1), CNRM-CM3.3 (1), CSM1.4 (1), CSIRO-MK3L-1-2 (3), ECHAM5/MPIOM (3), ECHO-G (1) IPSLCM4 (1), FGOALS-gl (1). Simulations with weak solar forcing (mostly PMIP3/ CMIP5 simulations): BCC-csm1-1 (1), CCSM4 (1), CSIRO-MK3L-1-2 (1), GISS-E2-R (3, ensemble members 121, 124, 127), HadCM3 (1), MPI-ESM, ECHAM5/MPIOM (5), IPSL-CM5ALR (1). In parenthesis are the number of simulations used for each model. All simulations are treated individually, in the time series as well as in the MCA–LIA bars. More information about forcings used in simulations and corresponding references are given in Table 5.A.1. Time periods for averaging are JJA for June – July – August, SONDJF for the months from September to February, and DJF for December – January – February, respectively, while ANN denotes annual mean.

Left: Multi-model average of relative changes (%) in amplitude of the mean seasonal cycle of Niño 3 SST for mid Holocene (MH) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) time-slice experiments and for freshwater perturbation experiments (Hosing) that lead to a weakening of the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) by more than 50%. Bars encompass the 25 and 75 percentiles, with the red horizontal lines indicating the median in the respective multi-model ensemble, red crosses are values in the upper and lower quartile of the distribution; Right: same as left, but for the SST anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region, representing El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The MH ensemble includes 4 experiments performed by models participating in Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase II (PMIP2) (FGOALS1.0g, IPSLCM4, MIROC3.2 medres, CCSM3.0) and 7 experiments (mid-Holocene) performed by models participating in PMIP3/CMIP5 (CCSM4.0, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2ES, MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-P, MRI-CGCM3). The LGM ensemble includes 5 experiments performed by models participating in PMIP2 (FGOALS1.0g, IPSL-CM4, MIROC3.2 medres, CCSM3.0, HadCM3) and 5 experiments (LGM) performed by models participating in PMIP3/CMIP5 (CCSM4, GISS-E2-R, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM, and MPI-ESM-P). The changes in response to MH and LGM forcing are computed with respect to the pre-industrial control simulations coordinated by PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5. The results for Hosing are obtained from freshwater perturbation experiments conducted with CCSM2.0, CCSM3.0, HadCM3, ECHAM5-MPIOM, GFDL-CM2.1 (Timmermann et al., 2007), CSM1.4 (Bozbiyik et al., 2011) for pre-industrial or present-day conditions and with CCSM3 for glacial conditions (Merkel et al., 2010). The changes in response to fresh water forcing are computed with respect the portion of simulations when the AMOC is high.

Top panels are pollen-based reconstructions of Bartlein et al., (2011) with anomalies defined as compared to modern, which varies among the records. The bulk of the records fall within the range of 5.5 to 6.5 ka, with only 3.5% falling outside this range. Middle panels are corresponding surface temperature anomalies simulated by the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase II (PMIP2) and Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3)/ Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models for 6 ka as compared to pre-industrial. Bottom panels contain boxplots for reconstructions (grey), for model ensembles and for the individual CMIP5 models interpolated to the locations of the reconstructions. Included are OA (ocean–atmosphere), OAV (ocean–atmosphere–vegetation), and OAC (ocean–atmosphere–carbon cycle) models. The boxes are drawn using the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles (bottom, middle and top of the box, respectively), and whiskers extend to the 5th and 95th percentiles of data or model results within each area. The northern extratropics are defined as 30°N to 90oN and the tropics as 30oS to 30oN. For additional model–data comparisons for the mid-Holocene, see Section 9.4.1.4 and Figures 9.11 and 9.12.

  caption: Sea level during the Last Interglacial (LIG) period. (a) Proxy-derived estimate of global mean sea level (GMSL) anomaly from Kopp et al. (2013). Mean GMSL (red line), 67% confidence limits (blue dashed lines) and 95% confidence limits (green dashed lines). The chronology is based on open-system U/Th dates. (b) Local LIG relative sea level reconstructions from Western Australia based on in situ coral elevations (red) that pass diagenetic screening (Dutton and Lambeck, 2012). Age error bars correspond to 2 standard deviation uncertainties. All elevations have been normalised to the upper growth limit of corals corresponding to mean low water spring or mean low sea level. The blue line indicates the simplest interpretation of local sea level consistent with reef stratigraphy and should be considered as lower limits by an amount indicated by the blue upper limit error bars. The chronology is based on closed system U/Th dates. (c) Predicted sea levels for selected sites in the Caribbean and North Atlantic in the absence of tectonics with the assumption that ice volumes during the interval from 129 to 116 ka are equal to those of today (Lambeck et al., 2012) illustrating the spatial variability expected across the region due to glacio-isostatic effects of primarily the MIS-6 and MIS-2 deglaciations (see also Raymo and Mitrovica, 2012). The reference ice-volume model for the LIG interval (blue shaded), earth rheology and ice sheet parameters are based on rebound analyses from different regions spanning the interval from Marine Isotope Stage 6 to the present (c.f. Lambeck et al., 2006). LIG sea level observations from these sites contain information on these ice histories and on GMSL. (d) Same as (c) but for different sites along the Western Australia coast contributing to the data set in (b). The dependence on details of the ice sheet and on Earth-model parameters is less important at these sites than for those in (c). Thus data from these locations, assuming tectonic stability, is more appropriate for estimating GMSL. (e) The Western Australian reconstructed evidence (blue) from (b), compared with the modelpredicted result (red) for a reference site midway between the northern and southern most localities. The difference between the reconstructed and predicted functions provides an estimate of GMSL (green). Uncertainties in this estimate (67% confidence limits) include the observational uncertainties from (b) and model uncertainties (see e.g., Lambeck et al., 2004a, for a treatment of model errors). (f) Simulated contribution of GIS to GMSL change (black, Q, Quiquet et al. (2013); red, R, Robinson et al. (2011); blue, S, Stone et al. (2013), The Q, R, S correspond to the labels in Figure 5.16). (g) Simulated total GMSL contribution from the GIS (Q, R, S as in panel (f)) and the Antarctic ice sheet contribution (PD) according to Pollard and DeConto (2009). (h) Central Greenland surface-air temperature anomalies for summer (June–August, JJA) used for ice sheet simulations displayed in panel (f) and in Figure 5.16. Anomalies in all panels are calculated relative to present.

  caption: Flood frequency from paleofloods, historical and instrumental records in selected European rivers. Depicted is the number of floods exceeding a particular discharge threshold or flood height over periods of 20 years (bidecadal). Flood categories include rare or catastrophic floods (CAT) associated with high flood discharge or severe damages, and extraordinary floods (EXT) causing inundation of the floodplain with moderate-to-minor damages. Legend at each panel indicates for each category the period of record in years, number of floods (n) over the period, and the average occurrence interval (T in years). (a) Tagus River combined paleoflood, historical and instrumental flood records from Aranjuez and Toledo with thresholds of 100–400 m3 s–1 (EXT) and >400 m3 s–1 (CAT) (data from Benito et al., 2003a; 2003b). (b) Segura River Basin (SE Spain) documentary and instrumental records at Murcia (Barriendos and Rodrigo, 2006; Machado et al., 2011). (c) Gardon River combined discharges from paleofloods at La Baume (Sheffer et al., 2008), documented floods (since the 15th century) and historical and daily water stage readings at Anduze (1741–2005; Neppel et al., 2010). Discharge thresholds referred to Anduze are 1000 to 3000 m3 s–1 (EXT), >3000 m3 s–1 (CAT). At least five floods larger than the 2002 flood (the largest in the gauged record) occurred in the period 1400–1800 (Sheffer et al., 2008). (d) Tiber River floods in Rome from observed historical stages (since 1100; Camuffo and Enzi, 1996; Calenda et al., 2005) and continuous stage readings (1870 to present) at the Ripetta landing (Calenda et al., 2005). Discharge thresholds set at 2300 to 2900 m3 s–1 (EXT) and >2900 m3 s–1 (CAT; >17 m stage at Ripetta). Recent flooding is difficult to evaluate in context due to river regulation structures. (e) River Ouse at York combined documentary and instrumental flood record (Macdonald and Black, 2010). Discharge thresholds for large floods were set at 500 m3 s–1 (CAT) and 350 to 500 m3 s–1 (EXT). (f) Vltava River combined documentary and instrumental flood record at Prague (Brázdil et al., 2005) discharge thresholds: CAT, flood index 2 and 3 or discharge >2900 m3 s–1 ; EXT flood index 1 or discharge 2000 to 2900 m3 s–1 . (g) Elbe River combined documentary and instrumental flood record (Mudelsee et al., 2003). Classes refer to Mudelsee et al. (2003) strong (EXT) and exceptionally strong (CAT) flooding. (h) Oder River combined documentary and instrumental flood record (Mudelsee et al., 2003). The map shows the location of rivers used in the flood frequency plots. Note that flood frequencies obtained from historical sources may be down biased in the early part of the reported periods owing to document loss.

White squares in each panel show the locations of ice core sites: Greenland Ice Core Project/Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GRIP/GISP) from the summit (G), North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) (NG), North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) (NE), Camp Century (C), and Dye3 (D). For ice sheet simulations using transient climate forcing, the minimum in ice volume is illustrated. All panels use original model resolution and grids. Below each panel, maximum contribution to global mean sea level rise and time of minimum ice volume are denoted together with information on experimental design (either “transient” run of the Interglacial period starting from the former glacial or “equilibrium” run of a time slice at the peak interglacial). The differences in model outputs regarding timing and ice elevations result from different methodologies (e.g., transient climate change or equilibrium climate, with the latter assumption leading to the highest estimate of the four models), melt schemes (van de Berg et al., 2011), and the reference climate input (Quiquet et al., 2013).

  caption: Observational evidence for sea level change in the recent and late Holocene. Left panels (a–d): High-resolution, relative sea level results from salt-marsh data at representative sites, without corrections for glacial isostatic movement of land and sea surfaces. Locations are given on the map. The North Carolina (a) result is based on two nearby locations, Tump Point (dark blue) and Sand Point (light blue). They are representative of other North American Atlantic coast locations (e.g., b; Kemp et al., 2011). The rate of change occurring late in the 19th century are seen in all high resolution salt-marsh records—e.g., in New Zealand (c) (Gehrels et al., 2008; Gehrels and Woodworth, 2013) and in Spain (d) (Leorri et al., 2008; García-Artola et al., 2009)—that extend into modern time and is consistent with Roman archaeological evidence (Lambeck et al., 2004b). The oscillation in sea level seen in the North Carolina record at about 1000 years ago occurs in some (González and Törnqvist, 2009) but not all records (cf. Gehrels et al., 2011; Kemp et al., 2011). Right hand side panels (g–j): Observational evidence for sea level change from lower resolution but longer period records. All records are uncorrected for isostatic effects resulting in spatially variable near-linear trend in sea level over the 7000-year period. The Kiritimati record (Christmas Island) (g) consists of coral microatoll elevations whose fossil elevations are with respect to the growth position of living microatolls (Woodroffe et al., 2012). The North Queensland record (h) is also based on microatoll evidence from several sites on Orpheus Island (Chappell, 1983; Lambeck et al., 2002a). The data from Mediterranean France (i) is based on biological indicators (Laborel et al., 1994) restricted to three nearby locations between which differential isostatic effects are less than the observational errors (Lambeck and Bard, 2000). The Spanish record (j) from estuarine sedimentary deposits is for two nearby localities; Bilboa (dark blue) and Urdaibai (light blue) (Leorri et al., 2012). The two global records (central panels) are estimates of change in global mean sea level from (i) the instrumental record (Jevrejeva et al., 2008) that overlaps the salt-marsh records, and (j) from a range of geological and archaeological indicators from different localities around the world (Lambeck et al., 2010), with the contributing records corrected individually for the isostatic effects at each location.

  caption: (Top) Orbital-scale Earth system responses to radiative forcings and perturbations from 3.5 Ma to present. Reconstructed dust mass accumulation rate is from the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (red) (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011). Sea level curve (blue) is the stacked d18O proxy for ice volume and ocean temperature (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) calibrated to global average eustatic sea level (Naish and Wilson, 2009; Miller et al., 2012a).

Weighted mean estimates (2 standard deviation uncertainty) for far-field reconstructions of eustatic peaks are shown for mid-Pliocene interglacials (red dots; Miller et al., 2012a). The dashed horizontal line represents present-day sea level. Tropical sea surface temperature (black line) based on a stack of four alkenone-based sea surface temperature reconstructions (Herbert et al., 2010).

Present (2012) and pre-industrial CO2 concentrations are indicated with long-dashed and short-dashed grey lines, respectively. (Bottom) Concentration of atmospheric CO2 for the last 65 Ma is reconstructed from marine and terrestrial proxies (Cerling, 1992; Freeman and Hayes, 1992; Koch et al., 1992; Stott, 1992; van der Burgh et al., 1993; Sinha and Stott, 1994; Kürschner, 1996; McElwain, 1998; Ekart et al., 1999; Pagani et al., 1999a, 1999b, 2005a, 2005b, 2010, 2011; Kürschner et al., 2001, 2008; Royer et al., 2001a, 2001b; Beerling et al., 2002, 2009; Beerling and Royer, 2002; Nordt et al., 2002; Greenwood et al., 2003; Royer, 2003; Lowenstein and Demicco, 2006; Fletcher et al., 2008; Pearson et al., 2009; Retallack, 2009b, 2009a; Tripati et al., 2009;Seki et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010; Bartoli et al., 2011; Doria et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2012). Individual proxy methods are colour-coded (see also Table A5.1). The light blue shading is a 1-standard deviation uncertainty band constructed using block bootstrap resampling (Mudelsee et al., 2012) for a kernel regression through all the data points with a bandwidth of 8 Myr prior to 30 Ma, and 1 Myr from 30 Ma to present. Most of the data points for CO2 proxies are based on duplicate and multiple analyses. The red box labelled MPWP represents the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (3.3 to 3.0 Ma; Table 5.1).

The time periods are 2081–2100 for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 (top row), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, second row), mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP, third row) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, bottom row). Model temperature anomalies are calculated relative to the pre-industrial value of each model in the ensemble prior to calculating the MMM anomaly (a, d; colour shading). Zonal MMM gradients (b, c) are plotted with a shaded band indicating 2 standard deviations. Site specific temperature anomalies estimated from proxy data are calculated relative to present site temperatures and are plotted (a, d) using the same colour scale as the model data, and a circle-size scaled to estimates of confidence. Proxy data compilations for the LGM are from Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean surface (MARGO) Project Members (2009) and Bartlein et al. (2011), for the MPWP are from Dowsett et al. (2012), Salzmann et al. (2008) and Haywood et al. (2013) and for the EECO are from Hollis et al. (2012) and Lunt et al. (2012). Model ensemble simulations for 2081–2100 are from the CMIP5 ensemble using RCP 8.5, for the LGM are seven Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, for the Pliocene are from Haywood et al., (2013), and for the EECO are after Lunt et al.

Volcanic sulphate peaks identified from their isotopic composition as originating from the stratosphere are indicated by squares (green: Greenland; brown: Antarctica) (Baroni et al., 2008; Cole-Dai et al., 2009). (b) Reconstructed total solar irradiance (TSI) anomalies back to the year 1000. Proxies of solar activity (e.g., sunspots, 10Be) are used to estimate the parameters of the models or directly TSI. All records except LBB (Lean et al., 1995b) have been used for PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations (Schmidt et al., 2011). DB: Delaygue and Bard (2011); MEA: Muscheler et al. (2007); SBF: Steinhilber et al. (2009); WLS: Wang et al. (2005); VSK: Vieira et al. (2011). For the years prior to 1600, the 11-year cycle has been added artificially to the original data with an amplitude proportional to the mean level of TSI. (c) Reconstructed TSI anomalies (100-year low-pass filtered; grey shading: 1 standard deviation uncertainty range) for the past 9300 years (Steinhilber et al., 2009). The reconstruction is based on 10Be and calibrated using the relationship between instrumental data of the open magnetic field, which modulates the production of 10Be, and TSI for the past four solar minima. The yellow band indicates the past 1000 years shown in more details in (a) and (b). Anomalies are relative to the 1976–2006 mean value (1366.14 W m–2) of Wang et al. (2005).

  caption: (a) Relation between equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) estimated from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) simulations and that estimated from equilibrium 2 × CO2 or abrupt 4 × CO2 experiments. All experiments are referenced to pre-industrial simulations. Flexible Global Ocean Atmosphere Land System model version 1 (FGOALS1), Institut Pierre Simon Laplace version 4 (IPSL4), Max Planck Institute version 5 (MPI5), and ECBILT of Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase II (PMIP2) models stand for FGOALS-1.0g, IPSL-CM4-V1-MR, European Centre Hamburg Model 5 – and Max Planck Institute Ocean Model – Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Model (LPJ), and Coupled Atmosphere Ocean Model from de Bilt (ECBilt) with Coupled Large-scale Ice-Ocean model (CLIO), respectively. Flexible Global Ocean Atmosphere Land System model-2 (FGOALS2), Institut Pierre Simon Laplace 5 (IPSL5), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC3), Max Planck Institute für Meteorologie Earth system model (MPIE), Meteorological Research Institute of Japan Meteorological Agency version 3 (MRI3) and Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques version 5 (CNRM5) of Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3) models stand for FGOALS-g2, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-P, MRI-CGCM3, and CNRM-CM5, respectively. ECS based on LGM simulations (abscissa) was derived by multiplying the LGM global mean temperature anomaly (DTLGM) and the ratio of radiative forcing between 2 × CO2 and LGM (DFratio). DFratio for three PMIP2 models (Community Climate System Model-3 (CCSM3), Met Office Hadley Centre climate prediction models-3 (HadCM3) and IPSL4) were taken from Crucifix (2006), and it was taken from Yoshimori et al. (2009) for MIROC3. Its range, –0.80 to –0.56, with a mean of –0.69 was used for other PMIP2 and all PMIP3 models. ECS of PMIP2 models (ordinate) was taken from Hargreaves et al. (2012). ECS of PMIP3 models was taken from Andrews et al. (2012) and Brady et al. (2013), or computed using the method of Andrews et al. (2012) for FGOALS2. Also plotted is a one-to-one line. (b) Strength of individual feedbacks for the PMIP3/CMIP5 abrupt 4 × CO2 (131 to 150 years) and LGM (stable states) experiments following the method in Yoshimori et al. (2011). WV+LR, A, CSW and CLW denote water vapour plus lapse rate, surface albedo, shortwave cloud, and longwave cloud feedbacks, respectively. ‘All’ denotes the sum of all feedbacks except for the Planck response. Feedback parameter here is defined as the change in net radiation at the top of the atmosphere due to the change in individual fields, such as water vapour, with respect to the pre-industrial simulations. It was normalized by the global mean surface air temperature change. Positive (negative) value indicates that the feedback amplifies (damp) the initial temperature response. Only models with all necessary data available for the analysis are displayed. (c) Relation between LGM tropical (20°S to 30°N) surface air temperature anomaly from pre-industrial simulations and ECS across models. A dark blue bar represents a 90% confidence interval for the estimate of reconstructed temperature anomaly of Annan and Hargreaves (2013). A light blue bar represents the same with additional 0.4°C anomaly increase according to the result of the sensitivity experiment conducted in Annan and Hargreaves (2013), in which additional 1°C lowering of tropical SST proxy data was assumed. (d) Same as in (c) but for the average of East Antarctica ice core sites of Dome F, Vostok, European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dome C and Droning Maud Land ice cores. A dark blue bar represents a range of reconstructed temperature anomaly based on stable isotopes at these core sites (Stenni et al., 2010; Uemura et al., 2012). A value below zero is not displayed (the result of CNRM5). Note that the Antarctic ice sheet used for PMIP3 simulations, based on several different methods (Tarasov and Peltier, 2007; Argus and Peltier, 2010; Lambeck et al., 2010) differs in elevation from that used in PMIP2 (d).

  caption: Changes in surface temperature for the Last Interglacial (LIG) as reconstructed from data and simulated by an ensemble of climate model experiments in response to orbital and well-mixed greenhouse gas (WMGHG) forcings. (a) Proxy data syntheses of annual surface temperature anomalies as published by Turney and Jones (2010) and McKay et al. (2011). McKay et al., (2011) calculated an annual anomaly for each record as the average sea surface temperature (SST) of the 5-kyr period centred on the warmest temperature between 135 ka and 118 ka and then subtracting the average SST of the late Holocene (last 5 kyr). Turney and Jones (2010) calculated the annual temperature anomalies relative to 1961–1990 by averaging the LIG temperature estimates across the isotopic plateau in the marine and ice records and the period of maximum warmth in the terrestrial records (assuming globally synchronous terrestrial warmth). (b) Multi-model average of annual surface air temperature anomalies simulated for the LIG computed with respect to preindustrial. The results for the LIG are obtained from 16 simulations for 128 to 125 ka conducted by 13 modelling groups (Lunt et al., 2013). (c) Seasonal SST anomalies. Multi-model zonal averages are shown as solid line with shaded bands indicating 2 standard deviations. Plotted values are the respective seasonal multi-mean global average. Symbols are individual proxy records of seasonal SST anomalies from McKay et al. (2011). (d) Seasonal terrestrial surface temperature anomalies (SAT).

Red bars show, for each scenario, the mean land carbon sequestration from the same ensemble of carbon-only models after correcting for inferred constraints on carbon uptake due to limited availability of nitrogen. Black bars show ± one standard deviation around the means. Black symbols show individual model results from the two CMIP5 models with explicit carbon–nitrogen interactions (Community Earth System Model 1–Biogeochemical (CESM1-BGC) and Norwegian Earth System Model 1 (Emissions capable) (NorESM1-ME)). These two models have nearly identical representations of land carbon–nitrogen dynamics, and differences between them here (for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, where both models contributed results) are due to differences in coupled system climate. All simulations shown here used prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

  caption: Comparison of carbon cycle feedback metrics between the C4MIP ensemble of seven GCMs and four EMICs under the Special Report on Emission Scenario-A2 (SRES-A2) (Friedlingstein et al., 2006) and the eight CMIP5 models (Arora et al., 2013) under the 140-year 1% CO2 increase per year scenario. Black dots represent a single model simulation and coloured bars the mean of the multi-model results; grey dots are used for models with a coupled terrestrial nitrogen cycle. The comparison with C4MIP is for context, but these metrics are known to be variable across different scenarios and rates of change (see Section 6.4.2.2). Some of the CMIP5 models are derived from models that contributed to C4MIP and some are new to this analysis. Table 6.11 lists the main attributes of each CMIP5 model used in this analysis. The SRES A2 scenario is closer in rate of change to a 0.5% yr–1 scenario and as such it should be expected that the CMIP5 γ terms are comparable, but the β terms are likely to be around 20% smaller for CMIP5 than for C4MIP due to lags in the ability of the land and ocean to respond to higher rates of CO2 increase (Gregory et al., 2009). This dependence on scenario (Section 6.4.2.2) reduces confidence in any quantitative statements of how CMIP5 carbon cycle feedbacks differ from C4MIP. CMIP5 models used: Max Planck Institute–Earth System Model–Low Resolution (MPI–ESM–LR), Beijing Climate Center–Climate System Model 1 (BCC–CSM1), Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 2–Earth System (HadGEM2–ES), Institute Pierre Simon Laplace–Coupled Model 5A–Low Resolution (IPSL–CM5A–LR), Canadian Earth System Model 2 (CanESM2), Norwegian Earth System Model– intermediate resolution with carbon cycle (NorESM– ME), Community Earth System Model 1–Biogeochemical (CESM1–BGC), Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate–Earth System Model (MIROC–ESM).

  caption: A synthesis of the magnitude of biogeochemical feedbacks on climate. Gregory et al. (2009) proposed a framework for expressing non-climate feedbacks in common units (W m–2 °C–1) with physical feedbacks, and Arneth et al. (2010) extended this beyond carbon cycle feedbacks to other terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks. The figure shows the results compiled by Arneth et al. (2010), with ocean carbon feedbacks from the C4MIP coupled climate–carbon models used for AR4 also added. Some further biogeochemical feedbacks are also shown but this list is not exhaustive. Black dots represent single estimates, and coloured bars denote the simple mean of the dots with no weighting or assessment being made to likelihood of any single estimate. There is low confidence in the magnitude of the feedbacks in the lower portion of the figure, especially for those with few, or only one, dot. The role of nitrogen limitation on terrestrial carbon sinks is also shown—this is not a separate feedback, but rather a modulation to the climate–carbon and concentration–carbon feedbacks. These feedback metrics are also to be state or scenario dependent and so cannot always be compared like-for-like (see Section 6.4.2.2). Results have been compiled from (a) Arneth et al. (2010), (b) Friedlingstein et al. (2006), (c) Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 2-Earth System (HadGEM2-ES, Collins et al., 2011) simulations, (d) Burke et al. (2013), (e) von Deimling et al.

  caption: Schematic synthesis of the magnitude and time scales associated with possible future CH4 emissions (adapted from O’Connor et al., 2010). Uncertainty in these future changes is large, and so this figure demonstrates the relative magnitude of possible future changes. Anthropogenic emissions starting at a present-day level of 300 Tg(CH4) yr–1 (consistent with Table 6.8) and increasing or decreasing according to RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 are shown for reference. Wetland emissions are taken as 140 to 280 Tg(CH4) yr–1 present day values (Table 6.8) and increasing by between 0 and 100% (Section 6.4.7.1; Figure 6.37). Permafrost emissions may become important during the 21st century. CH4 release from marine hydrates and subsea permafrost may also occur but uncertainty is sufficient to prevent plotting emission rates here. Large CH4 hydrate release to the atmosphere is not expected during the 21st century. No quantitative estimates of future changes in CH4 emissions from wildfires exist, so plotted here are continued present-day emissions of 1 to 5 Tg(CH4) yr–1 (Table 6.8).

  caption: Changes in atmospheric, land and ocean fraction of fossil fuel carbon emissions. The fractions are defined as the changes in storage in each component (atmosphere, land, ocean) divided by the compatible fossil fuel emissions derived from each CMIP5 simulation for the four RCP scenarios. Solid circles show the observed estimate based on Table 6.1 for the 1990s. The coloured bars denote the cumulative uptake fractions for the 21st century under the different RCP scenarios for each model. Multi-model mean values are shown as star symbols and the multi-model range (min-to-max) and standard deviation are shown by thin and thick vertical lines respectively. Owing to the difficulty of estimating land use emissions from the ESMs this figure uses a fossil fuel definition of airborne fraction, rather than the preferred definition of fossil and land use emissions discussed in Section 6.3.2.4. 21st century cumulative atmosphere, land and ocean fractions are shown here in preference to the more commonly shown instantaneous fractions because for RCP2.6 emissions reach and cross zero for some models and so an instantaneous definition of AF becomes singular at that point.

(Top) Fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions by category, estimated by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) based on UN energy statistics for fossil fuel combustion and US Geological Survey 6 for cement production (Boden et al., 2011). (Bottom) Fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions as above. CO2 emissions from net land use change, mainly deforestation, are based on land cover change data and estimated for 1750–1850 from the average of four models (Pongratz et al., 2009;   Shevliakova et al., 2009; van Minnen et al., 2009; Zaehle et al., 2011) before 1850 and from Houghton et al. (2012) after 1850 (see Table 6.2). The atmospheric CO2 growth rate (term in light blue ‘atmosphere from measurements’ in the figure) prior to 1959 is based on a spline fit to ice core observations (Neftel et al., 1982; Friedli et al., 1986; Etheridge et al., 1996) and a synthesis of atmospheric measurementsfrom 1959 (Ballantyne et al., 2012). The fit to ice core observations does not capture the large interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 and is represented with a dashed line. The ocean CO2 sink prior to 1959 (term in dark blue ‘ocean from indirect observations and models’ in the figure) is from Khatiwala et al. (2009) and from a combination of modelsand observations from 1959 from (Le Quéré et al., 2013). The residual land sink (term in green in the figure) is computed from the residual of the other terms, and represents the sink of anthropogenic CO2 in natural land ecosystems. The emissions and their partitioning only include the fluxes that have changed since 1750, and not the natural CO2 fluxes (e.g., atmospheric CO2 uptake from weathering, outgassing of CO2 from lakes and rivers, and outgassing of CO2 by the ocean from carbon delivered by rivers; see Figure 6.1) between the atmosphere, land and ocean reservoirs that existed before that time and still exist today. The uncertainties in the various terms are discussed in the text and reported in Table 6.1 for decadal mean values.

The ensemble mean is bounded by the 1-σ inter-model spread in ocean–atmosphere (blue) and land–atmosphere (green) CO2 fluxes (PgC yr–1) grouped into large latitude bands, and the global. For each flux and each region, the CO2 flux anomalies were obtained by subtracting the long-term mean flux from each inversion and removing the seasonal signal. Grey shaded regions indicate El Niño episodes, and the black bars indicate the cooling period following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, during which the growth rate of CO2 remained low. A positive flux means a larger than normal source of CO2 to the atmosphere (or a smaller CO2 sink).

  caption: Idealised simulations with a simple global carbon cycle model (Cao and Caldeira, 2010b) to illustrate the ‘rebound effect’. Effects of an instantaneous cessation of CO2 emissions in the year 2050 (amber line), one-time removal of the excess of atmospheric CO2 over pre-industrial levels (blue line) and removal of this excess of atmospheric CO2 followed by continued removal of all the CO2 that degasses from the ocean (green line) are shown. For the years 1850–2010 observed atmospheric CO2 concentrations are prescribed and CO2 emissions are calculated from CO2 concentrations and modeled carbon uptake. For the years 2011–2049, CO2 emissions are prescribed following the SRES A2 scenario. Starting from year 2050, CO2 emission is either set to zero or calculated from modeled CO2 concentrations and CO2 uptake. To a first approximation, a cessation of emissions would prevent further warming but would not lead to significant cooling on the century time scale. A one-time removal of excess atmospheric CO2 would eliminate approximately only half of the warming experienced at the time of the removal because of CO2 that outgases from the ocean (the rebound effect). To bring atmospheric CO2 back to pre-industrial levels permanently, would require the removal of all previously emitted CO2, that is, an amount equivalent to approximately twice the excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-industrial level.

  caption: Schematic of the global cycle of CH4. Numbers represent annual fluxes in Tg(CH4) yr–1 estimated for the time period 2000–2009 and CH4 reservoirs in Tg (CH4): the atmosphere and three geological reservoirs (hydrates on land and in the ocean floor and gas reserves) (see Section 6.3.3). Black arrows denote ‘natural’ fluxes, that is, fluxes that are not directly caused by human activities since 1750, red arrows anthropogenic fluxes, and the light brown arrow denotes a combined natural + anthropogenic flux. Note that human activities (e.g., land use) may have modified indirectly the global magnitude of the natural fluxes (Section 6.3.3). Ranges represent minimum and maximum values from cited references as given in Table 6.8 in Section 6.3.3. Gas reserves are from GEA (2006) and are consistent with numbers used by IPCC WG III for future scenarios. Hydrate reservoir sizes are from Archer et al. (2007). The atmospheric inventories have been calculated using a conversion factor of 2.7476 TgCH4 per ppb (Prather et al., 2012). The assumed preindustrial annual mean globally averaged CH4 concentration was 722 ± 25 ppb taking the average of the Antarctic Law Dome ice core observations (MacFarling-Meure et al., 2006) and the measurements from the GRIP ice core in Greenland (Blunier et al., 1995; see also Table 2.1). The atmospheric inventory in the year 2011 is based on an annual globally averaged CH4 concentration of 1803 ± 4 ppb in the year 2011 (see Table 2.1). It is the sum of the atmospheric increase between 1750 and 2011 (in red) and of the pre-industrial inventory (in black). The average atmospheric increase each year, also called growth rate, is based on a measured concentration increase of 2.2 ppb yr–1 during the time period 2000–2009 (Dlugokencky et al., 2011).

  caption: Simplified schematic of the global carbon cycle. Numbers represent reservoir mass, also called ‘carbon stocks’ in PgC (1 PgC = 1015 gC) and annual carbon exchange fluxes (in PgC yr–1). Black numbers and arrows indicate reservoir mass and exchange fluxes estimated for the time prior to the Industrial Era, about 1750 (see Section 6.1.1.1 for references). Fossil fuel reserves are from GEA (2006) and are consistent with numbers used by IPCC WGIII for future scenarios. The sediment storage is a sum of 150 PgC of the organic carbon in the mixed layer (Emerson and Hedges, 1988) and 1600 PgC of the deep-sea CaCO3 sediments available to neutralize fossil fuel CO2 (Archer et al., 1998). Red arrows and numbers indicate annual ‘anthropogenic’ fluxes averaged over the 2000–2009 time period. These fluxes are a perturbation of the carbon cycle during Industrial Era post 1750. These fluxes (red arrows) are: Fossil fuel and cement emissions of CO2 (Section 6.3.1), Net land use change (Section 6.3.2), and the Average atmospheric increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, also called ‘CO2 growth rate’ (Section 6.3). The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean and by terrestrial ecosystems, often called ‘carbon sinks’ are the red arrows part of Net land flux and Net ocean flux. Red numbers in the reservoirs denote cumulative changes of anthropogenic carbon over the Industrial Period 1750–2011 (column 2 in Table 6.1). By convention, a positive cumulative change means that a reservoir has gained carbon since 1750. The cumulative change of anthropogenic carbon in the terrestrial reservoir is the sum of carbon cumulatively lost through land use change and carbon accumulated since 1750 in other ecosystems (Table 6.1). Note that the mass balance of the two ocean carbon stocks Surface ocean and Intermediate and deep ocean includes a yearly accumulation of anthropogenic carbon (not shown). Uncertainties are reported as 90% confidence intervals. Emission estimates and land and ocean sinks (in red) are from Table 6.1 in Section 6.3. The change of gross terrestrial fluxes (red arrows of Gross photosynthesis and Total respiration and fires) has been estimated from CMIP5 model results (Section 6.4). The change in air–sea exchange fluxes (red arrows of ocean atmosphere gas exchange) have been estimated from the difference in atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 since 1750 (Sarmiento and Gruber, 2006). Individual gross fluxes and their changes since the beginning of the Industrial Era have typical uncertainties of more than 20%, while their differences (Net land flux and Net ocean flux in the figure) are determined from independent measurements with a much higher accuracy (see Section 6.3). Therefore, to achieve an overall balance, the values of the more uncertain gross fluxes have been adjusted so that their difference matches the Net land flux and Net ocean flux estimates. Fluxes from volcanic eruptions, rock weathering (silicates and carbonates weathering reactions resulting into a small uptake of atmospheric CO2), export of carbon from soils to rivers, burial of carbon in freshwater lakes and reservoirs and transport of carbon by rivers to the ocean are all assumed to be pre-industrial fluxes, that is, unchanged during 1750–2011. Some recent studies (Section 6.3) indicate that this assumption is likely not verified, but global estimates of the Industrial Era perturbation of all these fluxes was not available from peer-reviewed literature. The atmospheric inventories have been calculated using a conversion factor of 2.12 PgC per ppm (Prather et al., 2012).

Text at the top of the panels indicates the dominant processes that remove the excess of CO2 emitted in the atmosphere on the successive time scales. Note that higher pulse of CO2 emissions leads to higher remaining CO2 fraction (Section 6.3.2.4) due to reduced carbonate buffer capacity of the ocean and positive climate–carbon cycle feedback (Section 6.3.2.6.6).

This value falls within literature estimates (Volk et al., 1997). The atmospheric inventories have been calculated using a conversion factor of 4.79 TgN (N2O) per ppb (Prather et al., 2012).

  caption: The response of interannual land CO2 flux anomaly to per 1°C interannual temperature anomaly and per 100 mm interannual precipitation anomaly during 1980–2009. Black circles show climate sensitivity of land CO2 sink estimated from the residual land sink (see Figure 6.15 and Table 6.1), which is the sum of fossil fuel and cement emissions and land use change emissions minus the sum of observed atmospheric CO2 growth rate and modeled ocean sink sink (Le Quéré et al., 2009; Friedlingstein and Prentice, 2010). Coloured circles show land CO2 sink estimated by 10 process-based terrestrial carbon cycle models (CLM4C (Community Land Model for Carbon), CLM4CN (Community Land Model for Carbon–Nitrogen), HYLAND (HYbrid LAND terrestrial ecosystem model), LPJ (Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model), LPJ–GUESS (LPJ–General Ecosystem Simulator, OCN (Cycling of Carbon and Nitrogen on land, derived from ORCHIDEE model), ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms model), SDGVM (Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model), TRIFFID (Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics) and VEGAS (terrestrial vegetation and carbon model)). Error bars show standard error of the sensitivity estimates. Dashed error bars indicate the estimated sensitivity by the regression approach is statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). Grey area denoted the area bounded by the estimated climate sensitivity of the residual land sink ± the standard error of the estimated climate sensitivity of the residual land sink. The sensitivity of land CO2 sink interannual variations to interannual variations of temperature (or precipitation) is estimated as the regression coefficient of temperature (or precipitation) in a multiple regression of detrended anomaly of land CO2 sink against detrended anomaly of annual mean temperature and annual precipitation.

There is an emission of 1000 PgC in the reference case (black line) between 1800 and 2100, corresponding approximately to RCP4.5 scenario (Section 6.4). Permanent sequestration of 380 PgC, assuming no leakage of sequestered carbon would reduce climate change (blue line, compared to black line). By contrast, a non-permanent sequestration CDR method where carbon will be sequestered and later on returned to the atmosphere in three centuries would not. In this idealised non-permanent sequestration example scenario, climate change would only be delayed but the eventual magnitude of climate change will be equivalent to the no-sequestration case (green line, compared to black).

  caption: Model and simulation strategy for representing the climate system and climate processes at different space and time scales. Also shown are the ranges of space and time scales usually associated with cloud processes (orange, lower left) and the climate system (blue, upper right). Classes of models are usually defined based on the range of spatial scales they represent, which in the figure is roughly spanned by the text for each model class. The temporal scales simulated by a particular type of model vary more widely. For instance, climate models are often run for a few time steps for diagnostic studies, or can simulate millennia. Hence the figure indicates the typical time scales for which a given model is used. Computational power prevents one model from covering all time and space scales. Since the AR4, the development of Global Cloud Resolving Models (GCRMs), and hybrid approaches such as General Circulation Models (GCMs) using the ‘super-parameterization’ approach (sometimes called the Multiscale Modelling Framework (MMF)), have helped fill the gap between climate system and cloud process models.

At left is shown the total radiative response including the Planck response. In the darker shaded region is shown the traditional breakdown of this into a Planck response and individual feedbacks from water vapour (labelled ‘WVMR’) and lapse rate (labelled ‘Lapse’). In the lighter-shaded region at right are the equivalent three parameters calculated in an alternative, relative humidity-based framework. In this framework all three components are both weaker and more consistent among the models. (Data are from Held and Shell, 2012.)

  caption: Schematic depicting the myriad aerosol–cloud–precipitation related processes occurring within a typical GCM grid box. The schematic conveys the importance of considering aerosol–cloud–precipitation processes as part of an interactive system encompassing a large range of spatiotemporal scales. Cloud types include low-level stratocumulus and cumulus where research focuses on aerosol activation, mixing between cloudy and environmental air, droplet coalescence and scavenging which results in cloud processing of aerosol particles, and new particle production near clouds; cirrus clouds where a key issue is ice nucleation through homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing; and deep convective clouds where some of the key questions relate to aerosol influences on liquid, ice, and liquid–ice pathways for precipitation formation, cold pool formation and scavenging. These processes influence the shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effect and hence climate. Primary processes that affect aerosol–cloud interactions are labelled in blue while secondary processes that result from and influence aerosol–cloud interactions are in grey.

  caption: Overview of some proposed geoengineering methods as they have been suggested. Carbon Dioxide Removal methods (see Section 6.5 for details): (A) nutrients are added to the ocean (ocean fertilization), which increases oceanic productivity in the surface ocean and transports a fraction of the resulting biogenic carbon downward; (B) alkalinity from solid minerals is added to the ocean, which causes more atmospheric CO2 to dissolve in the ocean; (C) the weathering rate of silicate rocks is increased, and the dissolved carbonate minerals are transported to the ocean; (D) atmospheric CO2 is captured chemically, and stored either underground or in the ocean; (E) biomass is burned at an electric power plant with carbon capture, and the captured CO2 is stored either underground or in the ocean; and (F) CO2 is captured through afforestation and reforestation to be stored in land ecosystems. Solar Radiation Management methods (see Section 7.7 for details): (G) reflectors are placed in space to reflect solar radiation; (H) aerosols are injected in the stratosphere; (I) marine clouds are seeded in order to be made more reflective; (J) 7 microbubbles are produced at the ocean surface to make it more reflective; (K) more reflective crops are grown; and (L) roofs and other built structures are whitened.

The tropopause and melting level are shown by the thick solid and thin grey dashed lines, respectively. Changes anticipated in a warmer climate are shown by arrows, with red colour indicating those making a robust positive feedback contribution and grey indicating those where the feedback contribution is small and/or highly uncertain. No robust mechanisms contribute negative feedback. Changes include rising high cloud tops and melting level, and increased polar cloud cover and/or optical thickness (high confidence); broadening of the Hadley Cell and/or poleward migration of storm tracks, and narrowing of rainfall zones such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (medium confidence); and reduced low-cloud amount and/or optical thickness (low confidence). Confidence assessments are based on degree of GCM consensus, strength of independent lines of evidence from observations or process models and degree of basic understanding.

The density of the sites is a qualitative measure of the spatial representativeness of the values for each area. The North Atlantic and Indian Oceans panels correspond to measurements from single sites (Mace Head and Amsterdam Island, respectively) that are not necessarily representative. The relative abundances of different aerosol compounds are considered to reflect the relative importance of emissions of these compounds or their precursors, either anthropogenic or natural, in the different areas. For consistency the mass of organic aerosol (OA) has been converted to that of organic carbon (OC), according to a conversion factor (typically 1.4 to 1.6), as provided in each study.

  caption: Illustration of the response of the large-scale atmospheric overturning to warming (adapted from Bony et al., 2013). The overturning intensity is shown on the y-axis and is measured by the difference between the mean motion in upward moving air and the mean motion in downward moving air. The warming is shown on the x-axis and is measured by the change in surface temperature averaged over the Tropics, ΔTs, after an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2. The grey region delineates responses for which ΔTs is zero by definition. Nearly one half of the final reduction in the intensity of the overturning is evident before any warming is felt, and can be associated with a rapid adjustment of the hydrological cycle to changes in the atmospheric cooling rate accompanying a change in CO2. With warming the circulation intensity is further reduced. The rapid adjustment, as measured by the change in circulation intensity for zero warming, is different over land and ocean. Over land the increase in CO2 initially causes an intensification of the circulation. The result is robust in the sense that it is apparent in all of the 15 CMIP5 models analysed, irrespective of the details of their configuration.

Feedback loops, which are ultimately rooted in changes ensuing from changes in the surface temperature, are represented by curving arrows (blue denotes cloud feedbacks; green denotes aerosol feedbacks; and orange denotes other feedback loops such as those involving the lapse rate, water vapour and surface albedo).

For low clouds, the GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product (GOCCP) data set for 2007–2010 (Chepfer et al., 2010) is used at locations where it indicates a larger fractional cloud cover, because the GEOPROF data set removes some clouds with tops at altitudes below 750 m. Low cloud amounts are probably underrepresented in regions of high cloud (Chepfer et al., 2008), although not as severely as with earlier satellite instruments.

(a) A visible-wavelength geostationary satellite image shows (from top to bottom) expanses and long arcs of cloud associated with extratropical cyclones, subtropical coastal stratocumulus near Baja California breaking up into shallow cumulus clouds in the central Pacific and mesoscale convective systems outlining the Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). (b) A schematic section along the dashed line from the orange star to the orange circle in (a), through a typical warm front of an extratropical cyclone. It shows (from right to left) multiple layers of upper-tropospheric ice (cirrus) and mid-tropospheric water (altostratus) cloud in the upper-tropospheric outflow from the frontal zone, an extensive region of nimbostratus associated with frontal uplift and turbulence-driven boundary layer cloud in the warm sector. (c) A schematic section along the dashed line from the red star to the red circle in (a), along the low-level trade wind flow from a subtropical west coast of a continent to the ITCZ. It shows (from right to left) typical low-latitude cloud mixtures, shallow stratocumulus trapped under a strong subsidence inversion above the cool waters of the oceanic upwelling zone near the coast and shallow cumulus over warmer waters further offshore transitioning to precipitating cumulonimbus cloud systems with extensive cirrus anvils associated with rising air motions in the ITCZ.

The ‘original’ values are calculated based on the methods explained or value reported in each IPCC Assessment Report. The ‘updated’ values are calculated based on the methods used in AR5, but the input values from each Assessment Report. The difference is primarily in the formula for the RE, which was updated in TAR. The different integrated IRF in TAR relates to a different parameterisation of the same IRF (WMO, 1999). Changes represent both changes in scientific understanding and a changing background atmospheric CO2 concentration (note that y-axis starts from 0.8). The lines connecting individual points are meant as a visual guide and not to represent the values between different Assessment Reports.

Note that a certain part of CH4 attribution is not straightforward and discussed further in Section 8.3.3. Red (positive RF) and blue (negative forcing) are used for emitted components which affect few forcing agents, whereas for emitted components affecting many compounds several colours are used as indicated in the inset at the upper part the figure. The vertical bars indicate the relative uncertainty of the RF induced by each component. Their length is proportional to the thickness of the bar, that is, the full length is equal to the bar thickness for a ±50% uncertainty. The net impact of the individual contributions is shown by a diamond symbol and its uncertainty (5 to 95% confidence range) is given by the horizontal error bar. ERFaci is ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction. BC and OC are co-emitted, especially for biomass burning emissions (given as Biomass Burning in the figure) and to a large extent also for fossil and biofuel emissions (given as Fossil and Biofuel in the figure where biofuel refers to solid biomass fuels).

  caption: Probability density function (PDF) of ERF due to total GHG, aerosol forcing and total anthropogenic forcing. The GHG consists of WMGHG, ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The PDFs are generated based on uncertainties provided in Table 8.6. The combination of the individual RF agents to derive total forcing over the Industrial Era are done by Monte Carlo simulations and based on the method in Boucher and Haywood (2001). PDF of the ERF from surface albedo changes and combined contrails and contrail-induced cirrus are included in the total anthropogenic forcing, but not shown as a separate PDF. We currently do not have ERF estimates for some forcing mechanisms: ozone, land use, solar, etc. For these forcings we assume that the RF is representative of the ERF and for the ERF uncertainty an additional uncertainty of 17% has been included in quadrature to the RF uncertainty. See Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.7 and Table 8.SM.4 for further description on method and values used in the calculations. Lines at the top of the figure compare the best estimates and uncertainty ranges (5 to 95% confidence range) with RF estimates from AR4.

  caption: (a) The Absolute Global Warming Potential (AGWP) is calculated by integrating the RF due to emission pulses over a chosen time horizon; for example, 20 and 100 years (vertical lines). The GWP is the ratio of AGWP for component i over AGWP for the reference gas CO2. The blue hatched field represents the integrated RF from a pulse of CO2, while the green and red fields represent example gases with 1.5 and 13 years lifetimes, respectively. (b) The Global Temperature change Potential (GTP) is based on the temperature response at a selected year after pulse emission of the same gases; e.g., 20 or 100 years (vertical lines). See Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.11 for equations for calculations of GWP and GTP.

  caption: Confidence level of the forcing mechanisms in the 4 last IPCC assessments. In the previous IPCC assessments the level of scientific understanding (LOSU) has been adopted instead of confidence level, but for comparison with previous IPCC assessments the LOSU is converted approximately to confidence level. The thickness of the bars represents the relative magnitude of the current forcing (with a minimum value for clarity of presentation). LOSU for the RF mechanisms was not available in the first IPCC Assessment (Houghton et al., 1990). Rapid adjustments associated with aerosol–cloud interactions (shown as RA aero. –cloud interac.) which include what was previously referred to as the second indirect aerosol effect or cloud lifetime effect whereas rapid adjustments associated with aerosol–radiation interactions (shown as RA aero.-rad. interac.) were previously referred to as the semi-direct effect (see Figure 7.3). In AR4 the confidence level for aerosol–cloud interaction was given both for RF due to aerosol–cloud interaction and rapid adjustment associated with aerosol–cloud interaction. Generally the aerosol–cloud interaction is not separated into various components in AR5, hence the confidence levels for ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction in AR5 and for RF due to aerosol–cloud interaction from previous IPCC reports are compared. The confidence level for the rapid adjustment associated with aerosol–cloud interaction is comparable for AR4 and AR5. The colours are adopted based on the evidence and agreement shown in Figure 1.11. Dark green is “High agreement and Robust evidence”, light green is either “High agreement and Medium evidence” or “Medium agreement and Robust evidence”, yellow is either “High agreement and limited evidence” or “Medium agreement and Medium evidence” or “Low agreement and Robust evidence”, orange is either “Medium agreement and Limited evidence” or “Low agreement and Medium evidence” and finally red is “Low agreement and Limited evidence”.

Because of the integrative nature the AGWP for CH4 (yellow curve) reaches a constant level after about five decades. The AGWP for CO2 continues to increase for centuries. Thus the ratio which is the GWP (black curve) falls with increasing time horizon.

  caption: Relative error measures of CMIP5 model performance, based on the global seasonal-cycle climatology (1980–2005) computed from the historical experiments. Rows and columns represent individual variables and models, respectively. The error measure is a space–time root-mean-square error (RMSE), which, treating each variable separately, is portrayed as a relative error by normalizing the result by the median error of all model results (Gleckler et al., 2008). For example, a value of 0.20 indicates that a model’s RMSE is 20% larger than the median CMIP5 error for that variable, whereas a value of –0.20 means the error is 20% smaller than the median error. No colour (white) indicates that model results are currently unavailable. A diagonal split of a grid square shows the relative error with respect to both the default reference data set (upper left triangle) and the alternate (lower right triangle). The relative errors are calculated independently for the default and alternate data sets. All reference data used in the diagram are summarized in Table 9.3.

Results are shown for individual CMIP3 (black) and CMIP5 (blue) models as thin dashes, along with the corresponding ensemble average (thick dash) and median (open circle). The four variables shown are surface air temperature (TAS), top of the atmosphere (TOA) outgoing longwave radiation (RLUT), precipitation (PR) and TOA shortwave cloud radiative effect (SW CRE). The observations used for each variable are the default products and climatological periods identified in Table 9.3. The correlations between the default and alternate (Table 9.3) observations are also shown (solid green circles). To ensure a fair comparison across a range of model resolutions, the pattern correlations are computed at a resolution of 4o in longitude and 5o in latitude. Only one realization is used from each model from the CMIP3 20C3M and CMIP5 historical simulations.

The observed climatological values are sourced from the World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA09; Prepared by the Ocean Climate Laboratory, National Oceanographic Data Center, Silver Spring, MD, USA), and are shown as labelled black contours. White contours show regions in (a) where potential temperature differences exceed positive or negative 1, 2 or 3°C, and in (b) where salinity differences exceed positive or negative 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1 (PSS-78). The simulated annual mean climatologies are obtained for 1975 to 2005 from available historical simulations, whereas WOA09 synthesizes observed data from 1874 to 2008 in calculations of the annual mean; however, the median time for gridded observations most closely resembles the 1980–2010 period (Durack and Wijffels, 2012). Multiple realizations from individual models are first averaged to form a single-model climatology, before the construction of the multi-model ensemble mean. A total of 43 available CMIP5 models have contributed to the temperature panel (a) and 41 models to the salinity panel (b).

Model output is compared to the Bartlein et al. (2010) data set over land, including ice core data over Greenland and Antarctica (Braconnot et al., 2012) and the Margo data set (Waelbroeck et al., 2009) over the ocean. The CMIP5/Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project version 3 (PMIP3) ensemble of Ocean–Atmosphere (OA) and Earth System Model (ESM) simulations are compared to the respective PMIP2 ensembles in the first four columns of each panel. A diagonal divides each cell in two parts to show in the upper triangle a measure of the distance between model and data, taking into account the uncertainties in the palaeoclimate reconstructions (Guiot et al., 1999), and in the lower triangle the normalized mean-square error (NMSE) that indicates how well the spatial pattern is represented. In this graph all the values have been normalized following (Gleckler et al., 2008) using the median of the CMIP5/PMIP3 ensemble. The colour scale is such that blue colours mean that the result is better than the median CMIP5 model and red means that it is worse.

Individual CMIP5 models with interactive or semi-interactive chemistry are shown in thin coloured lines, their multi-model mean (CMIP5Chem) in thick red and their standard deviation as the blue shaded area. Further shown are the multi-model mean of the CMIP5 models that prescribe ozone (CMIP5noChem, thick green), the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry/Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (IGAC/SPARC) ozone database (thick pink), the Chemistry Climate Model Validation-2 (CCMVal-2) multimodel mean (thick orange), and observations from five different sources (black symbols). These sources include ground-based measurements (updated from Fioletov et al., 2002), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer/Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet(/2) (TOMS/OMI/SBUV(/2)) merged satellite data (Stolarski and Frith, 2006), the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) combined total column ozone database (Bodeker et al., 2005), Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV, SBUV/2) retrievals (updated from Miller et al. 2002), and Deutsches Zentrum für Luftund Raumfahrt/ Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment/ SCanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography /GOME-2 (DLR GOME/SCIA/GOME-2; Loyola et al., 2009; Loyola and Coldewey-Egbers, 2012). Note that the IGAC/SPARC database over Antarctica (and thus the majority of the CMIP5noChem models) is based on ozonesonde measurements at the vortex edge (69°S) and as a result underestimates Antarctic ozone depletion compared to the observations shown. Ozone depletion was more pronounced after 1960 as equivalent stratospheric chlorine values steadily increased throughout the stratosphere. (Adapted from Figure 2 of Eyring et al., 2013.)

Box plots for reconstructions provide the range of reconstructed values for the region. For models, the individual model average over the region is plotted for PMIP2 (small grey circle) and CMIP5/PMIP3 simulations (coloured circles). Note that in PMIP2, ‘ESM’ indicates that vegetation is computed using a dynamical vegetation model, whereas in CMIP5/PMIP3 it indicates that models have an interactive carbon cycle with different complexity in dynamical vegetation (see Table 9.A.1).

The azimuthal variable shows the correlation of the modelled spatial pattern with the observed spatial pattern. The root-mean square error with bias removed is indicated by the dashed grey circles about the observational point. Analysis is for the global ocean, 50°S to 50°N. The reference data set is Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO), a merged satellite product (Ducet et al., 2000), which is described in Chapter 3. One realization per model is shown for each CMIP5 and CMIP3 model result. Grey filled circles are for individual CMIP3 models; other symbols as in legend.

  caption: Time series of simulated and observed global ocean heat content anomalies (with respect to 1971). CMIP5 historical simulations and observations for both the upper 700 meters of the ocean (a) as well as for the total ocean heat content (b). Total ocean heat content results are also shown for EMICs and observations (c). EMIC estimates are based on time-integrated surface heat flux into the ocean. The 0 to 700 m and total heat content observational estimates (thick lines) are respectively described in Figure 3.2 and Box 3.1, Figure 1. Simulation drift has been removed from all CMIP5 runs with a contemporaneous portion of a quadratic fit to each corresponding pre-industrial control run (Gleckler et al., 2012). Units are 1022 Joules.

These measures are based on the seasonal range of precipitation using hemispheric summer (May through September in the Northern Hemisphere (NH)) minus winter (November through March in the NH) values. The monsoon precipitation domain is defined where the annual range is >2.5 mm day–1, and the monsoon precipitation intensity is the seasonal range divided by the annual mean. The threat scores (Wilks, 1995) indicate how well the models represent the monsoon precipitation domain compared to the GPCP data. The threat score in panel (a) is between GPCP and CMAP rainfall to indicate observational uncertainty, whereas in the other panel it is between the simulations and the GPCP observational data set. A threat score of 1.0 would indicate perfect agreement between the two data sets. See Wang and Ding (2008),Wang et al. (2011a), and Kim et al. (2011) for details of the calculations.

The confidence limits on the ensemble mean are derived by assuming that the CMIP5 models come from a t-distribution. The grey areas show the range of annual mean fluxes simulated across the model ensemble. This figure includes results from all CMIP5 models that reported land CO2 fluxes, ocean CO2 fluxes, or both (Anav et al., 2013).

(b) Power spectral density for 1901–2010 global mean surface temperature for both historical CMIP5 simulations and the observations (after Jones et al., 2012). The grey shading provides the 5 to 95% range of the simulations. (c) Power spectral density for Northern Hemisphere surface temperature from the CMIP5/ Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project version 3 (PMIP3) last-millennium simulations (colour, solid) using common external forcing configurations (Schmidt et al., 2012), together with the corresponding pre-industrial simulations (colour, dashed), previous last-millennium AOGCM simulations (black: Fernandez-Donado et al., 2013), and temperature reconstructions from different proxy records (see Section 5.3.5). For comparison between model results and proxy records, the spectra in (c) have been computed from normalized Northern Hemisphere time series. The small panel included in the bottom panel shows for the different models and reconstructions the percentage of spectral density cumulated for periods longer than 50 years, to highlight the differences between unforced (pre-industrial control) and forced (PMIP3 and pre-PMIP3) simulations, compared to temperature reconstruction for the longer time scales. In (b) and (c) the spectra have been computed using a Tukey–Hanning filter of width 97 and 100 years, respectively. The model outputs were not detrended, except for the MIROC-ESM millennium simulation. The 5 to 95% intervals (vertical lines) provide the accuracy of the power spectra estimated given a typical length of 110 years for (b) and 1150 years for (c).

For each 1° × 1° longitude-latitude grid cell, the figure indicates the number of models that simulate at least 5 kg m–2 of snow-water equivalent. The observations-based boundaries (red line) mark the territory with at least 20% of the days per month with snow cover (Robinson and Frei, 2000) over the period 1986–2005. The annual mean 0°C isotherm at 3.3 m depth averaged across 24 CMIP5 models (yellow line) is a proxy for the near-surface permafrost boundary. Observed permafrost extent in the NH (magenta line) is based on Brown et al. (1997, 1998).

The 20to 100-day filtered OLR from observations and each of the CMIP5 historical simulations and the CMIP3 simulations of 20th century climate is projected on these two leading EOFs to obtain MJO Principal Component time series. The scatterplot (c) shows the maximum positive correlation between the resulting MJO Principal Components and the time lag at which it occurred for all winters (November to March). The maximum positive correlation is an indication of the coherence with which the MJO convection propagates from the Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent/western Pacific, and the time lag is approximately one fourth of the period of the MJO.

The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble mean (thick red line) is based on 37 CMIP5 models (historical simulations extended after 2005 with RCP4.5 projections). Each model is represented with a single simulation. The dotted black line for the Arctic in (a) relates to the pre-satellite period of observation-based time series (Stroeve et al., 2012). In (a) and (b) the panels on the right are based on the corresponding 37-member ensemble means from CMIP5 (thick red lines) and 12-model ensemble means from CMIP3 (thick blue lines). The CMIP3 12-model means are based on CMIP3 historical simulations extended after 1999 with Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 projections. The pink and light blue shadings denote the 5 to 95 percentile range for the corresponding ensembles. Note that these are monthly means, not yearly minima. (Adapted from Pavlova et al., 2011.)

In PMIP2, only Community Climate System Model (CCSM) included a 1 psu adjustment of ocean salinity at initialization to account for freshwater frozen into LGM ice sheets; the other PMIP2 model-simulated salinities have been adjusted to allow a comparison. In PMIP3, all simulations include the 1 psu adjustment as required in the PMIP2/CMIP5 protocol (Braconnot et al., 2012). The dotted lines allow a comparison of the values at the NH and SH sites for a same model. This figure is adapted from Otto-Bliesner et al. (2007).

(2013). In (a), reddish and bluish colours indicate, respectively, larger and smaller root-mean-square (RMS) errors for an individual model relative to the median model. The relative error is calculated for each observational data set separately. The grey-shaded columns on the right side indicate the RMS error for the multi-model median standardized by the spatial standard deviation of the index climatology in the reanalysis, representing absolute errors for CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. Results for four different reference data sets, ERA-interim (top), ERA40 (left), NCEP/NCAR (right) and NCEPDepartment of Energy (DOE) (bottom) reanalyses, are shown in each box. The analysis period is 1981–2000, and only land areas are considered. The indices shown are simple daily precipitation intensity index (SDII), very wet days (R95p), annual maximum 5-day/1-day precipitation (RX5day/ RX1day), consecutive dry days (CDD), tropical nights (TR), frost days (FD), annual minimum/maximum daily maximum surface air temperature (TXn/TXx), and annual minimum/ maximum daily minimum surface air temperature (TNn/TNx). See Box 2.4 for the definitions of indices. Note that only a small selection of the indices analysed in Sillmann et al. (2013) is shown, preferentially those that appear in Chapters 2, 10, 11, 12, 14. Also note that the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis has a known defect for TXx (Sillmann et al., 2013), but its impact on this figure is small. In (b)–(e), shading for model results indicates the 25th to 75th quantile range of inter-model spread. Grey shading along the horizontal axis indicates the evolution of globally averaged volcanic forcing according to Sato et al. (1993). The indices shown are the frequency of daily minimum/maximum surface air temperature below the 10th percentile (b: Cold nights/c: Cold days) and that above 90th percentile (d: Warm nights/e: Warm days) of the 1961–1990 base period. Note that, as these indices essentially represent changes relative to the base period, they are particularly suitable for being shown in time series and not straightforward for being shown in (a).

The colour coding indicates changes since CMIP3 (or models of that generation) to CMIP5. The assessment of model performance is expert judgment based on the agreement with observations of the multi-model mean and distribution of individual models around the mean, taking into account internal climate variability.

Following the CMIP5 protocol (Taylor et al., 2012b), all simulations use specified historical forcings up to and including 2005 and use RCP4.5 after 2005 (see Figure 10.1 and note different reference period used there; results will differ slightly when using alternative RCP scenarios for the post-2005 period). (a) Inset: the global mean surface temperature for the reference period 1961–1990, for each individual model (colours), the CMIP5 multi-model mean (thick red), and the observations (thick black: Jones et al., 1999). (Bottom) Single simulations from available EMIC simulations (thin lines), from Eby et al. (2013). Observational data are the same as in (a). All EMIC simulations ended in 2005 and use the CMIP5 historical forcing scenario. (b) Inset: Same as in (a) but for the EMICs.

(2013), following Soden et al. (2008). CMIP5 feedbacks are derived from CMIP5 simulations for abrupt fourfold increases in CO2 concentrations (4 × CO2). (b) ECS obtained using regression techniques by Andrews et al. (2012) against ECS estimated from the ratio of CO2 ERF to the sum of all feedbacks. The CO2 ERF is one-half the 4 × CO2 forcings from Andrews et al. (2012), and the total feedback (ALL + Planck) is from Vial et al. (2013).

Reanalysis data sets (see also Box 2.3) are marked with different colours. Trends are all calculated over the period of 1979– 2005. The terms historicalNAT, historicalGHG, and historical denote CMIP5 simulations with natural forcing, with greenhouse gas forcing and with both anthropogenic and natural forcings, respectively. For each reanalysis data set, the error bars indicate the 95% confidence level of the standard t-test. For CMIP5 simulations, trends are first calculated for each model, and all ensemble members of simulations are used. Then, trends are averaged for multi-model ensembles. Trend uncertainty is estimated from multi-model ensembles, as twice the standard error. (Updated from Hu et al., 2013.)

  caption: Detection results for changes in intensity and frequency of extreme events. The left side of each panel shows scaling factors and their 90% confidence intervals for intensity of annual extreme temperatures in response to external forcings for the period 1951–2000. TNn and TXn represent coldest daily minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively, while TNx and TXx represent warmest daily minimum and maximum temperatures (updated from Zwiers et al., 2011). Fingerprints are based on simulations of climate models with both anthropogenic and natural forcings. Right-hand sides of each panel show scaling factors and their 90% confidence intervals for changes in the frequency of temperature extremes for winter (October to March for the Northern Hemisphere and April to September for the Southern Hemisphere), and summer half years. TN10p, TX10p are respectively the frequency of cold nights and days (daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures falling below their 10th percentiles for the base period 1961–1990). TN90p and TX90p are the frequency of warm nights and days (daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures above their respective 90th percentiles calculated for the 1961–1990 base period (Morak et al., 2013) with fingerprints based on simulations of Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 1 (HadGEM1) with both anthropogenic and natural forcings. Detection is claimed at the 5% significance level if the 90% confidence interval of a scaling factor is entirely above the zero line. Grey represents regions with insufficient data.

  caption: Time series of projected temperature change shown at four representative locations for summer (red curves, representing June, July and August at sites in the tropics and Northern Hemisphere or December, January and February in the Southern Hemisphere) and winter (blue curves). Each time series is surrounded by an envelope of projected changes (pink for the local warm season, blue for the local cold season) yielded by 24 different model simulations, emerging from a grey envelope of natural local variability simulated by the models using early 20th century conditions. The warming signal emerges first in the tropics during summer. The central map shows the global temperature increase (°C) needed for temperatures in summer at individual locations to emerge from the envelope of early 20th century variability. Note that warm colours denote the smallest needed temperature increase, hence earliest time of emergence. All calculations are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate model simulations forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emissions scenario. Envelopes of projected change and natural variability are defined as ±2 standard deviations. (Adapted and updated from Mahlstein et al., 2011.)

Grey shading shows observational uncertainty. The global mean stratospheric optical depth (Sato et al., 1993) in beige at the bottom indicates the major volcanic eruptions and the brown curve is a 3-year running average of these values. (B) Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio (plotted as a function of increasing trend length L) of basin-scale changes in volume averaged temperature of newer, expendable bathythermograph (XBT)-corrected data (solid red, purple and blue lines), older, uncorrected data (dashed red and blue lines); the average of the three corrected observational sets (AveObs; dashed cyan line); and simulations that include volcanic (V) or exclude volcanic eruptions (NoV) (black solid and grey dashed lines respectively). The start date for the calculation of signal trends is 1970 and the initial trend length is 10 years. The 1% and 5% significance thresholds are shown (as horizontal grey lines) and assume a Gaussian distribution of noise trends in the V-models control-run pseudo-principal components. The detection time is defined as the year at which S/N exceeds and remains above 1% or 5% significance threshold (Gleckler et al., 2012).

  caption: The top panel compares the mean annual Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface air temperature from a multi-model ensemble to several NH temperature reconstructions. These reconstructions are: CH-blend from Hegerl et al. (2007a) in purple, which is a reconstruction of 30°N to 90°N land only (Mann et al., 2009), plotted for the region 30°N to 90°N land and sea (green) and D’Arrigo et al. (2006) in red, which is a reconstruction of 20°N to 90°N land only. The dotted coloured lines show the corresponding instrumental data. The multi-model mean for the reconstructed domain is scaled to fit each reconstruction in turn, using a total least squares (TLS) method. The best estimate of the detected forced signal is shown in orange (as an individual line for each reconstruction; lines overlap closely) with light orange shading indicating the range expected if accounting for internal variability. The best fit scaling values for each reconstruction are given in the insert as well as the detection results for six other reconstructions (M8; M9 (Mann et al., 2008, 2009); AW (Ammann and Wahl, 2007); Mo (Moberg et al., 2005); Ju (Juckes et al., 2007); CH (Hegerl et al., 2007a); CL (Christiansen and Ljungqvist, 2011) and inverse regressed onto the instrumental record CS; DA (D’Arrigo et al., 2006); Fr (Frank et al., 2007). An asterisk next to the reconstruction name indicates that the residuals (over the more robustly reconstructed period 1401–1950) are inconsistent with the internal variability generated by the combined control simulations of all climate models investigated (for details see Schurer et al., 2013). The ensemble average of a data-assimilation simulation (Goosse et al., 2012b) is plotted in blue, for the region 30°N to 90°N land and sea, with the error range shown in light blue shading. The bottom panel is similar to the top panel, but showing the European region, following Hegerl et al. (2011a) but using the simulations and method in Schurer et al. (2013). The detection analysis is performed for the period 1500–1950 for two reconstructions: Luterbacher et al. (2004)(representing the region 35°N to 70°N,25°W to 40°E, “land only, labelled ‘Lu’ in the insert”) shown in red, and Mann et al. (2009) (averaged over the region 25°N to 65°N, 0° to 60°E, land and sea, labelled ‘M9’ in the insert), shown in green. As in the top panel, best fit estimates are shown in dark orange with uncertainty range due to internal variability shown in light orange. The data assimilation from Goosse et al. (2012a), constrained by the Mann et al. (2009) reconstruction is shown in blue, with error range in light blue. All data are shown with respect to the mean of the period covered by the white part of the figure (850–1950 for the NH, 1500–1950 for European mean data).

  caption: Detection and attribution signals in some elements of the climate system, at regional scales (top panels) and global scales (bottom four panels). Brown panels are land surface temperature time series, green panels are precipitation time series, blue panels are ocean heat content time series and white panels are sea ice time series. Observations are shown on each panel in black or black and shades of grey. Blue shading is the model time series for natural forcing simulations and pink shading is the combined natural and anthropogenic forcings. The dark blue and dark red lines are the ensemble means from the model simulations. All panels show the 5 to 95% intervals of the natural forcing simulations, and the natural and anthropogenic forcing simulations. For surface temperature the results are from Jones et al. (2013 ) (and Figure 10.1). The observed surface temperature is from Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 4 (HadCRUT4). Observed precipitation is from Zhang et al. (2007) (black line) and CRU TS 3.0 updated (grey line). Three observed records of ocean heat content (OHC) are shown. Sea ice anomalies (rather than absolute values) are plotted and based on models in Figure 10.16. The green horizontal lines indicate quality of the observations and estimates. For land and ocean surface temperatures panels and precipitation panels, solid green lines at bottom of panels indicate where data spatial coverage being examined is above 50% coverage and dashed green lines where coverage is below 50%. For example, data coverage of Antarctica never goes above 50% of the land area of the continent. For ocean heat content and sea ice panels the solid green line is where the coverage of data is good and higher in quality, and the dashed green line is where the data coverage is only adequate. More details of the sources of model simulations and observations are given in the Supplementary Material (10.SM.1).

  caption: (a) Examples of distributions of the transient climate response (TCR, top) and the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, bottom) estimated from observational constraints. Probability density functions (PDFs), and ranges (5 to 95%) for the TCR estimated by different studies (see text). The grey shaded range marks the very likely range of 1°C to 2.5°C for TCR and the grey solid line represents the extremely unlikely <3°C upper bound as assessed in this section. Representative distributions from AR4 shown as dashed lines and open bar. (b) Estimates of ECS are compared to overall assessed likely range (solid grey), with solid line at 1°C and a dashed line at 6°C. The figure compares some selected old estimates used in AR4 (no labels, thin lines; for references see Supplementary Material) with new estimates available since AR4 (labelled, thicker lines). Distributions are shown where available, together with 5 to 95% ranges and median values (circles). Ranges that are assessed as being incomplete are marked by arrows; note that in contrast to the other estimates Schwartz (2012), shows a sampling range and Chylek and Lohmann a 95% range. Estimates are based on changes over the instrumental period (top row); and changes from palaeoclimatic data (2nd row). Studies that combine multiple lines of evidence are shown in the bottom panel. The boxes on the right-hand side indicate limitations and strengths of each line of evidence, for example, if a period has a similar climatic base state, if feedbacks are similar to those operating under CO2 doubling, if the observed change is close to equilibrium, if, between all lines of evidence plotted, uncertainty is accounted for relatively completely, and summarizes the level of scientific understanding of this line of evidence overall. A blue box indicates an overall line of evidence that is well understood, has small uncertainty, or many studies and overall high confidence. Pale yellow indicates medium, and dark red low, confidence (i.e., poorly understood,very few studies, poor agreement, unknown limitations, after Knutti and Hegerl, 2008). Where available, results are shown using several different prior distributions; for example for Aldrin et al. (2012) solid shows the result using a uniform prior in ECS, which is shown as updated to 2010 in dash-dots; dashed: uniform prior in 1/ECS; and in bottom panel, result combining with Hegerl et al. (2006) prior, For Lewis (2013), dashed shows results using the Forest et al. (2006) diagnostic and an objective Bayesian prior, solid a revised diagnostic. For Otto et al. (2013), solid is an estimate using change to 1979–2009, dashed using the change to 2000–2009. Palaeoclimate: Hargreaves et al. (2012) is shown in solid, with dashed showing an update based on PMIP3 simulations (see Chapter 5); For Schmittner et al. (2011), solid is land-and-ocean, dashed land-only, and dash-dotted is ocean-only diagnostic.

Results in each box are averaged over the designated coloured land regions. Continuous coloured lines and shading denote the average and full range of four chemistry–climate models (GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R, and NCAR-CAM3.5 from CMIP5 plus LMDz-ORINCA). Coloured dots and vertical black bars denote the average and full range of the ACCMIP models (CESM-CAM-superfast, CICERO-OsloCTM2, CMAM, EMAC-DLR, GEOSCCM, GFDL-AM3, HadGEM2, MIROC-CHEM, MOCAGE, NCAR-CAM3.5, STOC-HadAM3, UM-CAM) for decadal time slices centred on 2010, 2030, 2050 and 2100. Participation in the decadal slices ranges from 2 to 12 models (see (Lamarque et al., 2013)). Changes are relative to the 1986–2005 reference period for the CMIP5 transient simulations, and relative to the average of the 1980 and 2000 decadal time slices for the ACCMIP ensemble. The average value and model standard deviation for the reference period is shown in the top of each panel for CMIP5 models (left) and ACCMIP models (right). In cases where multiple ensemble members are available from a single model, they are averaged prior to inclusion in the multi-model mean. (Adapted from Fiore et al., 2012.)

Results are shown for the CMIP5 model ensembles (see Annex I for listing of models included) for RCP2.6 (dark blue), RCP4.5 (light blue), RCP6.0 (orange), and RCP8.5 (red) and the CMIP3 model ensemble (22 models) for SRES A1b (black).

Also shown are best estimates for a UNEP scenario (UNEP-ref, grey upward triangles) and one that implements technological controls on methane emissions (UNEP CH4, red downward-pointing triangles) (UNEP and WMO, 2011; Shindell et al., 2012a). Both UNEP scenarios are adjusted to reflect the 1986–2005 reference period. The right-hand floating axis shows increases in global mean surface air temperature relative to the early instrumental period (0.61°C), defined from the difference between 1850–1900 and 1986–2005 in the Hadley Centre/Climate Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set 4 (HadCRUT4) global mean temperature analysis (Chapter 2 and Table AII.1.3). Note that uncertainty remains on how to match the 1986–2005 reference period in observations with that in CMIP5 results. See discussion of Figure 11.25.

Results are reported globally and for the four northern mid-latitude source regions used by the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP, 2010a). Where two vertical bars are shown (CLE, MFR, SRES ), they represent the multimodel standard deviation of the annual mean based on (left bar; SRES includes A2 only) the Atmospheric Composition Change: a European Network (ACCENT)/Photocomp study (Dentener et al., 2006) and (right bar) the parametric HTAP ensemble (Wild et al., 2012; four SRES and RCP scenarios included). Under Global, the leftmost (dashed green) vertical bar denotes the spatial range in climate-only changes from one model (Stevenson et al., 2005) while the green square shows global annual mean climate-only changes in another model (Unger et al., 2006b). Under Europe, the dashed green bar denotes the range of climate-only changes in summer daily maximum O3 in one model (Forkel and Knoche 2006). (Adapted from Figure 3 of Fiore et al., 2012.)

The model-based estimate of the externally forced component Tf (the red line) is the average over the ensemble of simulations. To the extent that the red line correctly estimates the forced component, the difference between the black and red lines is the internally generated component Ti for global mean temperature. An ensemble of forecasts of global annual mean temperature, initialized in 1998, is plotted as thin purple lines and their average, the ensemble mean forecast, as the thick green line. The grey areas along the axis indicate the presence of external forcing associated with volcanoes.

The red bullets in the figure correspond to the number of probability bins (10 in this case) used to estimate forecast probabilities. The size of the bullets represents the number of forecasts in a specific probability category and is a measure of the sharpness (or variance of the forecast probabilities) of the predictions. The blue horizontal and vertical lines indicate the climatological frequency of the event in the observations and the mean forecast probability, respectively. Grey vertical bars indicate the uncertainty in the observed frequency for each probability category estimated at 95% level of confidence with a bootstrap resampling procedure based on 1000 samples. The longer the bars, the more the vertical position of the bullets may change as new hindcasts become available. The black dashed line separates skilful from unskilled regions in the diagram in the Brier skill score sense. The Brier skill score with respect to the climatological forecast is drawn in the top left corner of each panel. (Adapted from Corti et al., 2012.)

The observational time series, Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) GMST and Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) for the AMV, are represented with dark grey (positive anomalies) and light grey (negative anomalies) vertical bars, where a 4-year running mean has been applied for consistency with the time averaging of the predictions. Predicted time series are shown for the CMIP5 Init (solid) and NoInit (dotted) simulations with hindcasts started every 5 years over the period 1960–2005. The lower and upper quartile of the multi-model ensemble are plotted using thin lines. The AMV index was computed as the SST anomalies averaged over the region Equator to 60oN and 80oW to 0oW minus the SST anomalies averaged over 60oS to 60oN. Note that the vertical axes are different for each time series.

The one-sided 95% confidence level with a t distribution is represented in grey. The effective sample size has been computed taking into account the autocorrelation of the observational time series. A two-sided t test (where the effective sample size has been computed taking into account the autocorrelation of the observational time series) has been used to test the differences between the correlation of the initialized and non-initialized experiments, but no differences where found statistically significant with a confidence equal or higher than 90%.

Note that these ranges apply to the difference between two 20-year means, 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, which accounts for the bars being centred at a smaller value than the end point of the annual trajectories. For the highest (RCP8.5) and lowest (RCP2.6) scenario, illustrative maps of surface temperature change at the end of the 21st century (2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005) are shown for two CMIP5 models. These models are chosen to show a rather broad range of response, but this particular set is not representative of any measure of model response uncertainty.

The boxes and whiskers indicate the 5th percentile, mean value – 1 standard deviation, mean, mean value + 1 standard deviation and 95th percentile of the distributions. The first box-and-whiskers on the left is computed directly from the CMIP3 ensemble and corresponds to the numbers quoted in AR4. The emulated SRES A1B projections (second from left) of CMIP5 are obtained by the method of Good et al. (2011a) and are calculated for the period 20802099 expressed with respect to the AR4 baseline period of 1980–1999. Because of the method, the subset of CMIP5 that are emulated are restricted to those with pre-industrial control, abrupt 4 × CO2, historical, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 simulations. The emulated RCP6.0 projections of CMIP3 (third from left, see also Figure 12.8) are from Knutti and Sedláček (2013) obtained using the method of Meinshausen et al. (2011b; 2011c) and are calculated for the slightly different future period 2081–2100 to be consistent with the rest of this chapter, and are expressed with respect to the AR5 baseline period of 1986–2005. The box-and-whiskers fourth from the left are a graphical representation of the numbers shown in Table 12.2. The final box-and-whiskers on the right is a combination of CMIP5 model output and emulation of CMIP5 RCP6.0 numbers for those models that did not run RCP6.0.

  caption: Temperature (left) and precipitation (right) change patterns derived from transient simulations from the CMIP5 ensembles, scaled to 1°C of global mean surface temperature change. The patterns have been calculated by computing 20-year averages at the end of the 21st (top) and 22nd (bottom) centuries and over the period 1986–2005 for the available simulations under all RCPs, taking their difference (percentage difference in the case of precipitation) and normalizing it, grid-point by grid-point, by the corresponding value of global average temperature change for each model and scenario. The normalized patterns have then been averaged across models and scenarios. The colour scale represents degrees Celsius (in the case of temperature) and percent (in the case of precipitation) per 1°C of global average temperature change. Stippling indicates where the mean change averaged over all realizations is larger than the 95% percentile of the distribution of models. Zonal means of the geographical patterns are shown for each individual model for RCP2.6 (blue), 4.5 (light blue), 6.0 (orange) and 8.5 (red). RCP8.5 is excluded from the stabilization figures. The RCP2.6 simulation of the FIO-ESM (First Institute of Oceanography) model was excluded because it did not show any warming by the end of the 21st century, thus not complying with the method requirement that the pattern be estimated at a time when the temperature change signal from CO2 increase has emerged.

  caption: Schematic diagram of projected changes in major components of the water cycle. The blue arrows indicate major types of water movement changes through the Earth’s climate system: poleward water transport by extratropical winds, evaporation from the surface and runoff from the land to the oceans. The shaded regions denote areas more likely to become drier or wetter. Yellow arrows indicate an important atmospheric circulation change by the Hadley Circulation, whose upward motion promotes tropical rainfall, while suppressing subtropical rainfall. Model projections indicate that the Hadley Circulation will shift its downward branch poleward in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with associated drying. Wetter conditions are projected at high latitudes, because a warmer atmosphere will allow greater precipitation, with greater movement of water into these regions.

  caption: Global mean radiative forcing (RF, W m–2) between 1980 and 2100 estimated by alternative methods. The baseline is circa 1850 but dependent on the methods. Dashed lines indicate the total anthropogenic plus natural (solar and volcanic) RF for the RCP scenarios as defined by Meinshausen et al. (2011c), taking into account the efficacies of the various anthropogenic forcings (Meinshausen et al., 2011a), normalized by the mean between 1850 and 1859. Solid lines are multi-model mean effective radiative forcing (ERF) realized in a subset of CMIP5 models for the concentration-driven historical experiment and RCP scenarios, normalized either with respect to the 1850–1869 base period or with respect to the pre-industrial control simulation (Forster et al., 2013). (The subset of CMIP5 models included is defined by Table 1 of Forster et al. (2013) but omitting the FGOALS-s2 (Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System) model, the historical and RCP simulations of which were subsequently withdrawn from the CMIP5 archive.) This CMIP5-based estimate assumes each model has an invariant climate feedback parameter, calculated from abrupt 4 × CO2 experiments using the method of Gregory et al. (2004). Each individual CMIP5 model’s forcing estimate is an average over all available ensemble members, and a 1-σ inter-model range around the multi-model mean is shaded in light colour. Grey or coloured vertical bars illustrate the 1-σ range (68% confidence interval) of anthropogenic composition forcing (excluding natural and land use change forcings, based on ERF for aerosols combined with RF for WMGHG) estimated in ACCMIP models (Shindell et al., 2013b) for time slice experiments at 1980, 2000, 2030 (RCP8.5 only) and 2100 (all RCPs). The ACCMIP ranges plotted have been converted from the 5 to 95% ranges given in Shindell et al. (2013b) (Table 8) to a 1-σ range. Note that the ACCMIP bars at 1980 and 2100 are shifted slightly to aid clarity. The mean ERF diagnosed from 21 CMIP3 models for the SRES A1B scenario, as in Forster and Taylor (2006), is also shown (thick green line) with a 1-σ range (thinner green lines). The number of models included in CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble means is shown colour coded. (See Tables AII.6.8 to AII.6.10. Note that the CMIP5 model ranges given in Table AII.6.10 are based on decadal averages and therefore differ slightly from the ranges based on annual data shown in this figure.)

  caption: Patterns of temperature (left column) and percent precipitation change (right column) for the CMIP3 models average (first row) and CMIP5 models average (second row), scaled by the corresponding global average temperature changes. The patterns are computed in both cases by taking the difference between the averages over the last 20 years of the 21st century experiments (2080–2099 for CMIP3 and 2081–2100 for CMIP5) and the last twenty years of the historic experiments (1980–1999 for CMIP3, 1986–2005 for CMIP5) and rescaling each difference by the corresponding change in global average temperature. This is done first for each individual model, and then the results are averaged across models. For the CMIP5 patterns, the RCP2.6 simulation of the FIO-ESM model was excluded because it did not show any warming by the end of the 21st century, thus not complying with the method requirement that the pattern be estimated at a time when the temperature change signal from CO2 increase has emerged. Stippling indicates a measure of significance of the difference between the two corresponding patterns obtained by a bootstrap exercise. Two subsets of the pooled set of CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble members of the same size as the original ensembles, but without distinguishing CMIP3 from CMIP5 members, were randomly sampled 500 times. For each random sample we compute the corresponding patterns and their difference, then the true difference is compared, grid-point by grid-point, to the distribution of the bootstrapped differences, and only grid-points at which the value of the difference falls in the tails of the bootstrapped distribution (less than the 2.5 percentiles or the 97.5 percentiles) are stippled.

Annual mean changes are calculated for each year between 2006 and 2100 from one ensemble member per model relative to its mean precipitation and temperature for the 1986–2005 baseline period, and the gradient of a least-squares fit through the annual data is derived. Land and ocean derived values use global mean temperature in the denominator of dP/dT. Each coloured symbol represents a different model, the same symbol being used for the same model for different RCPs and larger black squares being the multi-model mean. Also shown for comparison are global mean results for ENSEMBLES model concentrations-driven projections for the E1 and A1B scenarios (Johns et al., 2011), in this case using a leastsquares fit derived over the period 2000–2099 and taking percentage changes relative to the 1980–1999 baseline period.

  caption: Links in the chain from scenarios, through models to climate projections. The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are designed to sample a range of radiative forcing (RF) of the climate system at 2100. The RCPs are translated into both concentrations and emissions of greenhouse gases using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). These are then used as inputs to dynamical Earth System Models (ESMs) in simulations that are either concentration-driven (the majority of projection experiments) or emissions-driven (only for RCP8.5). Aerosols and other forcing factors are implemented in different ways in each ESM. The ESM projections each have a potentially different RF, which may be viewed as an output of the model and which may not correspond to precisely the level of RF indicated by the RCP nomenclature. Similarly, for concentration-driven experiments, the emissions consistent with those concentrations diagnosed from the ESM may be different from those specified in the RCP (diagnosed from the IAM). Different models produce different responses even under the same RF. Uncertainty propagates through the chain and results in a spread of ESM projections. This spread is only one way of assessing uncertainty in projections. Alternative methods, which combine information from simple and complex models and observations through statistical models or expert judgement, are also used to quantify that uncertainty.

The four RCP scenarios used in CMIP5 are: RCP2.6 (dark blue), RCP4.5 (light blue), RCP6.0 (orange) and RCP8.5 (red). The three SRES scenarios used in CMIP3 are: B1 (blue, dashed), A1B (green, dashed) and A2 (red, dashed). Positive values correspond to the total anthropogenic RF. Negative values correspond to the forcing from all anthropogenic aerosol–radiation interactions (i.e., direct effects only). The total RF of the SRES and RCP families of scenarios differs in 2000 because the number of forcings represented and our knowledge about them have changed since the TAR. The total RF of the RCP family is computed taking into account the efficacy of the various forcings (Meinshausen et al., 2011a). (b) Contribution of the individual anthropogenic forcings to the total RF in year 2100 for the four RCP scenarios and at present day (year 2010). The individual forcings are gathered into seven groups: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3), other greenhouse gases, aerosol (all effects unlike in (a), i.e., aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, aerosol deposition on snow) and land use (LU). (c) As in (b), but the individual forcings are relative to the total RF (i.e., RFx/ RFtot, in %, with RFx individual RFs and RFtot total RF). Note that the RFs in (b) and (c) are not efficacy adjusted, unlike in (a). The values shown in (a) are summarized in Table AII.6.8. The values shown in (b) and (c) have been directly extracted from data files (hosted at http://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at:8787/RcpDb/) compiled by the four modelling teams that developed the RCP scenarios and are summarized in Tables AII.6.1 to AII.6.3 for CO2, CH4 and N2O respectively.

(b) Global temperature change relative to pre-industrial for the pathways shown in panel (a). (c) Grey shaded bands show Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) emission pathways over the 21st century. The pathways were grouped based on ranges of likely avoided temperature increase in the 21st century. Pathways in the darkest three bands likely stay below 2°C, 3°C, 4°C by 2100, respectively (see legend), while those in the lightest grey band are higher than that. Emission corridors were defined by, at each year, identifying the 15th to 85th percentile range of emissions and drawing the corresponding bands across the range. Individual scenarios that follow the upper edge of the bands early on tend to follow the lower edge of the band later on. Black-white lines show median paths per range. (d) Global temperature relative to pre-industrial for the pathways in (c). (Data in (c) and (d) based on Rogelj et al. (2011).) Coloured lines in (c) and (d) denote the four RCP scenarios.

Storm-track computation uses the method of Bengtsson et al. (2006, their Figure 13a) applied to 6-hourly 850 hPa vorticity computed from horizontal winds in the CMIP5 archive. The number of models used appears in the upper right of each panel. DJF panels include data for December 1985 and 2080 and exclude December 2005 and December 2100 for in-season continuity. Stippling marks locations where at least 90% of the models agree on the sign of the change; note that this criterion differs from that used for many other figures in this chapter, due to the small number of models providing sufficient data to estimate internal variability of 20-year means of storm-track statistics. Densities have units (number density per month per unit area), where the unit area is equivalent to a 5° spherical cap (~106 km2). Locations where the scenario or contemporary-climate ensemble average is below 0.5 density units are left white.

  caption: Heat uptake by the climate system during the 21st century relative to 1986–2005 projected by CMIP5 Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) under RCP scenarios (1 YJ = 1024 J). The heat uptake is diagnosed by two different methods. The thick solid lines, and the coloured ranges for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are the timeand global integral of the net downward radiative flux perturbation at the top of the atmosphere, from the 21 AOGCMs used to make the global mean sea level projections (in some cases estimated from other scenarios, as described in the Supplementary Material). The broken solid lines, and the thin solid lines delimiting ranges for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are the global volume integral of ocean temperature change, in a smaller and different set of AOGCMs for each scenario. The difference between the two diagnoses is due partly to the different sets of models (which is a consequence of diagnostics available in the CMIP5 data set), and partly to heat uptake in other parts of the simulated climate system than the ocean water. In both methods, climate drift in the pre-industrial control run has been subtracted.

For Greenland, average equilibrium line locations during both these time periods are shown in purple and green, respectively.

For Greenland, results of flowline modelling for four major outlet glaciers are shown as inserts, while for Antarctica the coloured rings reflect projected change in outflow based on a probabilistic extrapolation of observed trends. The outer and inner radius of each ring indicate the upper and lower bounds of the two-thirds probability range of the contribution, respectively (scale in upper right); red refers to mass loss (sea level rise) while blue refers to mass gain (sea level fall). Finally, the sea level contribution is shown for each ice sheet (insert located above maps) with light grey referring to SMB (model experiment used to generate the SMB map is shown as a dashed line) and dark grey to outflow. All projections refer to the two-in-three probability range across all scenarios.

  caption: Projections from process-based models with likely ranges and median values for global mean sea level rise and its contributions in 2081–2100 relative to 1986– 2005 for the four RCP scenarios and scenario SRES A1B used in the AR4. The contributions from ice sheets include the contributions from ice-sheet rapid dynamical change, which are also shown separately. The contributions from ice-sheet rapid dynamical change and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, and as independent of scenario (except that a higher rate of change is used for Greenland ice-sheet outflow under RCP8.5). This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. See discussion in Sections 13.5.1 and 13.5.3 and Supplementary Material for methods. Only the collapse of the marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level (GMSL) to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential additional contribution cannot be precisely quantified but there is medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise.

The lines show the median projections. For GMSL rise and the thermal expansion contribution, the likely range is shown as a shaded band.

The range provided for the total sea level change represents the maximum possible spread that can be obtained from the four different contributions. Light red-shaded bars show the likely range for the 21st century total sea level projection of the corresponding scenarios from Figure 13.10 with the median as the horizontal line.

The grey lines in panels (a)-(d) are the sums of the contributions from modelled ocean thermal expansion and glaciers (excluding glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic ice sheet; from Marzeion et al., 2012a), plus changes in land-water storage (see Figure 13.4). The black line is the mean of the grey lines plus a correction of thermal expansion for the omission of volcanic forcing in the AOGCM control experiments (see Section 13.3.1.2). The dashed black line (adjusted model mean) is the sum of the corrected model mean thermal expansion, the change in land water storage, the Marzeion et al. (2012a) glacier estimate using observed (rather than modelled) climate (see Figure 13.4), and an illustrative long-term ice-sheet contribution (of 0.1 mm yr–1). The dotted black line is the adjusted model mean but now including the observed ice-sheet contributions, which begin in 1993. Because the observational ice-sheet estimates include the glaciers peripheral to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (from Section 4.4), the contribution from glaciers to the adjusted model mean excludes the peripheral glaciers to avoid double counting.

(b) The cumulative total energy inflow from (a, black) is balanced by the sum of the warming of the Earth system (blue; energy absorbed in warming the ocean, the atmosphere and the land and in the melting of ice) and an increase in outgoing radiation inferred from changes in the global averaged surface temperature.

Black thick line indicates the observed blocking frequency derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis. Only CMIP5 models with available 500 hPa geopotential height daily data at http://pcmdi3.llnl.gov/esgcet/home.htm have been used. Blocking is defined as in Barriopedro et al. (2006), which uses a modified version of the(Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990) index. Daily data was interpolated to a common regular 2.5° × 2.5° longitude–latitude grid before detecting blocking.

  caption: Summary of multi-model ensemble simulations of wintertime (December to February) mean North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) sea level pressure (SLP) indices for historical and RCP4.5 scenarios produced by 39 climate models participating in CMIP5. Panels (a)–(c) show time series of the ensemble mean (black line) and inter-quartile range (grey shading) of the mean index for each model. Panels (d)–(f) show scatter plots of individual model 2081–2100 time means versus 1986–2005 time means (black crosses) together with (–2,+2) standard error bars. The NAO index is defined here as the difference of regional averages: (90°W to 60°E, 20°N to 55°N) minus (90°W to 60°E, 55°N to 90°N) (see Stephenson et al., 2006). The NAM and SAM are defined as zonal indices: NAM as the difference in zonal mean SLP at 35°N and 65°N (Li and Wang, 2003) and SAM as the difference in zonal mean SLP at 40°S and 65°S (Gong and Wang, 1999). All indices have been centred to have zero time mean from 1861–1900. Comparison of simulated and observed trends from 1961–2011 is shown in Figure 10.13.

  caption: General consensus assessment of the numerical experiments described in Supplementary Material Tables 14.SM.1 to 14.SM.4. All values represent expected percent change in the average over period 2081–2100 relative to 2000–2019, under an A1B-like scenario, based on expert judgement after subjective normalization of the model projections. Four metrics were considered: the percent change in (I) the total annual frequency of tropical storms, (II) the annual frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms, (III) the mean Lifetime Maximum Intensity (LMI; the maximum intensity achieved during a storm’s lifetime) and (IV) the precipitation rate within 200 km of storm centre at the time of LMI. For each metric plotted, the solid blue line is the best guess of the expected percent change, and the coloured bar provides the 67% (likely) confidence interval for this value (note that this interval ranges across –100% to +200% for the annual frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms in the North Atlantic). Where a metric is not plotted, there are insufficient data (denoted ‘insf. d.’) available to complete an assessment. A randomly drawn (and coloured) selection of historical storm tracks are underlain to identify regions of tropical cyclone activity.

In all panels, El Niño (La Niña) periods are defined as years having DJF Nino3.4 SST above (below) one standard deviation relative to the mean of the detrended time series. For ensemble mean calculations, all SLP anomalies have been normalized to the standard deviation of the ensemblemember detrended Nino3.4 SST. (e) Change in the ‘centre of mass’ of the Aleutian Low SLP anomaly, RCP4.5–20th century. The Aleutian Low SLP centre of mass is a vector with two elements (lat, lon), and is defined as the sum of (lat, lon) weighted by the SLP anomaly, over all points in the region 180°E to 120°E, 40°N to 60°N having a negative SLP anomaly during El Niño.

(a) Mean climate conditions in the tropical Pacific, indicating sea surface temperatures (SSTs), surface wind stress and associated Walker Circulation, the mean position of convection and the mean upwelling and position of the thermocline. (b) Typical conditions during an El Niño event. SSTs are anomalously warm in the east; convection moves into the central Pacific; the trade winds weaken in the east and the Walker Circulation is disrupted; the thermocline flattens and the upwelling is reduced. (c) The likely mean conditions under climate change derived from observations, theory and coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs). The trade winds weaken; the thermocline flattens and shoals; the upwelling is reduced although the mean vertical temperature gradient is increased; and SSTs (shown as anomalies with respect to the mean tropical-wide warming) increase more on the equator than off. Diagrams with absolute SST fields are shown on the left, diagrams with SST anomalies are shown on the right. For the climate change fields, anomalies are expressed with respect to the basin average temperature change so that blue colours indicate a warming smaller than the basin mean, not a cooling (Collins et al., 2010).

  caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the main ways that human activity influences monsoon rainfall. As the climate warms, increasing water vapour transport from the ocean into land increases because warmer air contains more water vapour. This also increases the potential for heavy rainfalls. Warming-related changes in large-scale circulation influence the strength and extent of the overall monsoon circulation. Land use change and atmospheric aerosol loading can also affect the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed in the atmosphere and land, potentially moderating the land–sea temperature difference.

(2012) and Radić et al. (2013). The mean sea level equivalent (SLE) of the mean glacier mass is the mean of estimates from the same four studies, using an ocean area of 362.5 × 106 km2 for conversion. All values were derived with globally consistent methods; deviations from more precise national data sets are thus possible. Ongoing improvements may lead to revisions of these (RGI 2.0) numbers in future releases of the RGI.

An indication, where known, of what causes these changes (climate, CO2, land use change) is also given with an indication of the sign: ‘+’ means that an increase in CO2 or global-mean temperature is associated with an increase in carbon storage (positive β or γ; see Section 6.4.2), and a ‘–’ means an increase in CO2 or global-mean temperature is associated with a decrease in carbon storage (negative β or γ). The processes that operate to drive these changes can vary markedly, for example, from seasonal phenology of vegetation to long-term changes in ice sheet cover or ocean circulation impacting carbon reservoirs. Some of these processes are ‘reversible’ in the context that they can increase and decrease cyclically, whereas some are ‘irreversible’ in the context that changes in one sense might be much longer than in the opposite direction.

Only studies covering at least 5 years of each decade have been used. Reported values correspond to the mean of the cited references and therefore not always equal (max-min)/2; likewise, ranges [in brackets] represent minimum and maximum values of the cited references. The sum of sources and sinks from B-U approaches does not automatically balance the atmospheric changes. For B-U studies, individual source types are also presented. For T-D inversions, the 1980s decade starts in 1984. As some atmospheric inversions did not reference their global sink, balance with the atmosphere and the sum of the sources has been assumed. One biomass burning estimate (Schultz et al., 2007) excludes biofuels (a). Stratospheric loss for B-U is the sum of the loss by OH radicals, a 10 Tg yr–1 loss due to O1D radicals (Neef et al., 2010) and a 20 to 35% contribution due to Cl radicals24 (Allan et al., 2007).

  caption: Configurations of simulations designed for feedback analysis by allowing some carbon–climate interactions to operate but holding others constant. The curves denote whether increasing or constant CO2 values are input to the radiation and carbon cycle model components. In a fully coupled simulation, the carbon cycle components of the models experience both changes in atmospheric CO2 (see Box 6.3 on fertilisation) and changes in climate. In ‘biogeochemically’ coupled experiments, the atmospheric radiation experiences constant CO2 (i.e., the radiative forcing of increased CO2 is not activated in the simulation) whereas the carbon cycle model components experience increasing CO2. This experiment quantifies the strength of the effect of rising CO2 concentration alone on the carbon cycle (β). In a radiatively coupled experiment, the climate model’s radiation scheme experiences an increase in the radiative forcing of CO2 (and hence produces a change in climate) but CO2 concentration is kept fixed to pre-industrial value as input to the carbon cycle model components. This simulation quantifies the effect of climate change alone on the carbon cycle (γ).

NMVOCs stand for non-methane volatile organic compounds. (b) Global natural emissions of aerosols and aerosol precursors. Dust and sea-spray estimates span the range in the historical CMIP5 simulations. The ranges for monoterpenes and isoprene are from Arneth et al. (2008). There are other biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) such as sesquiterpenes, alcohols and aldehydes which are not listed here. Marine primary organic aerosol (POA) and terrestrial primary biological aerosol particle (PBAP) emission ranges are from Gantt et al. (2011) and Burrows et al. (2009), respectively. Note that emission fluxes from mineral dust, sea spray and terrestrial PBAPs are highly sensitive to the cut-off radius. The conversion rate of BVOCs to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is also indicated using the range from Spracklen et al. (2011) and a lower bound from Kanakidou et al. (2005).

CO2 concentrations are the average of NOAA and SIO. See Table 2.1 for more details of the data sources. The data for 2005 (the time of the AR4 estimates) are also shown. Some of the concentrations vary slightly from those reported in AR4 owing to averaging different data sources. Radiative efficiencies for the minor gases are given in Table 8.A.1. Uncertainties in the RF for all gases are dominated by the uncertainties in the radiative efficiencies. We assume the uncertainties in the radiative efficiencies to be perfectly correlated between the gases, and the uncertainties in the present day and 1750 concentrations to be uncorrelated.

Detailed CMIP5 model description can be found in Table 9.A.1 (* refers to Table 9.A.1 for more details). Official CMIP model names are used. HT stands for High-Top atmosphere, which has a fully resolved stratosphere with a model top above the stratopause. AMIP stands for models with atmosphere and land surface only, using observed sea surface temperature and sea ice extent. A component is coloured when it includes at least a physically based prognostic equation and at least a two-way coupling with another component, allowing climate feedbacks. For aerosols, lighter shading means ‘semi-interactive’ and darker shading means ‘fully interactive’. The resolution of the land surface usually follows that of the atmosphere, and the resolution of the sea ice follows that of the ocean. In moving from CMIP3 to CMIP5, note the increased complexity and resolution as well as the absence of artificial flux correction (FC) used in some CMIP3 models.

  caption: Effective radiative forcing (ERF), climate sensitivity and climate feedbacks estimated for the CMIP5 AOGCMs (see Table 9.1 for model details). ERF, equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) are based on Andrews et al. ( 2012) and Forster et al. (2013) and updated from the CMIP5 archive. The ERF entries are calculated according to Hansen et al. (2005) using fixed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and Gregory et al. (2004) using regression. ECS is calculated using regressions following Gregory et al. (2004). TCR is calculated from the CMIP5 simulations with 1% CO2 increase per year (Taylor et al., 2012b), using the 20-year mean centred on the year of CO2 doubling. The climate sensitivity parameter and its inverse, the climate feedback parameter, are calculated from the regression-based ERF and the ECS. Strengths of the individual feedbacks are taken from Vial et al. (2013), following Soden et al. (2008) and using radiative kernel methods with two different kernels. The sign convention is such that a positive entry for an individual feedback marks a positive feedback; the sum of individual feedback strengths must hence be multiplied by –1 to make it comparable to the climate feedback parameter. The entries for radiative forcing and equilibrium climate sensitivity were obtained by dividing by two the original results, which were obtained for CO2 quadrupling. ERF and ECS for BNU-ESM are from Vial et al. (2013).

The percentages in brackets use an alternative reference period for the model projections of 2006–2012, together with the observed temperature difference between 1986–2005 and 2006–2012 of 0.16°C. The definition of crossing is that the 20-year mean exceeds the specified temperature level. Note that these percentages should not be interpreted as likelihoods because there are other sources of uncertainty (see discussion in Section 11.3.6.3).

See Section 13.5.1 concerning how the likely range is defined. Because some of the uncertainties in modelling the contributions are treated as uncorrelated, the sum of the lower bound of contributions does not equal the lower bound of the sum, and similarly for the upper bound (see Supplementary Material). Because of imprecision from rounding, the sum of the medians of contributions may not exactly equal the median of the sum. The net contribution (surface mass balance (SMB) + dynamics) for each ice sheet, and the contribution from rapid dynamical change in both ice sheets together, are shown as additional lines below the sum; they are not contributions in addition to those given above the sum. The contributions from ice-sheet rapid dynamical change and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, uncorrelated with the magnitude of global climate change (except for the interaction between Antarctic ice sheet SMB and outflow), and as independent of scenario (except that a higher rate of change is used for Greenland ice sheet outflow under RCP8.5). This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. Regional sea level change is expected in general to differ from the global mean (see Section 13.6).

The 26 SREX regions are: Alaska/NW Canada (ALA), Eastern Canada/Greenland/Iceland (CGI), Western North America (WNA), Central North America (CNA), Eastern North America (ENA), Central America/Mexico (CAM), Amazon (AMZ), NE Brazil (NEB), West Coast South America (WSA), Southeastern South America (SSA), Northern Europe (NEU), Central Europe (CEU), Southern Europe/the Mediterranean (MED), Sahara (SAH), Western Africa (WAF), Eastern Africa (EAF), Southern Africa (SAF), Northern Asia (NAS), Western Asia (WAS), Central Asia (CAS), Tibetan Plateau (TIB), Eastern Asia (EAS), Southern Asia (SAS), Southeastern Asia (SEA), Northern Australia (NAS) and Southern Australia/New Zealand (SAU). The area-mean temperature and precipitation responses are first averaged for each model over the 1986–2005 period from the historical simulations and the 2016–2035, 2046–2065 and 2081–2100 periods of the RCP4.5 experiments. Based on the difference between these two periods, the table shows the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, and the lowest and highest response among the 42 models, for temperature in degrees Celsius and precipitation as a percent change. Regions in which the middle half (25 to 75%) of this distribution is all of the same sign in the precipitation response are coloured light brown for decreasing precipitation and light green for increasing precipitation. Information is provided for land areas contained in the boxes unless otherwise indicated. The temperature responses are averaged over the boreal winter and summer seasons; December, January and February (DJF) and June, July and August (JJA) respectively. The precipitation responses are averaged over half year periods, boreal winter; October, November, December, January, February and March (ONDJFM) and summer; April, May, June, July, August and September (AMJJAS).

  caption: Summary of the relevance of projected changes in major phenomena for mean change in future regional climate. The relevance is classified into high (red), medium (yellow), low (cyan), and ‘no obvious relevance’ (grey), based on confidence that there will be a change in the phenomena (‘HP’ for high, ‘MP’ for medium, ‘LP’ for low), and confidence in the impact of the phenomena on each region (‘HI’ for high, ‘MI’ for medium, ‘LI’ for low). More information on how these assessments have been constructed is given in the Supplementary Material (Section 14.SM.6.1).

  caption: Assessed confidence (high, medium, low) in climate projections of regional temperature and precipitation change from the multi-model ensemble of CMIP5 models for the RCP4.5 scenario. Column 1 refers to the SREX regions (cf. Seneviratne et al., 2012, page 12. The region’s coordinates can be found from their online Appendix 3.A) and six additional regions including the two polar regions, the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Island States (see Annex I for further details). Columns 2 to 4 show confidence in models’ ability to simulate present-day mean temperature and precipitation as well as the most important phenomena for that region based on Figures 9.39, 9.40, and 9.45. In column 4, the individual phenomena are listed, with associated confidence levels shown below, in the same order as the phenomena. Note that only phenomena assessed in Figure 9.45 are listed. Column 5 is an interpretation of the relevance of the main climate phenomena for future regional climate change, based on Table 14.3. Note that the SREX regions are smaller than the regions listed in Table 14.3. Columns 6 and 7 express confidence in projected temperature and precipitation changes, based solely on model agreement for 2080–2099 vs. 1985–2005, as listed in Table 14.1 and in the maps shown in Annex I. The confidence is assessed for two periods for temperature (DJF and JJA) and two-half year periods for precipitation (October to March and April to September). When the projections are consistent with no significant change, it is marked by an asterisk (*) and the assigned confidence is medium. Further details on how confidence levels have been assigned are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section 14.SM.6.1).
