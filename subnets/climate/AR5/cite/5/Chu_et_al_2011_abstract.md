Seasonal temperature variability over longer timescales could offer new insights into understanding different forcing factors and response processes in the climate system. Here we report an alkenone-based temperature reconstruction for growing season over the past 1600 years from the varved sediment in Lake Sihailongwan, northeastern China. The most notable cold spells occurred during the periods ad 480–860, ad 1260–1300, ad 1510–1570 and ad 1800–1900 with a temperature decrease of about 1°C compared with the 20th century. Based on the historical evidence such as ‘snow or frost in the summertime’ and ‘no ice during the wintertime’, we compile extreme cold summer events and warm winter events over the past 1600 years. The ‘Little Ice Age’ time period experienced more extreme cold summer/warm winter events, while the ‘Medieval Warm Period’ had milder winters. Comparatively, the natural proxy data show a general similar pattern with historical documents at decadal time scales, except for between ad 1620 and 1720. Our results show multidecadal to centennial variations in seasonal temperature, possibly caused by interactions of external natural forcing and atmosphere–ocean circulations.
