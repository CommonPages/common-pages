Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1314 of the North Atlantic is a critical sedimentary archive record of subpolar deep water from the southern Gardar Drift for which we derived an age model of orbital resolution for the last 1.8 Ma. This chronology combined with high‐resolution (cm scale) X‐ray fluorescence core scanning measurements of major elements allows tracking changes in terrigenous provenance during the last 1.1 Ma. Low Potassium to Titanium (K/Ti) ratios reflect enhanced transport of basalt‐derived titanomagnetites during warm climate intervals, while high K/Ti ratios indicate a dominance of acidic sediment sources typical for glacial and stadial events. Changes in K/Ti and magnetic concentration at Site 1314 are coeval with fluctuations in smectite content and grain size data from nearby piston cores, suggesting that the provenance changes are mainly controlled by variable flow of the Iceland‐Scotland Overflow Water, an important branch of North Atlantic Deep Water. Furthermore, K/Ti variations on orbital time scales show a striking similarity to the deep sea δ13C record from ODP Site 607. Pervasive features of the K/Ti time series during and after the Mid‐Pleistocene Transition are suborbital changes similar to Dansgaard/Oeschger and Bond oscillations that appear to be strongly amplified during ice growth phases when global benthic δ18O was within the range of ∼4.1–4.6 per mil. The strong increase in variability of sediment provenance and subsequently deep hydrography at benthic δ18O values below ∼4.1 suggests that the extent of glaciations and, therefore, sea level corresponding to this value constitutes an important physical threshold that was persistent at least for the last 1.1 Ma.
