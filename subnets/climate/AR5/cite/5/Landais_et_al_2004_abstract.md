Our knowledge of the temperature evolution over Greenland during Dansgaard‐Oeschger events (DO) is currently qualitatively described through the water isotopic profile. Using two independent paleothermometry methods, one based on air isotopic measurements and the other on the combined measurements of water isotopes (δD and δ18O), we show a complete and quantitative reconstruction of temperature at the NorthGRIP site over the period 76 to 62 kyr BP (DO 18, 19 and 20). We confirm that the associated warmings are larger than those conventionally depicted by the water isotopes (11°C, 16°C and 11°C for DO 18, 19 and 20). Secondly, we demonstrate that the relationship between temperature and δ18O varies rapidly during the last glacial period, even over a DO. Finally, our temperature reconstruction over DO 19 agrees well with that predicted from simple climate models linking the DO to iceberg discharges.
