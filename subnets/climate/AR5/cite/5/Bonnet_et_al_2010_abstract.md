A sediment core located on the West Spitzbergen margin in the Fram Strait (78°54.931′N, 6°46.005′E, water depth: 1497m) was analyzed for its dinocyst content in order to reconstruct hydroclimatic variations of the last 2500years. The relative abundance of dinocyst taxa and principal component analysis show a major transition at about 300cal. years BP. It is characterized by the disappearance of thermophilic taxa Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus and Impagidinium sphaericum and the increase of polar–subpolar taxa Impagidinium pallidum and Pentapharsodinium dalei. Sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates suggest warmer conditions than present (anomaly∼+2°C) averaging at 7°C in summer until 300cal. years BP, although cooling pulses are recorded around 1700, 1500, 1200 and 800cal. years BP. The last 300years were marked by a cooling from 7.6 to 3.5°C and sea-ice cover increasing up to 7months/yr. The results demonstrate that the Fram Strait area is sensitive to hydroclimatic variations, notably with respect to sea-ice and SSTs, which are linked to the relative strength of northward flow of North Atlantic waters to the East and southward outflow of cold and fresh waters from the Arctic Ocean. Based on our data, the warmest part of our record around 1320cal. years BP is the only interval of the last 2500years that provides a possible analogue for the modern post-AD 2000 interval, which is characterized by sea-ice free conditions.
