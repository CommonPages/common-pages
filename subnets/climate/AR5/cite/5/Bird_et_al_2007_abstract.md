This study presents a sea-level curve from ∼9500 to ∼6500calBP for the farfield location of Singapore, on the Sunda Shelf in southeast Asia. The curve is based on more than 50 radiocarbon dates from elevations of +1.43m to −15.09m representing sea-level index points in intertidal mangrove and shallow marine sediments deposited by sea-level rise accompanying deglaciation. The results indicate that mean sea level rose rapidly from around −17m at 9500calBP to around −3m by 8000calBP. After this time, the data suggest (but do not unequivocally prove) that the rate of sea-rise slowed for a period of 300–500years centred on ∼7700calBP, shortly after the cessation of meltwater input to the oceans from the northern hemisphere. Renewed sea-level rise amounting to 3–5m began around 7400calBP and was complete by 7000calBP. The existence of an inflection in the rate of sea-level rise, with a slow-down centred on ∼7700calBP, is broadly consistent with other available sea-level curves over this interval and is supported by evidence of stable shorelines and delta initiation elsewhere at this time, as well as evidence of comparatively rapid retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet beginning around 7500calBP. ‘Stepped’ sea-level rise occurring shortly after 7500calBP and also earlier during deglaciation may have served to focus significant post-glacial episodes of human maritime/coastal dispersal, into comparatively narrow time intervals.
