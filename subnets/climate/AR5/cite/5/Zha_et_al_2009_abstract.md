Palaeoflood hydrological study is a frontal subject of global change study. Using sedimentology, geomorphology and OSL dating methods, the typical palaeoflood slackwater deposits were studied in the Qishuihe River valley. The results showed that five flooding episodes with 21 palaeoflood events occurred during 4300–4250 a B.P., 4250–4190 a B.P., 4190–4100 a B.P., 4100–4000 a B.P. and 3100–3010 a B.P., respectively, during the Holocene period. The palaeoflood peak discharges were calculated with hydrological models. With a combination of the gauged flood, historical flood and palaeoflood hydrological data, the archives of flood events were extended to over 10,000 years in the Qishuihe River valley, and the flood frequency-peak discharge relationship curve was established accurately. These research results played important roles in mitigating flood hazard, hydraulic engineering and also the development of water resources in the semiarid Weihe River basin.
