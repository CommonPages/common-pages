A method is presented to reconstruct decadal variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The spectral characteristics of the NAO on time scales of decades and longer are of particular interest for the understanding of North Atlantic ocean–atmosphere interactions. The reconstruction is based on a transfer model calibration that uses bandpass-filtered time series. The maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) is applied for decomposing the time series variance into different time scales. A total of 43 proxies, including Greenland ice cores and European tree-ring chronologies, are selected and regionally grouped providing four independent reconstructions for the period 1700–1978. The mean reconstruction agrees well with two recently published reconstructions during most of the time period. However, there are considerable differences in the earliest part before 1750. Running correlations between the reconstructions indicate that time-dependent relations exist among the different NAO reconstructions. The results suggest that the geographical distribution of proxies strongly affects the reconstruction and could explain some of the apparent discrepancies among the reconstructions recently published in literature. In the early eighteenth century, external forcing (solar, volcanic) seems to mask the NAO signature within the proxies.
