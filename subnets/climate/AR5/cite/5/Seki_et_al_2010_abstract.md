The Pliocene period is the most recent time when the Earth was globally significantly (∼3°C) warmer than today. However, the existing pCO2 data for the Pliocene are sparse and there is little agreement between the various techniques used to reconstruct palaeo-pCO2. This disagreement, coupled with the general low temporal resolution of the published records, does not allow a robust assessment of the role of declining pCO2 in the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (INHG) and a direct comparison to other proxy records are lacking. For the first time, we use a combination of foraminiferal (δ                      11B) and organic biomarker (alkenone-derived carbon isotopes) proxies to determine the concentration of atmospheric CO2 over the past 5Ma. Both proxy records show that during the warm Pliocene pCO2 was between 330 and 400ppm, i.e. similar to today. The decrease to values similar to pre-industrial times (275–285ppm) occurred between 3.2Ma and 2.8Ma — coincident with the INHG and affirming the link between global climate, the cryosphere and pCO2.
