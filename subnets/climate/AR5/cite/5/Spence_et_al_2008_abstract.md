The effect of increasing horizontal resolution is examined to assess the response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to freshwater perturbations. Versions of a global climate model with horizontal resolutions ranging from 1.8° (latitude) × 3.6° (longitude) to 0.2° × 0.4° are used to determine if the AMOC response to freshwater forcing is robust to increasing resolution. In the preindustrial equilibrium climate, the representation of western boundary currents and meridional heat transport are improved with resolution. Freshwater forcings similar to the final drainage of proglacial Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway are applied evenly over the Labrador Sea and exclusively along the western boundary. The duration and maximum amplitude of model responses to freshwater forcing showed little sensitivity to increasing resolution. An evaluation with tracers of the forcing impact on different regions of North Atlantic Deep Water formation revealed the possibility that increases in Labrador Sea deep convection at higher resolution mitigate the effect of stronger boundary currents and enhanced mixing. With increasing resolution, there is less cooling in the subpolar west Atlantic, more cooling in the subpolar east Atlantic, and greater variability in the deep ocean response to the boundary forcing. While differences exist, the coarse-resolution model response remains robust at finer horizontal resolutions.
