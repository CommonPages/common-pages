The last interglacial period, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, was characterized by global mean surface temperatures that were at least 2 ∘C warmer than present1. Mean sea level stood 4–6 m higher than modern sea level2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, with an important contribution from a reduction of the Greenland ice sheet1,14. Although some fossil reef data indicate sea-level fluctuations of up to 10 m around the mean3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11, so far it has not been possible to constrain the duration and rates of change of these shorter-term variations. Here, we use a combination of a continuous high-resolution sea-level record, based on the stable oxygen isotopes of planktonic foraminifera from the central Red Sea15,16,17,18, and age constraints from coral data to estimate rates of sea-level change during MIS-5e. We find average rates of sea-level rise of 1.6 m per century. As global mean temperatures during MIS-5e were comparable to projections for future climate change under the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions19,20, these observed rates of sea-level change inform the ongoing debate about high versus low rates of sea-level rise in the coming century21,22.
