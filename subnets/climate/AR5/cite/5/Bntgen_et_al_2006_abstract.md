Annually resolved summer temperatures for the European Alps are described. The reconstruction covers the a.d. 755–2004 period and is based on 180 recent and historic larch [Larix decidua Mill.] density series. The regional curve standardization method was applied to preserve interannual to multicentennial variations in this high-elevation proxy dataset. Instrumental measurements from high- (low-) elevation grid boxes back to 1818 (1760) reveal strongest growth response to current-year June–September mean temperatures. The reconstruction correlates at 0.7 with high-elevation temperatures back to 1818, with a greater signal in the higher-frequency domain (r = 0.8). Low-elevation instrumental data back to 1760 agree with the reconstruction’s interannual variation, although a decoupling between (warmer) instrumental and (cooler) proxy data before ∼1840 is noted. This offset is larger than during any period of overlap with more recent high-elevation instrumental data, even though the proxy time series always contains some unexplained variance. The reconstruction indicates positive temperatures in the tenth and thirteenth century that resemble twentieth-century conditions, and are separated by a prolonged cooling from ∼1350 to 1700. Six of the 10 warmest decades over the 755–2004 period are recorded in the twentieth century. Maximum temperature amplitude over the past 1250 yr is estimated to be 3.1°C between the warmest (1940s) and coldest (1810s) decades. This estimate is, however, affected by the calibration with instrumental temperature data. Warm summers seem to coincide with periods of high solar activity, and cold summers vice versa. The record captures the full range of past European temperature variability, that is, the extreme years 1816 and 2003, warmth during medieval and recent times, and cold in between. Comparison with regional- and large-scale reconstructions reveals similar decadal to longer-term variability.
