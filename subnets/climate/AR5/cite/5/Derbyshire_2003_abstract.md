Mineral dust is an important constituent of the solid load in Earth's atmosphere, the total atmospheric aerosol loading being both a function of, and a factor affecting climatic change. Human actions have progressively enhanced atmospheric dust loading, especially in the past century, so that both natural and human-induced effects of atmospheric dust on climatic change require more detailed research. Records of changing climate are preserved in cores from the ocean floors, glaciers and ice sheets, as well as in terrestrial sedimentary sections. Quantitative data on the present-day distribution of atmospheric dust are sparse, but simulation of dust transport and deposition has been modelled with some success. The dust indicators and records of terrestrial and marine palaeoenvironments (DIRTMAP) database was designed to serve as a global validation data set for use with earth system models of the palaeo-dust cycle. Loess, a wind-borne silt deposited on the continents particularly in the past 2.6Myr, is an important potential source of information on past atmospheric dust accumulation. A recent initiative sought to improve the terrestrial data coverage within the existing DIRTMAP database by involving representatives from key loess regions in coordinating the data synthesis process, so as to facilitate interaction between the dust modelling and the data collection communities. The results are presented in this issue. In order to compare past minerogenic dust records (loess) with those in ice and ocean cores, mass accumulation rates (MARs) have been calculated as fluxes (in g/m2/yr). The loess regions covered include North and South America, Europe, Siberia, eastern Asia, and Australasia. It is acknowledged that provision of age models for the calculation of realistic MAR values depends upon a number of conditions, most notably sound chronostratigraphy and realistic values of loess dry bulk densities. The MAR data sets presented here show some notable variation, both within and between the studied regions. Regional MAR coverage also varies, reflecting differences in the availability of key data on loess from one world region to another. Loess facies vary according to specific site and source conditions, as well as in response to post-depositional re-working of primary (wind-lain) loess by surface geomorphic processes. Mean particle size consistently declines downwind, and terrace, valley and upland sites generally yield the highest MAR values, characteristics noted in all regions discussed here. The loess accumulations in two major world regions, central and eastern Asia and the Great Plains region of North America, differ in some important respects from loess elsewhere in that they lie peripheral to deserts and are remote from the former sites of major Quaternary ice sheets. It is concluded that the MARs for terrestrial sites obtained from loess are consistently higher than those obtained from ocean and ice cores, so that future climatic models designed to study the role of global atmospheric dust will have to take full account of the present and past dust records over the continents.
