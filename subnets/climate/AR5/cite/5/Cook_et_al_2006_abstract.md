Progress in the development of millennia‐long tree‐ring chronologies from Australia and New Zealand is reviewed from the perspective of modelling long‐term climate variability there. Three tree species have proved successful in this regard: Huon pine (Lagarostrobos franklinii) from Tasmania, silver pine (L. colensoi) from the South Island of New Zealand, and kauri (Agathis australis) from the North Island of New Zealand. Each of these species is very long‐lived and produces abundant quantities of well‐preserved wood for extending their tree‐ring chronologies back several millennia into the past. The growth patterns on these chronologies strongly correlate with both local and regional warm‐season temperature changes over significant areas of the Southern Hemisphere (especially Huon and silver pine) and to ENSO variability emanating from the equatorial Pacific region (especially kauri). In addition, there is evidence for significant, band‐limited, multi‐decadal and centennial timescale variability in the warm‐season temperature reconstruction based on Huon pine tree rings that may be related to slowly varying changes in ocean circulation dynamics in the southern Indian Ocean. This suggests the possibility of long‐term climate predictability there. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
