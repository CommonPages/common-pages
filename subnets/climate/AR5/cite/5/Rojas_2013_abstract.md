This paper investigates the effect of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) versus high CO2 world boundary condition on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, in particular on the strength and latitudinal position of the near surface Southern Westerly Winds (SWW). PMIP2 and PMIP3 experiments, as well as the “abrupt 4 × CO2” simulations from CMIP5, were analyzed. Robust findings include poleward expansion of the Mean Meridional Circulation (MMC) and intensified and poleward‐shifted SWW in the 4 × CO2 simulations (consistent with recent observations and 21st century climate change projections); and for the LGM, stronger and southward shifted northern hemisphere MMC, and weakened southern Hadley cell. However, six of the eight LGM simulations show a decrease in the SWW, the other two models simulate the opposite. A critical difference between the models is strong coupling between sea‐ice extent, surface temperature gradients, SWW, and Ferrel cell in the two models with stronger and poleward‐shifted SWW.
