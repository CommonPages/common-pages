The El Niño phenomenon involves a large‐scale warming of the equatorial eastern and central Pacific Ocean. Recent developments in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon have raised concerns about climate change. In this review paper, these recent developments are critically assessed and forecasts of possible future changes are reviewed. Since the late‐1970s, El Niño episodes have been unusually recurrent, while the frequency of strong La Niña events has been low. Prolonged/recurrent warm event conditions of the first half of the 1990s were the result of the persistence of an anomalously warm pool near the date line, which, in turn, may be part of an abrupt warming trend in tropical sea‐surface temperatures that occurred in the late‐1970s. The abrupt warming of tropical sea‐surface temperatures has been attributed to the enhanced‐greenhouse effect, but may be indicative of inter‐decadal variability: earlier changes in the frequency of ENSO events and earlier persistent El Niño and La Niña sequences have occurred. Most forecasts of ENSO variability in a doubled‐CO2 climate suggest that the recent changes in the tropical Pacific are anomalous. Of potential concern, however, is a possible reduction in the predictability of ENSO events given a warmer background climate.
