The seasonality of the southern annular mode (SAM) and the resulting impacts on the climate variability of New Zealand (NZ) are investigated. As with previous studies, during summer the SAM is found to be largely zonally symmetric, whereas during winter it exhibits increased zonal wavenumber 2â€“3 variability. This is consistent with seasonal variations in the mean state, and the authors argue that the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature over the Australian continent plays an important role, making the eddy-driven jet, and hence the SAM, more zonally symmetric during summer than winter. During winter, the SAM exhibits little variability over the South Pacific and southeast of Australia. Dynamical reasons for this behavior are discussed.
