Since the mid-1970s the climatic changes that have taken place in southwest Western Australia have generated a variety of impacts, the most prominent of which is a reduction in dam inflows of at least 50 percent. These impacts were the catalyst for the formation of the Indian Ocean Climate Initiative in 1998, a research partnership between two national research organizations and several state government departments and agencies. This paper describes the key scientific findings of the Initiative with respect to the nature of the climatic changes that have taken place within the region, explores the factors that might have caused these changes, and describes the most recent climate projections for the region. We reflect on the factors leading to the rapid acceptance of the research outcomes from the Initiative, the impact of the Initiative on policy development across Australia and its likely evolution post-2006.
