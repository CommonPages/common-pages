The South American monsoon system (SAMS) life cycle plays an important role in the distribution and duration of the rainy season mainly over southwestern Amazonia, and the central west and southeast Brazil regions, affecting the economy through impacts on the agriculture and hydrology sectors. In this study a new criterion is applied to identify the monsoon onset and demise that was not used before in the SAMS region. This criterion is based on the atmospheric humidity flux over an area recognized as the monsoon core because of zonal wind reversal and changes in humidity from the transition seasons to summer and winter. Areas in Brazil that have a monsoon regime are identified, and several features associated with the life cycle are discussed. The climatological onset and demise are identified as the end of October and the end of March, respectively, and an interannual variability is found in the times of onset/demise. The main observed features in the two phases are discussed, such as the role of the South Atlantic subtropical high displacement, the northwestern moisture flux east of Andes and from the Atlantic Ocean, the zonal wind intensity and direction over central South America, the vertical motion over the continent, and the expansion/reduction of the Bolivian high circulation with associated high-level divergence. The frontal systems contribute to the pressure decrease, wind direction changes, and soil moisture increase previous to the onset. Low-frequency troughs with intraseasonal variability establish conditions favorable to the monsoon onset, and low-frequency ridges are related to late onset.
