The effects of anticipated twenty-first-century global climate change on the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) have been studied using a high-resolution version of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) atmospheric GCM. This version of the model is notable for being able to simulate a fairly realistic QBO for present-day conditions including only explicitly resolved nonstationary waves. A long control integration of the model was run with observed climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) appropriate for the late twentieth century, followed by another integration with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and SSTs incremented by the projected twenty-first-century warming in a multimodel ensemble of coupled ocean–atmosphere runs that were forced by the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario of future atmospheric composition. In the experiment for late twenty-first-century conditions the QBO period becomes longer and QBO amplitude weaker than in the late twentieth-century simulation. The downward penetration of the QBO into the lowermost stratosphere is also curtailed in the late twenty-first-century run. These changes are driven by a significant (30%–40%) increase of the mean upwelling in the equatorial stratosphere, and the effect of this enhanced mean circulation overwhelms counteracting influences from strengthened wave fluxes in the warmer climate. The momentum fluxes associated with waves propagating upward into the equatorial stratosphere do strengthen overall by ∼(10%–15%) in the warm simulation, but the increases are almost entirely in zonal phase speed ranges that have little effect on the stratospheric QBO but that would be expected to have important influences in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.
