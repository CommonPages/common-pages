The East Asian (China, Korea and Japan) summer monsoon precipitation and its variability are examined from the outputs of the coupled climate models performing coordinated experiments leading to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). Out of the 22 models examined, 14 reproduce the observed shape of the annual cycle well with peak during the boreal summer (June through August), but with varying magnitude. Three models simulate the maximum a month later and with lower magnitudes. Only one model considerably underestimates the magnitude of the annual cycle. The remaining 4 models show some deviations from the observed. Models are unable to simulate the minimum in July with peaks in June and August associated with northward shifts of the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu precipitation band. The realistic simulation of the annual cycle does not appear to depend on the model resolution. The inter-model variation is slightly larger during summer, implying larger diversity of the models in simulating summer monsoon precipitation.
