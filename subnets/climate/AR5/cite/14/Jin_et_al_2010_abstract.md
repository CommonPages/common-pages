Water cycle components over the Mediterranean for both a current run (1979–2007) and a future run (2075–2099) are studied with the Japan Meteorological Agency’s 20 km grid global climate model. Results are compared with another study using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 ensemble model (hereafter, the Mariotti model). Our results are surprisingly close to Mariotti’s. The projected mean annual change rates of precipitation (P) between the future and the current run for sea and land are −11 per cent and −10 per cent, respectively, which are not as high as Mariotti’s. Projected changes for evaporation (E) are +9.3 per cent and −3.6 per cent, compared with +7.2 per cent and −8.1 per cent in Mariotti’s study, respectively. However, no significant difference in the change in P–E over the sea body was found between these two studies. The increased E over the eastern Mediterranean was found to be higher than that in the western Mediterranean, but the P decrease was lower. The net moisture budget, P–E, shows that the eastern Mediterranean will become even drier than the western Mediterranean. The river model suggests decreasing water inflow to the Mediterranean of approximately 36 per cent (excluding the Nile).
