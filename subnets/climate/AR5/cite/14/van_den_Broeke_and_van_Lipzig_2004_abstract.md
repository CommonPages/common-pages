Output of a 14 year integration with a high-resolution (55 km ×55 km)                   regional atmospheric climate model is used to study the response of Antarctic                   near-surface climate to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), the periodical                   strengthening and weakening of the circumpolar vortex in the Southern Hemisphere.                   In spite of the relatively short record, wind, temperature and precipitation show                   widespread and significant AAO-related signals. When the vortex is strong (high                   AAO index), northwesterly flow anomalies cause warming over the Antarctic                   Peninsula (AP) and adjacent regions in West Antarctica and the Weddell Sea. In                   contrast, cooling occurs in East Antarctica, the eastern Ross Ice Shelf and parts                   of Marie Byrd Land. Most of the annual temperature signal stems from the months                   March–August. The spatial distribution of the precipitation response to changes in                   the AAO does not mirror temperature changes but is in first order determined by                   the direction of flow anomalies with respect to the Antarctic topography. When the                   vortex is strong (high AAO index), the western AP becomes wetter, while the Ross                   Ice Shelf, parts of West Antarctica and the Lambert Glacier basin, East                   Antarctica, become drier.
