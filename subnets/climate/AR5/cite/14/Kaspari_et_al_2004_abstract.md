Thirteen annually resolved accumulation-rate records covering the last ~200                   years from the Pine Island–Thwaites and Ross drainage systems and the South Pole                   are used to examine climate variability over West Antarctica. Accumulation is                   controlled spatially by the topography of the ice sheet, and temporally by changes                   in moisture transport and cyclonic activity. A comparison of mean accumulation                   since 1970 at each site to the long-term mean indicates an increase in                   accumulation for sites located in the western sector of the Pine Island–Thwaites                   drainage system. Accumulation is negatively associated with the Southern                   Oscillation Index (SOI) for sites near the ice divide, and periods of sustained                   negative SOI (1940–42, 1991–95) correspond to above-mean accumulation at most                   sites. Correlations of the accumulation-rate records with sea-level pressure (SLP)                   and the SOI suggest that accumulation near the ice divide and in the Ross drainage                   system may be associated with the mid-latitudes. The post-1970 increase in                   accumulation coupled with strong SLP–accumulation-rate correlations near the coast                   suggests recent intensification of cyclonic activity in the Pine Island– Thwaites                   drainage system.
