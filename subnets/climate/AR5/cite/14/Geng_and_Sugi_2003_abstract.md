To investigate the possible impacts of enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols on extratropical cyclone activity, two 20-yr time-slice experiments—the control run and the global warming run—are performed with a high-resolution AGCM (T106) of the Japan Meteorological Agency. In the control run, the atmosphere is forced by the observed SST and sea ice of 1979–98 and present-day CO2 and sulfate aerosol concentrations. In the global warming run, the atmosphere is forced by the observed SST and sea ice of 1979–98 plus the monthly mean anomalies of SST and sea ice at about the year 2050 obtained from a transient climate change experiment with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled ocean–atmosphere model with a low resolution of R15. The equivalent amounts of CO2 and sulfate aerosol concentrations at about the year 2050 as used in the GFDL R15 model are prescribed. First, the performance of the high-resolution AGCM (T106) in reproducing the extratropical cyclone activity of both hemispheres in the control run is examined—by comparing the cyclone activities simulated in the AGCM and those analyzed from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data of the same period from 1979 to 1998. An objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm is used to analyze the cyclone activity. The results show that the model can reproduce the cyclone activity reasonably well. Second, the possible change in cyclone activity due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols is examined. The main results are summarized as follows. 1) The total cyclone density (number of cyclones in a 4.5° × 4.5° area per season) tends to decrease significantly in the midlatitudes of both of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during the December–January–February (DJF) and June–July–August (JJA) seasons. The decrease of cyclone density in the midlatitudes of both of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the DJF season is about 7%. In the JJA season, the decreases of cyclone density in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres' midlatitudes are about 3% and 10%, respectively. 2) Although weak and medium-strength cyclones decrease, the density of strong cyclones increases by more than 20% in the Northern Hemisphere in JJA and in the Southern Hemisphere in both DJF and JJA. 3) The density of strong cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere summer (JJA) increases over the eastern coasts of Asia and North America. In the Southern Hemisphere, the density of strong cyclones increases over the circumpolar regions around Antarctica in both summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) seasons. The density of strong cyclones also increases over the southeastern coasts of South Africa and South America. Finally, the possible reasons for the change in cyclone activity due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols are examined. It is shown that the changes in the extratropical cyclone activity are closely linked to the changes in the baroclinicity in the lower troposphere, which are mainly related to the changes in the horizontal and vertical temperature distributions in the atmosphere due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. It is shown that, in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, the decrease of baroclinicity is mainly caused by the decrease of meridional temperature gradient, while in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, the decrease of baroclinicity is mainly caused by the increase of static stability caused by the enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols.
