A model study has been made of the mechanisms of the meridional mode in the northern tropical Atlantic (NTA) and the response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The numerical model consists of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a passive mixed layer model for the ocean. Results from two simulations are shown: a control run with present-day atmospheric CO2 and a run with a doubled CO2 concentration. The results from the control run show that the wind–evaporation–SST (WES) feedback is confined to the deep NTA. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the meridional mode is phase locked with the seasonal cycle of the climatological intertropical convergence zone (CITCZ). The WES feedback is positive in boreal winter and spring when the CITCZ is located close to the equator but negative in summer and fall when the CITCZ shifts toward the north of the deep NTA. Similarly, the damping of the SST anomalies in the deep NTA by moisture-induced evaporation anomalies is much stronger in summer and fall than in winter and spring, related to a change in anomalous moisture transport. The results from the double-CO2 run show a substantial northward shift of the CITCZ in boreal winter and spring but little change in summer and fall. The change in the CITCZ can be explained by strong warming at the high northern latitudes in combination with a seasonally dependent WES feedback with accompanying changes in moisture transport in the deep NTA. The latter indicates that the change in the CITCZ is subject to phase locking with the seasonal cycle of the CITCZ itself. The meridional mode in the double-CO2 run weakens by 10%–20%. This originates from the weakening of the positive WES feedback in the deep NTA, which in turn is attributed to the northward shift of the CITCZ; because in the double-CO2 run the CITCZ stays south of the deep NTA for a shorter time period, the positive WES feedback in the deep NTA acts less long, and damping by moisture-induced evaporation anomalies starts earlier than in the control run.
