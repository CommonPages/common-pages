The sensitivity of the atmospheric circulation and rainfall over southern Africa to various regional sea surface temperature (SST) patterns observed during Benguela Niño events is investigated using an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). The model used is the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) HadAM3 and experiments using idealizations of observed regional SST anomalies during various Benguela Niño events are performed. It is found that SST forcing in the tropical southeast Atlantic induces a regional baroclinic response and that a Benguela Niño is capable of forcing anomalous rainfall along the Angolan and northern Namibian coastal regions on its own, via changes in low level moisture convergence, uplift and evaporation over the SST forcing.
