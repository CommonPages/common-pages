In the Northern hemisphere, regions characterized by an enhanced frequency of atmospheric blocking overlap significantly with those associated with the major extra-tropical patterns of large-scale climate variabilityâ€”namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern. There is likewise an overlap in the temporal band-width of blocks and these climate patterns. Here the nature of the linkage between blocks and the climate patterns is explored by using the ERA-40 re-analysis data set to examine (1) their temporal and spatial correlation and (2) the interrelationship between blocks and the NAO/PNA. It is shown that a strong anti-correlation exists between blocking occurrence and the phase of the NAO (PNA) in the North Atlantic (western North Pacific), and that there are distinctive inter-basin differences with a clear geographical (over North Atlantic) and quantitative (over North Pacific) separation of typical blocking genesis/lysis regions during the opposing phases of the climate patterns. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis points to a significant influence of blocking upon the NAO pattern (identifiable as the leading EOF in the Euro-Atlantic), and a temporal analysis indicates that long-lasting blocks are associated with the development of negative NAO/PNA index values throughout their life-time. In addition an indication of a cause-and effect relationship is set-out for the North Atlantic linkage.
