The European winter surface climate response to the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and its dependence on stratospheric resolution is cleanly assessed in idealized seasonal hindcasts with two versions of the Hadley Centre's atmospheric general circulation model. The standard 38‐level version extends to an altitude of 39 km while the extended 60‐level version has enhanced stratospheric resolution and reaches 84‐km altitude. We show that both models generate a realistic stratospheric polar and surface European Arctic Oscillation (AO) response to the QBO for winter hindcasts initialized on 1 December and suggest that the better representation of the QBO in the L60 model will lead to improved forecasts at seasonal‐to‐multiannual timescales.
