Schwartz [2007] (hereinafter referred to as SES) recently suggested a method to calculate equilibrium climate sensitivity (the equilibrium global surface warming for a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration), the effective heat capacity of the Earth's climate system, the temperature response time scale relevant to climate change, an estimate of total radiative forcing as well as the magnitude of the aerosol forcing over the 20th century. The main results are that the characteristic response time scale of global temperature is 5 ± 1 years and climate sensitivity is 0.30 ± 0.14 K/(W m−2), corresponding to an equilibrium temperature increase for doubling atmospheric CO2 of 1.1 ± 0.5 K. In practical terms, this means that global surface temperature is nearly in equilibrium with radiative forcing, and that the sum of all feedbacks (water vapor, lapse rate, clouds, albedo) is close to zero. These results are at odds with most of the current literature on climate sensitivity, the idea of commitment warming and with the magnitudes of climate feedbacks quantified in models and observations. If true, the low climate sensitivity would allow for much higher atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to be consistent with a given stabilization temperature compared to the current consensus. It would also imply that stabilization of atmospheric CO2 would lead to stabilization of global temperatures within a few years.
