To examine the long-term stability of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, idealized simulations are carried out with the climate model ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM). Atmospheric CO2 concentration is increased over 2000 years from preindustrial levels to quadrupling, is then kept constant for 5940 years, is afterward decreased over 2000 years to preindustrial levels, and is finally kept constant for 3940 years. Despite these very slow changes, the sea ice response significantly lags behind the CO2 concentration change. This lag, which is caused by the ocean's thermal inertia, implies that the sea ice equilibrium response to increasing CO2 concentration is substantially underestimated by transient simulations. The sea ice response to CO2 concentration change is not truly hysteretic and is in principle reversible. The authors find no lag in the evolution of Arctic sea ice relative to changes in annual-mean Northern Hemisphere surface temperature. The summer sea ice cover changes linearly with respect to both CO2 concentration and temperature, while the Arctic winter sea ice cover shows a rapid transition to a very low sea ice coverage. This rapid transition of winter sea ice is associated with a sharply enhanced iceâ€“albedo feedback and a sudden onset of convective-cloud feedback in the Arctic. The Antarctic sea ice cover retreats continuously without any rapid transition during the warming. Compared to Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice shows a much more strongly lagged response to changes in CO2 concentration. It even lags behind the surface temperature change, which is caused by a different response of ocean deep convection during the warming and the cooling periods.
