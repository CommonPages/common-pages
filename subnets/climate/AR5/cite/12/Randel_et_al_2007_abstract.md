Near-equatorial ozone observations from balloon and satellite measurements reveal a large annual cycle in ozone above the tropical tropopause. The relative amplitude of the annual cycle is large in a narrow vertical layer between ∼16 and 19 km, with approximately a factor of 2 change in ozone between the minimum (during NH winter) and maximum (during NH summer). The annual cycle in ozone occurs over the same altitude region, and is approximately in phase with the well-known annual variation in tropical temperature. This study shows that the large annual variation in ozone occurs primarily because of variations in vertical transport associated with mean upwelling in the lower stratosphere (the Brewer–Dobson circulation); the maximum relative amplitude peak in the lower stratosphere is collocated with the strongest background vertical gradients in ozone. A similar large seasonal cycle is observed in carbon monoxide (CO) above the tropical tropopause, which is approximately out of phase with ozone (associated with an oppositely signed vertical gradient). The observed ozone and CO variations can be used to constrain estimates of the seasonal cycle in tropical upwelling.
