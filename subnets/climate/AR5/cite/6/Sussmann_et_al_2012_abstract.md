Trends of column-averaged methane for the time period (1996, Sep 2011) are derived from the mid-infrared (mid-IR) solar FTIR time series at the Zugspitze (47.42° N, 10.98° E, 2964 m a.s.l.) and Garmisch (47.48° N, 11.06° E, 743 m a.s.l.). Trend analysis comprises a fit to the de-seasonalized time series along with bootstrap resampling for quantifying trend uncertainties. We find a positive trend during [1996, 1998] of 9.0 [3.2, 14.7] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Zugspitze (95% confidence interval), an insignificant growth during [1999, mid 2006] of 0.8 [−0.1, 1.7] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (Zugspitze), and a significant renewed increase during [mid 2006, Sep 2011] of 5.1 [4.2, 6.0] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Garmisch, which is in agreement with 4.8 [3.8, 5.9] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Zugspitze. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; The agreement of methane trends at the two closely neighboring FTIR sites Zugspitze and Garmisch within the uncertainties indicates a good station-to-station consistency as a basis for future trend analyses by the ground-based mid-IR FTIR network on the global scale. Furthermore, the Zugspitze FTIR trend for the time interval [Jul 2006, Jun 2009] is found to agree with the trend derived from SCIAMACHY (WFM-DOAS v2.0.2) data within the 95% confidence intervals. In case a 1000-km pixel selection radius around the Zugspitze is used, the confidence interval is narrower for the FTIR trend (6.9 [4.2, 9.5] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to SCIAMACHY (7.1 [5.1, 8.6] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). If, however, a loosened pixel selection is used (&amp;amp;approx;1000-km half-width latitudinal band), the SCIAMACHY trend significance interval is narrower (6.8 [5.1, 8.6] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to Zugspitze FTIR (5.7 [3.0, 8.3] ppb yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; While earlier studies using surface network data revealed changes of 8.0 ± 0.6 ppb in 2007, 6.4 ± 0.6 ppb in 2008, and 4.7 ± 0.6 ppb in 2009 (Dlugokencky et al., 2011), our updated result proves that the renewed methane increase meanwhile has been persisting for &gt;5 years [mid 2006, Sep 2011]. This is either the longest and largest positive trend anomaly since the beginning of systematic observations more than 25 years ago or the onset of a new period of strongly increasing CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the atmosphere. Several scenarios have been developed to explain the persistent increase observed, mainly invoking an increase in emissions from natural wetlands, an increase in fossil fuel-related emissions or a decrease in OH concentrations. However, more work is needed to fully attribute this increase to a particular source or sink.
