This paper is the outcome of a group discussion held at the Savonlinna meeting ‘Management of forest ecosystems and its impact on the GHG budget’. The aim of this break-out group discussion was to ‘Characterize forest management impacts on the GHG budget of forest ecosystems in different European regions’. In this paper we briefly characterize different options that a forest owner has in order to maintain or maximize forest carbon pools and carbon sequestration. These hectare scale descriptions of measures are then regarded in connection to the current state of European forests and how they can be combined with ongoing management trends and local issues. We point out the various possibilities that exist in European forests, where they are located, and where they could possibly be combined with adaptation. We identify these hotspots for largest growing stocks, largest peat areas, and, e.g. largest risks for loss of carbon due to fire or urban sprawl. We conclude that one common strategy cannot be designed. Within each region, local solutions have to be found that optimize goals and aim at integrated and sustainable land use.
