In the paper “Marine methane cycle simulations for the period of early global warming” by S. Elliott et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research, 116, G01010, doi:10.1029/2010JG001300, 2011), a mistake was made in the creation of Figure 7, which erroneously showed that only a small fraction (about 1%) of the inert methane tracer released from the ocean sediments into our model escaped to the atmosphere. The correct Figure 7 and its caption appear here. As can be seen in the corrected Figure 7, a much larger fraction is actually released to the atmosphere in this simulation (about 60%). It is important to note that the mistake was made in the analysis script, not in the simulations themselves, so all of the other figures are correct and the conclusions drawn from them are unchanged.
