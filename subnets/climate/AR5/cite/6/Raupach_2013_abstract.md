Several basic ratios of responses to forcings in the carbon-climate system are observed to be relatively steady. Examples include the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; airborne fraction (the fraction of the total anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission flux that accumulates in the atmosphere) and the ratio &lt;i&gt;T/Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; of warming (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) to cumulative total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;). This paper explores the reason for such near-constancy in the past, and its likely limitations in future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The contemporary carbon-climate system is often approximated as a set of first-order linear systems, for example in response-function descriptions. All such linear systems have exponential eigenfunctions in time (an eigenfunction being one that, if applied to the system as a forcing, produces a response of the same shape). This implies that, if the carbon-climate system is idealised as a linear system (Lin) forced by exponentially growing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (Exp), then all ratios of responses to forcings are constant. Important cases are the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; airborne fraction (AF), the cumulative airborne fraction (CAF), other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; partition fractions and cumulative partition fractions into land and ocean stores, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sink uptake rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, the combined land and ocean CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sink flux per unit excess atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the ratio &lt;i&gt;T/Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;. Further, the AF and the CAF are equal. Since the Lin and Exp idealisations apply approximately to the carbon-climate system over the past two centuries, the theory explains the observed near-constancy of the AF, CAF and &lt;i&gt;T/Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; in this period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A nonlinear carbon-climate model is used to explore how future breakdown of both the Lin and Exp idealisations will cause the AF, CAF and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; to depart significantly from constancy, in ways that depend on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions scenarios. However, &lt;i&gt;T/Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; remains approximately constant in typical scenarios, because of compensating interactions between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions trajectories, carbon-climate nonlinearities (in land–air and ocean–air carbon exchanges and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radiative forcing), and emissions trajectories for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gases. This theory establishes a basis for the widely assumed proportionality between &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, and identifies the limits of this relationship.
