We measured methane (CH4) emissions from the stem surfaces of mature Fraxinus mandshurica var. japonica trees in a floodplain forest. Flux measurements were conducted almost monthly from May to October 2005, and positive CH4 fluxes were detected throughout the study period, including the leafless season. The mean CH4 flux was 176 and 97μgCH4                      m−2                      h−1 at the lower (15cm above the ground) and upper (70cm above the ground) stem positions, respectively. The CH4 concentration was lower in soil gas than in ambient air to a depth of at least 40cm. One possible source of CH4 emitted from the stems might be the dissolved CH4 in groundwater; maximum concentrations were 10,000 times higher than atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Our results suggest that CH4 transport from the submerged soil layer to the atmosphere may occur through internal air spaces in tree bodies.
