A well-documented, publicly available, global data set of surface ocean carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) parameters has been called for by international groups for nearly two decades. The Surface Ocean CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Atlas (SOCAT) project was initiated by the international marine carbon science community in 2007 with the aim of providing a comprehensive, publicly available, regularly updated, global data set of marine surface CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which had been subject to quality control (QC). Many additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; data, not yet made public via the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), were retrieved from data originators, public websites and other data centres. All data were put in a uniform format following a strict protocol. Quality control was carried out according to clearly defined criteria. Regional specialists performed the quality control, using state-of-the-art web-based tools, specially developed for accomplishing this global team effort. SOCAT version 1.5 was made public in September 2011 and holds 6.3 million quality controlled surface CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; data points from the global oceans and coastal seas, spanning four decades (1968&amp;amp;ndash;2007). Three types of data products are available: individual cruise files, a merged complete data set and gridded products. With the rapid expansion of marine CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; data collection and the importance of quantifying net global oceanic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and its changes, sustained data synthesis and data access are priorities.
