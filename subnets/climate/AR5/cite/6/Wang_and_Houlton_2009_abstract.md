Carbon‐climate feedback has been identified as one of the key areas of synthesis for the next Inter‐governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); however, most of the models on which the IPCC will rely are yet to consider vital interactions between nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles. A major impediment to including N limitation in model predictions has been the lack of constraint to rates of N fixation worldwide. Here we use a theoretical framework that considers interactions of C and nutrients to estimate rates of terrestrial N fixation, and thereby examining how the constraints of N on land C uptake and global warming. We show that most global models without nutrient limitations significantly overestimated land C uptake, thus underestimating both the pace and magnitude of the predicted global warming. We suggest that the next IPCC assessment should consider nutrient constraints on carbon‐climate feedback and the pace of global warming.
