Carbon cycle feedbacks will have a direct effect on anthropogenic emissions required to stabilize CO2 in the atmosphere. In this study, I used an intermediate complexity coupled climate-carbon model to quantify allowable CO2 emissions for a series of scenarios leading to CO2 stabilization at levels between 350 and 1000 ppmv. For all scenarios, global temperature did not stabilize over the next several centuries, but rather continued to increase well beyond the point of CO2 stabilization. Furthermore, neither long-term climate change, nor total allowable CO2 emissions, were sensitive to the shape of the CO2 stabilization profile, but only to the final stabilization level. For the 550-stabilization scenario, positive carbon cycle-climate feedbacks required a reduction of annual CO2 emissions throughout the simulation, with a maximum reduction of 2.3 GtC/yr occurring at 2050. Total emissions over the 21st century were 20% lower than those derived from an equivalent simulation without feedbacks. In two additional runs with varied climate sensitivities, emissions consistent with 550-stabilization were reduced by between 190 and 540 GtC over the next 400 yr relative to the no-feedbacks run. Allowable emissions were further reduced in all cases if CO2 increases did not affect future vegetation productivity, as this removed an otherwise important negative feedback on atmospheric CO2.
