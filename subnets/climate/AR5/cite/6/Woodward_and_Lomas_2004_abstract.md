The Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model has simulated the structure and net carbon exchange of vegetation at five sites along the Kalahari transect where there is a strong gradient in precipitation from 299 to 918 mm yr−1. There has been a decline in precipitation of 8 mm yr−1 along the whole of the transect since about 1970. Simulations of vegetation dynamics and structure indicate that this decline has exerted a notable effect on the vegetation, with reductions in woody plant cover at the dry end of the transect and reductions in tree density at the wetter end. These changes were driven primarily by reductions in the net primary production and increased rates of mortality, with rather small impacts of fire.
