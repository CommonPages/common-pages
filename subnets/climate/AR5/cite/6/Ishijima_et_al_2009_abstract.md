Atmospheric N2O concentrationwas observed in the Pacific for the period 1991–2006, using commercial container ships sailing between Japan and North America and between Japan and Australia or New Zealand. The N2O concentration showed a secular increase and interannual variations at all sampling locations, but a seasonal cycle was detectable only at northern high latitudes. The annual mean N2O concentration showed little longitudinal variations (within ± 0.3 ppb) in the northern Pacific, but showed a clear north-south gradient of about 0.8 ppb, with higher values in the Northern Hemisphere. The annual mean N2O was also characterized by especially high values at 30◦N due to strong local N2O emissions and by a steep latitudinal decrease from the equator to 20◦S due to the suppression of interhemispheric exchange of air by the South Pacific Convergence Zone. The N2O growth rate showed an interannual variation with a period of about 3 yr (high-values in 1999 and 2000), with a delayed eastward and poleward phase propagation in the northern and western Pacific, respectively. The interannual variations of the N2O growth rate and soil water showed a good correlation, suggesting that the N2O emission from soils have an important causative role in the atmospheric N2O variation.
