Converting the world's fossil‐fuel onroad vehicles (FFOV) to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV), where the H2 is produced by wind‐powered electrolysis, is estimated to reduce global fossil, biofuel, and biomass‐burning emissions of CO2 by ∼13.4%, NOx ∼23.0%, nonmethane organic gases ∼18.9%, black carbon ∼8% H2 ∼3.2% (at 3% leakage), and H2O ∼0.2%. Over 10 years, such reductions were calculated to reduce tropospheric CO ∼5%, NOx ∼5–13%, most organic gases ∼3–15%, OH ∼4%, ozone ∼6%, and PAN ∼13%, but to increase tropospheric CH4 ∼0.25% due to the lower OH. Lower OH also increased upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric ozone, increasing its global column by ∼0.41%. WHFCV cooled the troposphere and warmed the stratosphere, reduced aerosol and cloud surface areas, and increased precipitation. Other renewable‐powered HFCV or battery electric vehicles should have similar impacts.
