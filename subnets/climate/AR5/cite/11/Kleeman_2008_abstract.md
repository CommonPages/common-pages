A regional air quality model was used to quantify the effect of temperature, humidity, mixing depth, and background concentrations on ozone (O3) and airborne particulate matter during three air quality episodes in California. Increasing temperature with no change in absolute humidity promoted the formation of O3 by +2 to +9 ppb K−1 through increased reaction rates. Increasing temperature with no change in relative humidity increased predicted O3 concentrations by +2 to +15 ppb K−1 through enhanced production of hydroxyl radical combined with increased reaction rates. Increasing mixing depth promoted the formation of O3 in regions with an over-abundance of fresh NO emissions (such as central Los Angeles) by providing extra dilution. Increasing temperature with no change in absolute humidity reduced particle water content and promoted the evaporation of ammonium nitrate at a rate of −3 to −7 μg m−3 K−1. Increasing temperature with no change in relative humidity maintained particle water content and moderated ammonium nitrate evaporation rates to a maximum value of −3 μg m−3 K−1 during warmer episodes and increased ammonium nitrate condensation by +1.5 μg m−3 K −1 during colder episodes. Increasing mixing depth reduced the concentration of primary particulate matter but increased the formation of secondary particulate matter in regions with an over-abundance of fresh NO emissions. O3 transported into California from upwind areas enhanced the formation of particulate nitrate by promoting the formation of N2O5 and HNO3 at night. A 30 ppb increase in background O3 concentrations (roughly doubling current levels) increased maximum PM2.5 concentrations by +7 to +16 μg m−3 even when temperature was simultaneously increased by +5 K with no change in absolute humidity (most unfavorable conditions for nitrate formation).
