Satellite passive-microwave data have been used to calculate and map the                         length of the sea-ice season throughout the Southern Ocean for each year                         1979–99. Mapping the slopes of the lines of linear least-squares fit through                         the 21 years of resulting season-length data reveals a detailed pattern of                         trends in the length of the sea-ice season around the Antarctic continent.                         Specifically, most of the Ross Sea ice cover has, on average over the 21                         years, undergone a lengthening of the sea-ice season, whereas most of the                         Amundsen Sea ice cover and almost the entire Bellingshausen Sea ice cover                         have undergone a shortening of the sea-ice season. Results for the Weddell                         Sea are mixed, with the northwestern portion of the sea having experienced a                         shortening of the sea-ice season but a substantial area in the south–central                         portion of the sea having experienced a lengthening of the ice season.                         Overall, the area of the Southern Ocean experiencing a lengthening of the                         sea-ice season by at least 1day per year over the period 1979–99 is 5.6 ×                             106 km2, whereas the area                         experiencing a shortening of the sea-ice season by at least 1 day per year                         is 46% less than that, at 3.0 × 166                             km2.
