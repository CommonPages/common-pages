Airborne laser altimetry has been used during the past decade to measure the surface elevation of the Greenland ice sheet. These measurements have been made using a scanning laser on a NASA P-3 aircraft which was positioned by differential GPS and flown approximately 500 m above the surface. Flights have been made over major portions of the ice sheet and reflown 5 years later in order to obtain estimates of the rate of overall change of surface elevation. The accuracy with which differential elevations can be made depends upon (a) the GPS positioning accuracy, (b) the instrument calibration accuracy, (c) the stability of the laser and, (d) the accuracy of the aircraft inertial navigation system's estimation of aircraft attitude. Overall, the accuracy of an elevation change estimate is computed to be 8.5 cm over small areas and 7.1 cm when averaged over tens of kilometers as is needed for estimating ice volume changes. This effort supportsÂ±1.4 cm/year resolution for long period surface elevation changes from data acquired which are separated by 5 years. Results of inflight data analyses are consistent with these accuracy estimates.
