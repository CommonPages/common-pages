This study assesses glacier fluctuations on Disko Island (Qeqertarsuaq), central West Greenland, during the 20th century. A total of 247 glaciers, of which 75 are classified as surge-type glaciers, are included, representing about 95% of the glacierized area. Based on expedition accounts and early maps, it is concluded that recession rates were highest during the first half of the century. Between 1953 and 2005, 70% of the glaciers showed recession, 28% remained stationary and 2% experienced overall advance due to glacier surging. The mean recession rate of quiescent surge-type glaciers was 20 ma–1 compared to 8ma–1 for normal glaciers. Identification of changes in glacier length controlled by climate changes is achieved by excluding surge-type glaciers from the dataset. The result indicates that glaciers with ablation areas facing in the arc south to northwest, covering an area above 5 km2 and having a terminus elevation below 800 m are the most climate-sensitive.
