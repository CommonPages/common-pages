We present the first detailed maps of fast ice around East Antarctica (75°E–170°E), using an image correlation technique applied to RADARSAT ScanSAR images from November in 1997 and 1999. This method is based upon searching for, and distinguishing, correlated regions of the ice‐covered ocean which remain stationary, in contrast to adjacent moving pack ice. Within the overlapping longitudinal range of ∼86°E–150.6°E, the total fast‐ice area is 141,450 km2 in 1997 and 152,216 km2 in 1999. Calibrated radar backscatter data are also used to determine the distribution of two fast‐ice classes based on their surface roughness characteristics. These are “smooth” fast ice (−25.4 dB to −13.5 dB) and “rough” fast ice (−13.5 dB to −2.5 dB). The former comprises ∼67% of the total area, with rough fast ice making up the remaining ∼33%. An estimate is made of fast‐ice volume, on the basis of fast‐ice type as a proxy measure of ice thickness and area. Results suggest that although fast ice forms 2–16% of the total November sea ice area for this sector of East Antarctica in 1997 and 1999 (average 8.3% across maps), it may comprise 6–57% of the total ice volume (average ∼28% across maps). Grounded icebergs play a key role in fast‐ice distribution in all regions apart from 150°E–170°E. These are “snapshot” estimates only, and more work is required to determine longer‐term spatiotemporal variability.
