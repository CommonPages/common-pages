The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has been providing high quality observations since its launch in 2002. Over the years, fruitful achievements have been obtained and the temporal gravity field has revealed the ongoing geophysical, hydrological and other processes. These discoveries help the scientists better understand various aspects of the Earth. However, errors exist in high degree and order spherical harmonics, which need to be processed before use. Filtering is one of the most commonly used techniques to smooth errors, yet it attenuates signals and also causes leakage of gravity signal into surrounding areas. This paper reports a new method to estimate the true mass change on the grid (expressed in equivalent water height or surface density). The mass change over the grid can be integrated to estimate regional or global mass change. This method assumes the GRACE‐observed apparent mass change is only caused by the mass change on land. By comparing the computed and observed apparent mass change, the true mass change can be iteratively adjusted and estimated. The problem is solved with nonlinear programming (NLP) and yields solutions which are in good agreement with other GRACE‐based estimates.
