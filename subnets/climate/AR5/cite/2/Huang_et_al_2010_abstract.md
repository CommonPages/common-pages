The Siberian High (SH) is an important part of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and is closely linked to cold surges. Previous studies revealed a pronounced decline in the strength of the SH during the late 20th century accompanied with a coherent decrease in the frequency of cold surges. However, studies using different data sets yielded different behaviour of the trends. Here we examine the interdecadal variations of the SH and cold surges deduced from six modern global reanalysis data sets. Discrepancies in such variations are found between the reanalysis data sets and observations as well as among different reanalysis data sets. Such discrepancies contribute to inconsistent interdecadal variations of the cold surge frequency in different reanalysis data sets. Potential causes of this situation are discussed.
