The warming trend for the entire globe (1850 to 2005) is 0.04°C decade–1. A specific warming period started around 1980 and continues until the present. This warming also occurred in the Baltic Sea catchment, which lies between maritime temperate and continental subarctic climate zones. A detailed study of climate variability and the associated impact on the Baltic Sea area for the period 1958 to 2009 revealed that the recent changes in the warming trend are associated with changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. The number and pathways of deep cyclones changed considerably in line with an eastward shift of the North Atlantic Oscillation centers of action. There is a seasonal shift of strong wind events from autumn to winter and early spring. Since the late 1980s, the winter season (DJFM, i.e. December to March) of the Baltic Sea area has tended to be warmer, with less ice coverage and warmer sea surface temperatures, especially pronounced in the northern parts of the Baltic Sea. There is a tendency for increased cloud cover and precipitation in regions that are exposed to westerlies and less cloud coverage at the leeward side of the Scandinavian Mountains and over the Baltic Sea Basin.
