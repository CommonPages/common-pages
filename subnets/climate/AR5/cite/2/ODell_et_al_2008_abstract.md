This work describes a new climatology of cloud liquid water path (LWP), termed the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) climatology, derived from 18 yr of satellite-based passive microwave observations over the global oceans. The climatology is based on a modern retrieval methodology applied consistently to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) microwave sensors on eight different satellite platforms, beginning in 1988 and continuing through 2005. It goes beyond previously published climatologies by explicitly solving for the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water by providing statistical error estimates, and includes a detailed discussion of possible systematic errors. A novel methodology for constructing the climatology is used in which a mean monthly diurnal cycle as well as monthly means of the liquid water path are derived simultaneously from the data on a 1° grid; the methodology also produces statistical errors for these quantities, which decrease toward the end of the time record as the number of observations increases. The derived diurnal cycles are consistent with previous findings in the tropics, but are also derived for higher latitudes and contain more information than in previous studies. The new climatology exhibits differences with previous observationally based climatologies and is found to be more consistent with the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) than are the previous climatologies. Potential systematic errors of the order of 15%–30% or higher exist in the LWP climatology. A previously unexplored source of systematic error is caused by the assumption that all microwave-based retrievals of LWP must make regarding the partitioning of cloud water and rainwater, which cannot be determined using microwave observations alone. The potentially large systematic errors that result may hamper the usefulness of microwave-based climatologies of both cloud liquid water and especially rain rate, particularly in certain regions of the tropics and midlatitudes where the separation of rain from liquid cloud water is most critical.
