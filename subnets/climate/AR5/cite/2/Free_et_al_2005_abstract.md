A new data set containing large‐scale regional mean upper air temperatures based on adjusted global radiosonde data is now available up to the present. Starting with data from 85 of the 87 stations adjusted for homogeneity by Lanzante, Klein and Seidel, we extend the data beyond 1997 where available, using a first differencing method combined with guidance from station metadata. The data set consists of temperature anomaly time series for the globe, the hemispheres, tropics (30°N–30°S) and extratropics. Data provided include annual time series for 13 pressure levels from the surface to 30 mbar and seasonal time series for three broader layers (850–300, 300–100 and 100–50 mbar). The additional years of data increase trends to more than 0.1 K/decade for the global and tropical midtroposphere for 1979–2004. Trends in the stratosphere are approximately −0.5 to −0.9 K/decade and are more negative in the tropics than for the globe. Differences between trends at the surface and in the troposphere are generally reduced in the new time series as compared to raw data and are near zero in the global mean for 1979–2004. We estimate the uncertainty in global mean trends from 1979 to 2004 introduced by the use of first difference processing after 1995 at less than 0.02–0.04 K/decade in the troposphere and up to 0.15 K/decade in the stratosphere at individual pressure levels. Our reliance on metadata, which is often incomplete or unclear, adds further, unquantified uncertainty that could be comparable to the uncertainty from the FD processing. Because the first differencing method cannot be used for individual stations, we also provide updated station time series that are unadjusted after 1997. The Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for Assessing Climate (RATPAC) data set will be archived and updated at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center as part of its climate monitoring program.
