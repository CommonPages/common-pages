The high Himalayan mountains in the north of India are important sources for generating and maintaining the climate over the entire northern belt of the Indian subcontinent. They also influence extreme weather events, such as the western disturbances over the region during winter. The work presented here describes some current trends in weather and climate over the western Himalaya and suggests some possible explanations in the context of climate change. The work also shows how the special features of Indian orography in the western Himalaya affect climate change in the long term, changing the pattern of precipitation over the region. Data analysis of different ranges of the western Himalaya shows significant variations in temperature and snowfall trends in the past few decades. Possible explanations for the changing climate over the western Himalaya are proposed, in terms of variations in cloudiness. The possible effects of climate change on the number of snowfall days and the occurrences of western disturbances over the western Himalaya are also analysed.
