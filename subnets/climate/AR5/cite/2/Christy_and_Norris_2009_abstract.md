The temperature records of 28 Australian radiosonde stations were compared with the bulk-layer temperatures of three satellite products of The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) for the period 1979–2006. The purpose was to use the satellite data as “reference truth” to quantify the effect of changes in station equipment, software, and operations on the reported upper air temperatures and resulting trends. The products are lower troposphere (LT), midtroposphere (MT), and lower stratosphere (LS). Four periods of significant shifts in temperatures were found in the radiosondes relative to both satellite datasets. In the first two shifts—around 1982/83 and 1987/88—the radiosondes experienced an accumulated LT and MT warming shift of 0.5 K on average. These shifts coincided with equipment changes. If unadjusted for these shifts, the radiosondes report spurious tropospheric warming of almost 0.2 K decade−1. For LS in the first period, there is relative warming but in the second, cooling. If unadjusted, the radiosondes overstate LS cooling by about −0.15 K decade−1. The third (early 1990s) and fourth (1998 LT and MT and 2002 LS) shifts are less robustly connected to changes in the radiosondes. Errors in the construction methodology of the satellite products likely account for at least part of the discrepancies but cannot be attributed with confidence to a specific cause. Having opposite signs in the two periods, the last two discrepancies tend to cancel each other. The net effect of these last two shifts on the overall LT and MT trends of ±0.03 K decade−1 is small.
