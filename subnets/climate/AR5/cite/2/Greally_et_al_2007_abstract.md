Ground‐based in situ measurements of 1,1‐difluoroethane (HFC‐152a, CH3CHF2) which is regulated under the Kyoto Protocol are reported under the auspices of the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) and SOGE (System of Observation of halogenated Greenhouse gases in Europe) programs. Observations of HFC‐152a at five locations (four European and one Australian) over a 10 year period were recorded. The annual average growth rate of HFC‐152a in the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere has risen from 0.11 ppt/yr to 0.6 ppt/yr from 1994 to 2004. The Southern Hemisphere annual average growth rate has risen from 0.09 ppt/yr to 0.4 ppt/yr from 1998 to 2004. The 2004 average mixing ratio for HFC‐152a was 5.0 ppt and 1.8 ppt in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively. The annual cycle observed for this species in both hemispheres is approximately consistent with measured annual cycles at the same locations in other gases which are destroyed by OH. Yearly global emissions of HFC‐152a from 1994 to 2004 are derived using the global mean HFC‐152a observations and a 12‐box 2‐D model. The global emission of HFC‐152a has risen from 7 Kt/yr to 28 Kt/yr from 1995 to 2004. On the basis of observations of above‐baseline elevations in the HFC‐152a record and a consumption model, regional emission estimates for Europe and Australia are calculated, indicating accelerating emissions from Europe since 2000. The overall European emission in 2004 ranges from 1.5 to 4.0 Kt/year, 5–15% of global emissions for 1,1‐difluoroethane, while the Australian contribution is negligible at 5–10 tonnes/year, <0.05% of global emissions.
