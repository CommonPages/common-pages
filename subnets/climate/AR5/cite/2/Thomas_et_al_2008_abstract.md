Globally averaged wind speeds from archived ship reports show an increasing trend since the 1940s, which previous studies attributed to the gradual shift from visually estimated to anemometer‐measured winds, and an increase in mean anemometer height. To test this hypothesis, adjustments to account for these changes were applied to individual ship wind observations in the International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). Annual means calculated from adjusted reports were compared to reanalysis near‐surface winds in consistently well‐sampled regions for the period 1958–2002.
