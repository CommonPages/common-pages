Recent observations and model studies of the earth’s radiative energy balance have focused attention on the earth’s top of atmosphere (TOA) energy balance. This is the balance between the shortwave energy absorbed by the earth, which is represented by a spatially and temporally averaged absorbed flux , and the emitted longwave energy, which is represented by the corresponding averaged emitted flux . The TOA average net flux FN is defined as the difference between the two over the averaged area and time, which may be a local, regional, or global average. A global nonzero net flux represents a measure of imbalance between the energy being absorbed and emitted by the earth for the time interval in question. It is of interest to ask what the natural variability of the net flux might be and whether, during times of climate change, signals of important climate change processes might be detected against this natural background variation; examples of these signals include evidence of ocean heat storage, the effects of El Niño, and the radiative effects of volcanic eruptions. In this paper, the authors review the significance of the net flux, survey the observational evidence from a range of satellite instruments over several decades, and analyze some of the most recent observations from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) program to determine what signals and what natural variability might be expected in the TOA net flux. Based on this analysis, the use of broadband radiation measurements for global climate change studies can be assessed.
