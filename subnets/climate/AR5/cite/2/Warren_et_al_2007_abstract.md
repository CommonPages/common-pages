From a dataset of weather observations from land stations worldwide, about 5400 stations were selected as having long periods of record with cloud-type information; they cover all continents and many islands. About 185 million synoptic reports were analyzed for total cloud cover and the amounts of nine different cloud types, for the 26-yr period 1971–96. Monthly and seasonal averages were formed for day and night separately. Time series of total-cloud-cover anomalies for individual continents show a large decrease for South America, small decreases for Eurasia and Africa, and no trend for North America. The largest interannual variations (2.7%) are found for Australia, which is strongly influenced by ENSO. The zonal average trends of total cloud cover are positive in the Arctic winter and spring, 60°–80°N, but negative in all seasons at most other latitudes. The global average trend of total cloud cover over land is small, −0.7% decade−1, offsetting the small positive trend that had been found for the ocean, and resulting in no significant trend for the land–ocean average. Significant regional trends are found for many cloud types. The night trends agree with day trends for total cloud cover and for all cloud types except cumulus. Cirrus trends are generally negative over all continents. A previously reported decline in total cloud cover over China and its neighbors appears to be largely attributable to high and middle clouds. Global trends of the cloud types exhibit trade-offs, with convective cloud types increasing at the expense of stratiform clouds, in both the low and middle levels. Interannual variations over Europe, particularly of nimbostratus, are well correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation; significant correlations are also found across northern Asia. Interannual variations in many parts of the Tropics are well correlated with an ENSO index. Little correlation was found with an index of smoke aerosol, in seven regions of seasonal biomass burning. In the middle latitudes of both hemispheres, seasonal anomalies of cloud cover are positively correlated with surface temperature in winter and negatively correlated in summer, as expected if the direction of causality is from clouds to temperature.
