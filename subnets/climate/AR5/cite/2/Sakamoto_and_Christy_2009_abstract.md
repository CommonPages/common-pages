A Japanese long-term reanalysis (JRA-25) was completed in 2006 utilizing the comprehensive set of observations from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40). JRA-25 and ERA-40 adopted the same type of assimilation systems: 3DVAR with direct use of satellite sounding radiances. Long-term upper-air thermal tendencies in both reanalyses are examined and compared with the observational deep-layer temperatures of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS). The upper-air temperature tendencies in the reanalyses are significantly different from those of UAH and RSS, and they appear to be influenced by the way the observations of the Television and Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) are used. This study focuses on documenting problems in TOVS assimilation, especially problems in bias corrections used in the reanalyses. Referring to quantitative results in an examination of biases between the reanalyses and raw TOVS observations, this study identifies (i) spurious thermal tendencies derived from transitions in TOVS and in the reanalysis calculation streams, (ii) an excessive enhancement of the tropical water cycle in ERA-40, and (iii) an excessive cooling trend and unstable behavior in the stratospheric temperature in JRA-25. The results of this study suggest that any inconsistencies in TOVS usage can lead to serious inconsistencies in the reanalyses. Therefore, time-consuming efforts to obtain reliable observational information from TOVS are necessary for further progress in reanalyses.
