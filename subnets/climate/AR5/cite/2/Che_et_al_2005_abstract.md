Trends in Chinese global radiation, direct horizontal radiation, diffuse radiation, clearness index, diffuse fraction and percentage of possible sunshine duration for the period 1961–2000 were evaluated based on data for daily surface solar radiation and monthly sunshine duration. Annual means for all six variables were calculated for each station and for China as a whole. Linear regression analysis was used to characterize long‐term annual trends in these variables. Over the latter half of the 20th century, there have been significant decreases in global radiation (−4.5 W/m2 per decade), direct radiation (−6.6 W/m2 per decade), clearness index (−1.1% per decade), and the percentage of possible sunshine duration (−1.28% per decade), but diffuse fraction has increased (1.73% per decade). Although there is some evidence that conditions have improved in the last decade, the consistent spatial and temporal variations of these variables support the theory that increased aerosol loadings were at least partially responsible for the observed decreases in global radiation and direct radiation, the clearness index, and the monthly percentage of possible sunshine duration over much of China.
