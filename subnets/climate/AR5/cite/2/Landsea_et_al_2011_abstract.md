A reanalysis of the Atlantic basin tropical storm and hurricane database (“best track”) for the period from 1921 to 1930 has been completed. This reassessment of the main archive for tropical cyclones of the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico was necessary to correct systematic biases and random errors in the data as well as to search for previously unrecognized systems. The methodology for the reanalysis process for revising the track and intensity of tropical cyclone data has been detailed in a previous paper on the reanalysis. The 1921–30 dataset now includes several new tropical cyclones, excludes one system previously considered a tropical storm, makes generally large alterations in the intensity estimates of most tropical cyclones (both toward stronger and weaker intensities), and typically adjusts existing tracks with minor corrections. Average uncertainty in intensity and track values is estimated for both open-ocean conditions as well as landfalling systems. Highlights are given for changes to the more significant hurricanes to impact the United States, Central America, and the Caribbean for this decade.
