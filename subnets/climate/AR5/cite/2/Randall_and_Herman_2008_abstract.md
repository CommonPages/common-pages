Limited time period running trends are created from various microwave sounding unit (MSU) difference time series between the University of Alabama in Huntsville and Remote Sensing System (RSS) group's lower troposphere (LT) and mid troposphere to lower stratosphere channels. This is accomplished in an effort to determine the causes of the greatest discrepancies between the two data sets. Results indicate the greatest discrepancies were over time periods where NOAA 11 through NOAA 15 adjustments were applied to the raw LT data over land. Discrepancies in the LT channel are shown to be dominated by differences in diurnal correction methods due to orbital drift; however, discrepancies from target parameter differences are also present. Comparison of MSU data with the reduced Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for Assessing Climate radiosonde data set indicates that RSS's method (use of climate model) of determining diurnal effects is likely overestimating the correction in the LT channel. Diurnal correction signatures still exist in the RSS LT time series and are likely affecting the long‚Äêterm trend with a warm bias. Our findings enhance the importance of understanding temporal changes in the atmospheric temperature trend profile and their implications on current climate studies.
