Based on the 1960â€“2009 meteorological data from 559 stations across China, the urbanization effect on the diurnal temperature range (DTR) was evaluated in this study. Different roles of urbanization were specially detected under solar dimming and solar brightening. During the solar dimming time, both urban and rural stations showed decreasing trends in maximum temperature (Tmax) because of decreased radiation, suggesting that the dimming effects are not only evident in urban areas but also in rural areas. However, minimum temperature (Tmin) increased more substantially in urban areas than in rural areas during the dimming period, resulting in a greater decrease in the DTR in the urban areas. When the radiation reversed from dimming to brightening, the change in the DTR became different. The Tmax increased faster in rural areas, suggesting that the brightening could be much stronger in rural areas than in urban areas. Similar trends of Tmin between urban and rural areas appeared during the brightening period. The urban DTR continued to show a decreasing trend because of the urbanization effect, while the rural DTR presented an increasing trend. The remarkable DTR difference in the urban and rural areas showed a significant urbanization effect in the solar brightening time.
