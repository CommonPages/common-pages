An ensemble of seasonal Atlantic hurricane simulations is conducted using The Florida State University/Center for Ocean–Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU–COAPS) global spectral model (Cocke and LaRow) at a resolution of T126L27 (a Gaussian grid spacing of 0.94°). Four integrations comprising the ensembles were generated using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) time-lagged initial atmospheric conditions centered on 1 June for the 20 yr from 1986 to 2005. The sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were updated weekly using the Reynolds et al. observed data. An objective-tracking algorithm obtained from the ECMWF and modified for this model’s resolution was used to detect and track the storms. It was found that the model’s composite storm structure and track lengths are realistic. In addition, the 20-yr interannual variability was well simulated by the ensembles with a 0.78 ensemble mean rank correlation. The ensembles tend to overestimate (underestimate) the numbers of storms during July (September) and produced only one CAT4–level storm on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Similar problems are noted in other global model simulations. All ensembles did well in simulating the large number of storms forming in the Atlantic basin during 1995 and showed an increase in the number of storms during La Niña and a decrease during El Niño events. The results are found to be sensitive to the choices of convection schemes and diffusion coefficients. The overall conclusion is that models such as the one used here are needed to better hindcast the interannual variability; however, going to an even higher resolution does not guarantee better interannual variability, tracks, or intensity. Improved physical parameterizations, such as using an explicit convection scheme and better representation of surface roughness at high wind speeds, are likely to more accurately represent hurricane intensity.
