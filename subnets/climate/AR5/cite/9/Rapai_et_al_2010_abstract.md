The ability of a nested model to accurately simulate the subarctic climate is studied here. Two issues have been investigated: Model’s internal variability (IV) and the impact of domain size (DS). For this purpose we combine the “perfect model” approach, Big-Brother Experiment (BBE) (Denis et al. in Clim Dyn 18:627–646, 2002) with the ensemble of simulations. The advantage of this framework is the possibility to study small-scale climate features that constitute the main added value of RCM. The effects of the DS on result were studied by employing two Little-Brother (LB) domain sizes. IV has been evaluated by introducing small differences in initial conditions in an ensemble of 20 simulations over each LB. Results confirm previous findings that the IV is more important over the larger domain of integration. The temporal evolution over two domain sizes is rather different and depends strongly on the synoptic situation. Small-scales solution over the larger domain diverges freely from the boundary forcing in some periods. Over the smaller domain, the amplitude of small-scale transient eddies is systematically underestimated, especially at higher altitude characterized by the strongest winds along the storm tracks. Over the larger domain, the amplitude of small-scale transient eddies is better represented. However, the weaker control by the lateral boundaries over the larger domain results in solutions with large internal variability. As a result, the ensemble average strongly underestimates the transient-eddy variance due to partial destructive interference of individual ensemble member solutions.
