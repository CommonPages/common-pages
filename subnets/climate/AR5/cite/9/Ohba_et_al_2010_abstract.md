Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multimodel dataset, the relationships between the climatological states and transition processes of simulated ENSO are investigated. The air–sea coupled system of the observed ENSO can remain in the weak cold event for up to 2 yr, whereas those of the warm events tend to turn rapidly into a cold phase. Therefore, the authors separately investigate the simulated transition process of a warm-phase and a cold-phase ENSO in the CMIP3 models. Some of the models reproduce the features of the observed transition process of El Niño/La Niña, whereas most models fail to concurrently reproduce the process during both phases. In the CMIP3 models, four climate models simulate well the rapid transition from El Niño to La Niña. The intensity of a rapid transition of El Niño is mainly related to the intensity of the simulated climatological precipitation over the western–central Pacific (WCP). The models that have strong WCP precipitation can simulate the rapid termination of the equatorial zonal wind in the WCP, which tends to result in the termination of El Niño phase. This relationship is not applicable for the La Niña transition phase. The simulation of La Niña persistency is related to the reflection of off-equatorial Rossby waves at the western boundary of the Pacific and the seasonal evolution of the climatological precipitation in the WCP. Differences in the transition processes between El Niño and La Niña events are fundamentally due to the nonlinear atmospheric (convective) response to SST, which originates from the distribution of climatological SST and its seasonal changes. The results of the present study indicate that a realistic simulation of the climatological state and its seasonality in the WCP are important to be able to simulate the observed transition process of the ENSO.
