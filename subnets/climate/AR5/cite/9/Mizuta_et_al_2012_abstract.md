A new version of the atmospheric general circulation model of the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI), with a horizontal grid size of about 20 km, has been developed. The previous version of the 20-km model, MRIAGCM3.1, which was developed from an operational numerical weather-prediction model, provided information on possible climate change induced by global warming, including future changes in tropical cyclones, the East Asian monsoon, extreme events, and blockings. For the new version, MRI-AGCM3.2, we have introduced various new parameterization schemes that improve the model climate. Using the new model, we performed a present-day climate experiment using observed sea surface temperature. The model shows improvements in simulating heavy monthly-mean precipitation around the tropical Western Pacific, the global distribution of tropical cyclones, the seasonal march of East Asian summer monsoon, and blockings in the Pacific. Improvements in the model climatologies were confirmed numerically using skill scores (e.g., Taylorâ€™s skill score).
