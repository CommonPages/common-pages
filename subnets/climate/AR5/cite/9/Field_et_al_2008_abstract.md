Identical composite analysis of midlatitude cyclones over oceanic regions has been carried out on both output from the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3) and multisensor satellite data. By focusing on mean fields associated with a single phenomenon, the ability of the CAM3 to reproduce realistic midlatitude cyclones is critically appraised. A number of perturbations to the control model were tested against observations, including a candidate new microphysics package for the CAM. The new microphysics removes the temperature-dependent phase determination of the old scheme and introduces representations of microphysical processes to convert from one phase to another and from cloud to precipitation species. By subsampling composite cyclones based on systemwide mean strength (mean wind speed) and systemwide mean moisture the authors believe they are able to make meaningful like-with-like comparisons between observations and model output. All variations of the CAM tested overestimate the optical thickness of high-topped clouds in regions of precipitation. Over a system as a whole, the model can both over- and underestimate total high-topped cloud amounts. However, systemwide mean rainfall rates and composite structure appear to be in broad agreement with satellite estimates. When cyclone strength is taken into account, changes in moisture and rainfall rates from both satellite-derived observations and model output as a function of changes in sea surface temperature are in accordance with the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron equation. The authors find that the proposed new microphysics package shows improvement to composite liquid water path fields and cloud amounts.
