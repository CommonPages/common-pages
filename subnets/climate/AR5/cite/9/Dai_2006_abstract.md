Monthly and 3-hourly precipitation data from twentieth-century climate simulations by the newest generation of 18 coupled climate system models are analyzed and compared with available observations. The characteristics examined include the mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal-to-interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM; version 2.3.2a), produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature (SST) that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal, and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low latitudes, in contrast to 45%-65% in convective form in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to the unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local SST, which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Nino-3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage of the contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm day(-1)), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (> 20 mm day(-1)) and overestimate them for light (< 10 mm day(-1)) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm day(-1) category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America is comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm day(-1)) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in these new models and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of the world's coupled climate models.
