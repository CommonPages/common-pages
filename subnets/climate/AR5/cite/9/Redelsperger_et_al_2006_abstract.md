African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) is an international project to improve our knowledge and understanding of the West African monsoon (WAM) and its variability with an emphasis on daily-to-interannual time scales. AMMA is motivated by an interest in fundamental scientific issues and by the societal need for improved prediction of the WAM and its impacts on West African nations. Recognizing the societal need to develop strategies that reduce the socioeconomic impacts of the variability of the WAM, AMMA will facilitate the multidisciplinary research required to provide improved predictions of the WAM and its impacts. This will be achieved and coordinated through the following five international working groups: i) West African monsoon and global climate, ii) water cycle, iii) surface-atmosphere feedbacks, iv) prediction of climate impacts, and v) high-impact weather prediction and predictability. AMMA promotes the international coordination of ongoing activities, basic research, and a multiyear field campaign over West Africa and the tropical Atlantic. AMMA is developing close partnerships between those involved in basic research of the WAM, operational forecasting, and decision making, and is establishing blended training and education activities for Africans.
