This article presents a novel artificial neural network technique for merging multi-sensor satellite data. Stacked neural networks (NNs) are used to learn the temporal and spatial drifts between data from different satellite sensors. The resulting NNs are then used to sequentially adjust the satellite data for the creation of a global homogeneous long-term climate data record. The proposed technique has successfully been applied to the merging of ozone data from three European satellite sensors covering together a time period of more than 16 years. The resulting long-term ozone data record has an excellent long-term stability of 0.2 Â± 0.2% per decade and can therefore be used for ozone and climate studies.
