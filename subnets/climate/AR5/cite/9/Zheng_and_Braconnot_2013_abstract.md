Simulations of the West African monsoon (WAM) for the present-day climate (0 ka) and the mid-Holocene (6 ka) using the coupled models from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project phase 2 (PMIP2) are assessed in this study. The authors first compare the ensemble simulations with modern observations and proxy estimates of past precipitation, showing that the PMIP2 model median captures the basic features of the WAM for 0 ka and the changes at 6 ka, despite systematic biases in the preindustrial (PI) simulations and underestimates of the northward extent and intensity of precipitation changes. The model spread is then discussed based on a classification of the monsoonal convective regimes for a subset of seven coupled models. Two major categories of model are defined based on their differences in simulating deep and moderate convective regimes in the PI simulations. Changes in precipitation at 6 ka are dominated by changes in the large-scale dynamics for most of the PMIP2 models and are characterized by a shift in the monsoonal circulation toward deeper convective regimes. Consequently, changes in the total precipitation at 6 ka depend on the changes in convective regimes and the characteristics of these regimes in the PI simulations. The results indicate that systematic model biases in simulating the radiation and heat fluxes could explain the damping of the meridional temperature gradient over West Africa and thereby the underestimation of precipitation in the Sahelâ€“Sahara region.
