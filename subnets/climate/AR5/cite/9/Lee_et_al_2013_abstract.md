Wind stress measurements from the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite and two atmospheric reanalysis products are used to evaluate the annual mean and seasonal cycle of wind stress simulated by phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). The ensemble CMIP3 and CMIP5 wind stresses are very similar to each other. Generally speaking, there is no significant improvement of CMIP5 over CMIP3. The CMIP ensemble–average zonal wind stress has eastward biases at midlatitude westerly wind regions (30°–50°N and 30°–50°S, with CMIP being too strong by as much as 55%), westward biases in subtropical–tropical easterly wind regions (15°–25°N and 15°–25°S), and westward biases at high-latitude regions (poleward of 55°S and 55°N). These biases correspond to too strong anticyclonic (cyclonic) wind stress curl over the subtropical (subpolar) ocean gyres, which would strengthen these gyres and influence oceanic meridional heat transport. In the equatorial zone, significant biases of CMIP wind exist in individual basins. In the equatorial Atlantic and Indian Oceans, CMIP ensemble zonal wind stresses are too weak and result in too small of an east–west gradient of sea level. In the equatorial Pacific Ocean, CMIP zonal wind stresses are too weak in the central and too strong in the western Pacific. These biases have important implications for the simulation of various modes of climate variability originating in the tropics. The CMIP as a whole overestimate the magnitude of seasonal variability by almost 50% when averaged over the entire global ocean. The biased wind stress climatologies in CMIP not only have implications for the simulated ocean circulation and climate variability but other air–sea fluxes as well.
