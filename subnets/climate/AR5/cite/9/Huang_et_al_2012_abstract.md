Three ocean general circulation models and a climate model are employed to evaluate the influences of the nonbreaking surface wave–induced mixing on the austral summer (December‐January‐February) mixed layer in the Southern Ocean. These models use either the Mellor‐Yamada turbulence closure scheme or the K profile parameterization scheme. The numerical results show that the nonbreaking surface wave–induced mixing can reduce sea surface temperature and increase subsurface temperature of the upper ocean, which can deepen the upper ocean mixed layer. For these four models, austral summer mixed‐layer depths in the cases with the wave‐induced mixing deepen by 6.2–21.5 m than those without in the Southern Ocean (30°S–65°S), much closer to the observation. These results indicate that incorporation of the wave‐induced mixing can improve the simulation of the austral summer upper mixed layer in the Southern Ocean. Although the responses of four models are different, all simulation results show notable improvements, which may imply that the nonbreaking surface wave–induced mixing is an indispensable physical process for ocean and climate models.
