The mechanism of the tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO) of the ENSO-monsoon system is investigated by an MRI coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. In this mechanism, biennial variability of the South Asian monsoon affects the global scale climate variability through interactions with the air-sea coupled system over the Pacific and/or the extratropical circulation.  In the strong phase of the TBO, the area of relatively strong monsoon convective maximum over South Asia in the spring to summer season moves southeastward to Indonesia in the autumn to winter season. This movement superimposes on its climatological seasonal cycle. It suggests that the northern winter monsoon convection tends to be strong around Indonesia to northern Australia when the summer Asian monsoon is strong. The anomalous state of the air-sea coupled system in the Pacific sector which forms in the summer season, seems to dissipate from its eastern edge. This occurs by a local atmosphere-ocean coupling process through a large scale Walker circulation.  The convection anomalies persist during the entire monsoon season over Indonesia and northern Australia. As a response to this equatorial monsoon convection anomaly, a Matsuno-Gill type stationary Rossby wave is established over the South Asian region. The appearance of upper level anticyclonic circulation and lower level cyclonic circulation anomaly in a strong monsoon year is a favorable condition for bringing the cold air advection over the Eurasian continent. Cold air advection after the strong monsoon persists through the whole winter to spring season to form the cold tropospheric temperature around Central to South Asia. Then reduced land-sea, or north-south temperature contrasts sets up the following weak South Asian summer monsoon. The simulated TBO of the South Asian monsoon is tightly phase locked with a seasonal cycle. The phase of the TBO changes in northern spring, which suggests that the extratropical-tropical interaction be realized mainly during winter to spring through the onset of South Asian monsoon. Our results imply that the TBO is an inherent feature in the land-monsoon-ocean coupled system, and emphasize a more active role of monsoon-extratropical interaction in the Indian sector in winter to spring season for regulating the TBO cycle.
