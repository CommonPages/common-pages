An observational and modeling study is conducted to investigate the structure of the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) during the Atlantic hurricane season, and the relationship between AMM-related SST anomalies and environmental conditions that influence seasonal tropical cyclone activity. The observational analysis shows that during the Atlantic hurricane season the AMM exhibits a similar SST and low-level wind structure as during boreal spring (when the AMM is most active). Observed AMM SST variations are accompanied by air temperature and moisture anomalies that are limited to the boundary layer and an anomalous baroclinic circulation structure in the northern subtropical Atlantic with an anomalous lower-level cyclonic circulation residing under an anomalous upper-level anticyclone during a warm phase. This baroclinic structure contributes to a reduction in vertical wind shear over the tropical Atlantic that is dominated by changes in the upper-level flow. Two sets of model experiments were conducted, in which the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model version 3.1 (CAM3.1) was coupled to a slab ocean model or a data ocean model. In each experiment, the model was either initialized with or forced by AMM-like SST anomalies during boreal summer. The simulations yielded a similar spatial structure to that in the observations, including the baroclinic atmospheric circulation and associated reduction in vertical wind shear. The similarity between the modeled and observed AMM structures strongly suggests a causal relationship in which the AMM-like SST anomalies are responsible for generating environmental conditions that can strongly influence seasonal tropical cyclone variability.
