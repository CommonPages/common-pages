Jang, C. J., Park, J., Park, T., and Yoo, S. 2011. Response of the ocean mixed layer depth to global warming and its impact on primary production: a case for the North Pacific Ocean. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 996–1007.  This study investigates changes in the mixed layer depth (MLD) in the North Pacific Ocean in response to global warming and their impact on primary production by comparing outputs from 11 models of the coupled model intercomparison projects phase 3. The MLD in the 21st century decreases in most regions of the North Pacific, whereas the spatial pattern of the MLD is nearly unchanged. The overall shoaling results in part from intensified upper-ocean stratification caused by both surface warming and freshening. A significant MLD decrease (>30 m) is found in the Kuroshio extension (KE), which is predominantly driven by reduced surface cooling, caused by weakening of wind. Associated with the mixed layer shoaling in the KE, the primary production component resulting from seasonal vertical mixing will be reduced by 10.7–40.3% (ranges of medians from 11 models) via decreased nitrate fluxes from below it. Spring blooms in most models are projected to initiate earlier in the KE by 0–13 d (ranges of medians from 11 models). Despite the overall trends, the magnitude of changes in primary production and timing of spring blooms are quite different depending on models and latitudes.
