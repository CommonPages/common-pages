We describe the long-term stability and mean climatology of oceanic circulations simulated by version 2 of the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System model (FGOALS-s2). Driven by pre-industrial forcing, the integration of FGOALS-s2 was found to have remained stable, with no obvious climate drift over 600 model years. The linear trends of sea SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) were −0.04°C (100 yr)−1 and 0.01 psu (100 yr)−1, respectively.
