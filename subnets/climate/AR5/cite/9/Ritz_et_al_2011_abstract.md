The Bern3D coupled three-dimensional dynamical ocean–energy balance atmosphere model is introduced and the atmospheric component is discussed in detail. The model is of reduced complexity, developed to perform extensive sensitivity studies and ensemble simulations extending over several glacial–interglacial cycles. On large space scales, the modern steady state of the model compares well with observations. In a first application, several 800 000-yr simulations with prescribed orbital, greenhouse gas, and ice sheet forcings are performed. The model shows an increase of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength at glacial inceptions followed by a decrease throughout the glaciation and ending in a circulation at glacial maxima that is weaker than at present. The sensitivity of ocean temperature to atmospheric temperature, Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and Antarctic bottom water (AABW) strength is analyzed at 23 locations. In a second application the climate sensitivities of the modern and of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) state are compared. The temperature rise for a doubling of the CO2 concentration from LGM conditions is 4.3°C and thus notably larger than in the modern case (3°C). The relaxation time scale is strongly dependent on the response of AABW to the CO2 change, since it determines the ventilation of the deep Pacific and Indian Ocean.
