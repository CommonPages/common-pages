Variations of solar total and spectral irradiance are prime solar quantities purported to have an influence on the Earthâ€™s climate. Quantitative estimates of irradiance over as long a time as possible are needed to judge their effectiveness in forcing the climate. In order to do this reliably, first the measured record must be reproduced and a feeling for the physics underlying the irradiance variations must be developed. With the help of this knowledge combined with the available proxy data, reconstructions of irradiance in the past, generally since the Maunder minimum, are attempted. Here a brief introduction to some of the irradiance reconstruction work aiming at irradiance on time scales of days to the solar cycle is given, followed by a brief and incomplete overview of the longer-term reconstructions.
