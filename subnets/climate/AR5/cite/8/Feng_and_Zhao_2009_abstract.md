In order to retrieve from high spectral resolution measurements with high accuracy, it is necessary to be able to evaluate the transmittance precisely. However, the uncertainty of the spectroscopic parameters is one of the most important contributions that affect the accuracy of transmittance. HITRAN is a compilation of spectroscopic parameters which has been updated several times. The transmittance calculations using the line parameters from the HITRAN’2000 database and the HITRAN’2004 database have been compared over the near infrared range from 4200 to 10,000cm−1. The differences between calculated transmittances over this spectral range are mainly caused by changes of the line parameters for H2O, CO2 and CH4. For the tropical atmosphere, the differences are very prominent. Transmittance calculations for the sub-arctic winter atmosphere are less sensitive to the changes in the HITRAN database than those for the tropical atmosphere; but, the changes of line parameters still can not be ignored when considering the relative differences. For example, the relative difference is ∼35% at 5073.3cm−1 with 0.2cm−1 spectral resolution. The comparisons have shown that it is important to pay attention to the changes of line parameters of the HITRAN database or to use the latest edition so as to improve the accuracy of atmospheric sounding with high spectral resolution.
