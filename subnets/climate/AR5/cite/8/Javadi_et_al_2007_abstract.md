Smog chamber/FTIR techniques were used to study the atmospheric chemistry of the title compound which we refer to as RfOC2H5. Rate constants of k(Cl + RfOC2H5) = (2.70 ± 0.36) × 10-12, k(OH + RfOC2H5) = (5.93 ± 0.85) × 10-14, and k(Cl + RfOCHO) = (1.34 ± 0.20) × 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 were measured in 700 Torr of N2, or air, diluent at 294 ± 1 K. From the value of k(OH + RfOC2H5) the atmospheric lifetime of RfOC2H5 was estimated to be 1 year. Two competing loss mechanisms for RfOCH(O•)CH3 radicals were identified in 700 Torr of N2/O2 diluent at 294 ± 1 K; decomposition via C−C bond scission giving a formate (RfOCHO), or reaction with O2 giving an acetate (RfOC(O)CH3). In 700 Torr of N2/O2 diluent at 294 ± 1 K the rate constant ratio kO2/kdiss = (1.26 ± 0.74) × 10-19 cm3 molecule-1. The OH radical initiated atmospheric oxidation of RfOC2H5 gives RfOCHO and RfOC(O)CH3 as major products. RfOC2H5 has a global warming potential of approximately 55 for a 100 year horizon. The results are discussed with respect to the atmospheric chemistry and environmental impact of RfOC2H5.
