Rate coefficients, k, for the gas-phase reaction of the OH radical with (Z)-CF3CH═CHCF3 (cis-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene) were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions in OH using pulsed laser photolysis (PLP) to produce OH and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to detect it. Rate coefficients were measured over a range of temperatures (212–374 K) and bath gas pressures (20–200 Torr; He, N2) and found to be independent of pressure over this range of conditions. The rate coefficient has a non-Arrhenius behavior that is well-described by the expression k1(T) = (5.73 ± 0.60) × 10–19 × T2 × exp[(678 ± 10)/T] cm3 molecule–1 s–1 where k1(296 K) was measured to be (4.91 ± 0.50) × 10–13 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 and the uncertainties are at the 2σ level and include estimated systematic errors. Rate coefficients for the analogous OD radical reaction were determined over a range of temperatures (262–374 K) at 100 Torr (He) to be k2(T) = (4.81 ± 0.20) × 10–19 × T2 × exp[(776 ± 15)/T], with k2(296 K) = (5.73 ± 0.50) × 10–13 cm3 molecule–1 s–1. OH radical rate coefficients were also measured at 296, 345, and 375 K using a relative rate technique and found to be in good agreement with the PLP–LIF results. A room-temperature rate coefficient for the O3 + (Z)-CF3CH═CHCF3 reaction was measured using an absolute method with O3 in excess to be <6 × 10–21 cm3 molecule–1 s–1. The atmospheric lifetime of (Z)-CF3CH═CHCF3 due to loss by OH reaction was estimated to be ∼20 days. Infrared absorption spectra of (Z)-CF3CH═CHCF3 measured in this work were used to determine a (Z)-CF3CH═CHCF3 global warming potential (GWP) of ∼9 for the 100 year time horizon. A comparison of the OH reactivity of (Z)-CF3CH═CHCF3 with other unsaturated fluorinated compounds is presented.
