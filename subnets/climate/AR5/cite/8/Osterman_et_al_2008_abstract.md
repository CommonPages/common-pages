The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) is an infrared, high‐resolution Fourier transform spectrometer which was launched onboard NASA's Aura satellite in 2004 and is providing global, vertically resolved measurements of ozone in the troposphere. TES version 2 (V002) data profiles have been validated in the troposphere and lower stratosphere by way of comparison to ozonesondes and aircraft measurements. TES measurements also have sensitivity throughout the stratosphere, and therefore TES ozone profiles can be integrated to determine the total and stratospheric column in addition to the tropospheric column ozone values. In this work we compare the ozone in the stratosphere measured by TES to observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument in order to show the quality of the TES measurements in the stratosphere. We also compare the determination of a total column value for ozone based on the TES profiles to the column measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The TES tropospheric ozone column value is also calculated from the TES profiles and compared with column values determined from ozonesonde data. Column measurements are useful because the errors are markedly reduced from errors at the profile levels and can be used to assess both biases and quality of the TES ozone retrievals. TES observations of total or partial column ozone compare well with the other instruments but tend toward higher values than the other measurements. Specifically, TES is higher than OMI by ∼10 Dobson units (DU) for the total ozone column. TES measures higher values in the stratosphere (above 100 hPa) by ∼3 DU and measures higher ozone column values (∼4 DU) in the troposphere than ozonesondes. While the strength of the TES nadir ozone product is the vertical resolution it provides in the troposphere, a tropospheric column value derived from TES have utility in analyses using or validating tropospheric ozone residual products.
