Vertical profiles of the CH4 mixing ratio in the troposphere and stratosphere were obtained by collecting air samples and analyzing their CH4 concentrations by gas chromatography. Two sets of tropospheric profiles, each covering a full year, have been measured; one over the Pacific 200 km offshore from Santa Barbara, California, and one over Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Although some of the individual profiles showed large fluctuations with time and space, a systematic seasonal variation of tropospheric CH4 concentration could not be established. On a 1‚Äêyear average, CH4 has a nearly uniform distribution in the troposphere, with an average volume mixing ratio of 1.41 ppmv. The only systematic gradient in the troposphere was observed for the Scottsbluff profiles which showed a decrease in the CH4 mixing ratio close to the ground. In contrast, the stratospheric CH4 profiles showed a systematic decrease with altitude, with a steeper gradient directly above the tropopause. The gradient appears to be weaker at higher altitudes. At 50 km the CH4 mixing ratio has dropped to 0.25 ppmv.
