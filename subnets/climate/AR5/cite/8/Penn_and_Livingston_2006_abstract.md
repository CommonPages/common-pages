We have observed high-resolution intensity spectra near the Fe I 1564.8 nm line at a single umbral point corresponding to the darkest position in over 900 sunspots from 1998 through 2005. From these data we determine that the maximum sunspot magnetic fields have been decreasing at about 52 G yr-1. The same data set shows a concurrent increase in the normalized umbral intensity from 0.60 to 0.75 (corresponding to a blackbody temperature rise from 5137 to 5719 K) and a decrease of more than 50% in the molecular OH line strength. The magnetic field and intensity changes observed over time in the sunspot umbrae from different spots behave in the same way as the magnetic field and intensity changes observed spatially across single sunspots.
