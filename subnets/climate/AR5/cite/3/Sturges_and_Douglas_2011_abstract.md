Variability in sea level at the longest periods observable in modern records has recently been found to be well correlated with local atmospheric pressure. At shorter periods, however, longshore winds are known to be one of the primary mechanisms for forcing sea level variability on the eastern margins of the ocean. There is a remarkable ∼80 mm drop in mean sea level on both the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic coasts between the late 1800s and early 1900s; it is found here to be in agreement with longshore wind forcing from the equator up to the latitude of the observed tide stations. Better‐resolved data beginning in 1960 show that the delay near the annual period between wind forcing and sea level is approximately 1 month. The relative high in sea level in the late 1800s on the west coast of Europe appears to have propagated westward across the Atlantic as a long Rossby wave and then to have been seen on the east coast of the United States. Because many features in long‐term sea level variability are correlated with wind forcing on time scales from annual to decades, it will be prudent to base conclusions about long‐term sea level rise on the longest records available. The results here are based on forcing by longshore winds; the related issue of the extent to which open ocean wind curl may also be responsible is not addressed here, nor the extent to which coastal sea level observations are representative of the open ocean.
