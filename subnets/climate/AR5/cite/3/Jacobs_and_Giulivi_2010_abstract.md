Ocean temperature and salinity measurements on and near the Antarctic continental shelf in the southwest Pacific sector are evaluated for evidence of temporal change. Shelf water in the southwest Ross Sea has declined in salinity by 0.03 decade−1 from 1958 to 2008, while its temperatures have increased in proportion to the influence of salinity on the sea surface freezing point. Modified deep-water intrusions that reach the central Ross Ice Shelf have freshened at a similar rate and cooled by ∼0.5°C since the late 1970s. Salinity has decreased by 0.08 decade−1 in the westward coastal and slope front currents, consistent with increased melting of continental ice upstream in the Amundsen Sea. Overturning of those near-surface waters during winter sea ice formation and mixing across the slope front is sufficient to account for the 5-decade shelf water salinity change. A strong correlation between the freshening and change in the southern annular mode index suggests a link with the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Salinity has decreased by ∼0.01 decade−1 in bottom and lower deep waters north of the continental slope between 140E° and 180°. Accompanying abyssal temperature changes are minor and variability is high, but density has declined along with salinity. Continued increases in water column stratification will modify the mode and formation rate as well as the properties of bottom and deep waters produced in this region.
