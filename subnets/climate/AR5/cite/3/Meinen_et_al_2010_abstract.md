More than forty years of Florida Current transport estimates are combined to study annual and longer-term variability in this important component of the MOC and subtropical gyre. A detailed analysis with error estimates illustrates the difficulties in extracting annual and longer time scale variability given the strong higher frequency energy present. The annual cycle represents less than 10% of the total Florida Current transport variance in a 16yr segment of the record, while interannual (13–42 month) variability represents only 13% of the total and periods longer than 42 months represents less than 10% of the total. Given the observed high frequency variability of the Florida Current, in order to get a monthly mean that is accurate to within 0.5Sv (one standard error level) more than 20 daily observations are needed. To obtain an estimate of the annual climatology that is “accurate” to within 20% of its own standard deviation, at least 24yr of data is needed. More than 40 observations spread throughout a year are required to obtain an annual mean that is accurate to within 0.5Sv. Despite these daunting data requirements, there is sufficient data now to evaluate both the annual cycle of the Florida Current transport with a high degree of accuracy and to begin to determine the longer period transport variability. Comparison of the Florida Current, NAO and wind stress curl records shows that a recently described Sverdrup-based mechanism explains a significant fraction of the long-period variability primarily during the 1986–1998 time window, with other mechanisms clearly dominating before and after.
