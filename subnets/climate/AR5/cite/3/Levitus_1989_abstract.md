We have composited historical hydrographic observations for the world ocean for two pentads, 1955–1959 and 1970–1974, and have objectively analyzed these data for the purpose of studying the temporal variability of temperature and salinity in the North Atlantic Ocean. The subtropical gyre (500–1300 m) of the North Atlantic was colder and fresher during 1970–1974 compared to 1955–1959. The relatively large changes in temperature and salinity on constant‐depth surfaces in the subtropical gyre were due to upward displacements of isopycnal surfaces. At intermediate depths the eastern portion of the subarctic gyre was also colder and fresher during the 1970–1974 pentad. In contrast, the western portion of the subarctic gyre exhibited higher temperatures and salinities during 1970–1974 compared to 1955–1959. Characteristic differences in temperature and salinity for both gyres were 0.5°C and 0.025‰, respectively. Analysis of changes in potential vorticity indicates that in the subtropical gyre potential vorticity increased in all density layers above the 26.5 surface, suggesting that convection in this region may have been shallower in 1970–1974 compared to 1955–1959. Below the 26.5 surface, potential vorticity decreased through the 27.3 surface, indicating that deeper than normal convection may have formed the water masses in these layers. At 250‐m depth, relatively large changes in temperature and salinity occurred along the line of maximum climatological mixed layer depth that extends northeast to southwest across the North Atlantic Ocean.
