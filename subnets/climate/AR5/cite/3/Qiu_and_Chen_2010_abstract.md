Satellite altimeter sea surface height (SSH) data from the past 17 yr are used to investigate the interannual-to-decadal changes in the bifurcation of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) along the Philippine coast. The NEC bifurcation latitude migrated quasi decadally between 10° and 15°N with northerly bifurcations observed in late 1992, 1997–98, and 2003–04 and southerly bifurcations in 1999–2000 and 2008–09. The observed NEC bifurcation latitude can be approximated well by the SSH anomalies in the 12°–14°N and 127°–130°E box east of the mean NEC bifurcation point. Using a 1 ½-layer reduced-gravity model forced by the ECMWF reanalysis wind stress data, the authors find that the SSH anomalies in this box can be simulated favorably to serve as a proxy for the observed NEC bifurcation. With the availability of the long-term reanalysis wind stress data, this helps to lengthen the NEC bifurcation time series back to 1962. Although quasi-decadal variability was prominent in the last two decades, the NEC bifurcation was dominated by changes with a 3–5-yr period during the 1980s and had low variance prior to the 1970s. These interdecadal modulations in the characteristics of the NEC bifurcation reflect similar interdecadal modulations in the wind forcing field over the western tropical North Pacific Ocean. Although the NEC bifurcation on interannual and longer time scales is generally related to the Niño-3.4 index with a positive (negative) index corresponding to a northerly (southerly) bifurcation, the exact location of bifurcation is determined by wind forcing in the 12°–14°N band that contains variability not fully representable by the Niño-3.4 index.
