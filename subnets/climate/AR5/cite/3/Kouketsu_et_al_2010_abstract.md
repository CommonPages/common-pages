We detected temperature (salinity) decreases on the neutral density surfaces above the salinity minimum and increases below throughout the western North Pacific subtropical gyre (                                                                                    25                                                                                       ∘                                                                              N                         –                                                                                    40                                                                                       ∘                                                                              N                      , west of                                                                                     170                                                                                       ∘                                                                              W                      ) by comparing World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic sections from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The temperature (salinity) changes around the salinity minimum were associated with an apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) increase, and could not be explained by an increase of the subpolar input. These property changes were due to a density decrease of the salinity minimum. Furthermore, similar changes in temperature (salinity) were detected along                                                                                     165                                                                                       ∘                                                                              E                       as a 12-year trend from 1996 to 2007. This suggests that the changes evident in the comparison of the WOCE sections are the representative of changes at the intermediate depths in the last decade. This pattern was not detected in the eastern subtropical gyre (                                                                                    25                                                                                       ∘                                                                              N                         –                                                                                    40                                                                                       ∘                                                                              N                      , east of                                                                                     170                                                                                       ∘                                                                              W                      ) and along                                                                                     47                                                                                       ∘                                                                              N                      , where the AOU increase due to ventilation reduction has been reported.
