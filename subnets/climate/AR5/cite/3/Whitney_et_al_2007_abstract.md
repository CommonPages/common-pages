Fifty years of measurements at Ocean Station Papa (OSP, 50°N, 145°W) show trends in the interior waters of the subarctic Pacific that are both impacted by short term (few years to bi-decadal) atmospheric or ocean circulation oscillations and by persistent climate trends. Between 1956 and 2006, waters below the ocean mixed layer to a depth of at least 1000m have been warming and losing oxygen. On density surfaces found in the depth range 100–400m (σ                                               θ                                            =26.3–27.0), the ocean is warming at 0.005–0.012°Cy−1, whereas oxygen is declining at 0.39–0.70μmolkg−1                      y−1 or at an integrated rate of 123mmolm−2                      y−1 (decrease of 22% over 50 years). During this time, the hypoxic boundary (defined as 60μmol O2                      kg−1) has shoaled from ∼400 to 300m. In the Alaska Gyre, the 26.2 isopycnal occasionally ventilates, whereas at OSP 26.0σ                                               θ                       has not been seen at the ocean surface since 1971 as the upper ocean continues to stratify. To interpret the 50 year record at OSP, the isopycnal transport of oxygenated waters within the interior of the subarctic Pacific is assessed by using a slightly modified “NO” parameter [Broecker, W., 1974. “NO” a conservative water-mass tracer. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 23, 100–107]. The highest nitrate–oxygen signature in interior waters of the North Pacific is found in the Bering Sea Gyre, Western Subarctic Gyre and East Kamchatka Current region as a consequence of winter mixing to the ∼26.6 isopycnal. By mixing with low NO waters found in the subtropics and Okhotsk Sea, this signature is diluted as waters flow eastward across the Pacific. Evidence of low NO waters flowing north from California is seen along the coasts of British Columbia and SE Alaska. Oxygen in the subsurface waters of the Alaskan Gyre was supplied ∼60% by subarctic and 40% by subtropical waters during WOCE surveys, whereas such estimates are shown to periodically vary by 20% at OSP. Other features discernable in the OSP data include periods of increased ventilation of deeper isopycnals on an ∼18 year cycle and strong, short term (few month) variability caused by passing mesoscale eddies. The potential impacts of declining oxygen on coastal ecosystems are discussed.
