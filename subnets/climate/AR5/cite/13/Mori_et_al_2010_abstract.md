The influence of global climate change due to greenhouse effects on the earthâ€™s environment will require impact assessment, mitigation and adaptation strategies for the future of our society. This study predicts future ocean wave climate in comparison with present wave climate based on the atmospheric general circulation model and global wave model. The annual averaged and extreme sea surface winds and waves are analyzed in detail. There are clear regional dependences of both annual average and also extreme wave height changes from present to future climates. The wave heights of future climate will increase at both middle latitudes and also in the Antarctic Ocean, with a decrease at the equator.
