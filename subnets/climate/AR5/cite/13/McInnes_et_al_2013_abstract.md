Current climate 1‐in‐100‐year storm tide heights along the coast of Victoria, southeast Australia were estimated by combining probabilities of storm surge and tide heights determined from hydrodynamic modelling. For this return period, levels lie between 1 and 2 m above mean sea level along much of the coastline. Future climate 1‐in‐100‐year storm tide heights were estimated by adding high‐end estimates of future sea‐level rise from recent literature. The effect of climate change through consistent wind‐speed increases was also examined and it was found that, for the late 21st Century, the contribution of wind‐speed increase to the increases in extreme storm surge heights is considerably smaller, by a factor of more than 2, than the contribution of sea‐level rise.
