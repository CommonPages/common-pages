Dating constraints have been combined with an ice-flow model to estimate                   surface accumulation rates at Law Dome, East Antarctica, to approximately 80 kyr                   BP. Results indicate that the present high-accumulation regime                      (~0.7maâ€“1 ice equivalent) was established some time after                   ~7 kyr BP, following an increase of approximately 80% from early to mid-Holocene.                   The accumulation rate at the Last Glacial Maximum is estimated at less than ~10%                   of the modern value. The record reveals an approximately linear dependence between                   temperature (inferred from isotope ratio) and accumulation rate through the                   glacial period. This dependence breaks down in the early Holocene, and this is                   interpreted as a change to a mode in which moisture-transport changes have a                   stronger influence on accumulation than temperature (via absolute humidity). The                   changes in accumulation, including the large change in the early to mid-Holocene,                   are accompanied by changes in sea-salt concentrations which support the hypothesis                   that Law Dome climate has shifted from a glacial climate, more like that of the                   present-day Antarctic Plateau, to its current Antarctic maritime climate. The                   change between these two modes occurred progressively through the early Holocene,                   possibly reflecting insolation-driven changes in atmospheric moisture content and                   circulation.
