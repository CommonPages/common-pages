Holocene relative sea-level data contain information on vertical land movements along coasts and, hence, can provide vital input for predictions of future sea-level change. At Thurlestone, in southwest England, late Holocene coastal sediments were cored and sampled in coastal back-barrier marshes. The presence of a basal sedimentary unit containing salt-marsh microfossils made it possible to obtain precise estimates of late Holocene relative sea-level change from the sediments. This is important because previous studies have suggested that the southwest of England is experiencing the fastest rates of land subsidence in the British Isles. Ten new late Holocene basal sea-level index points fill an important gap in the palaeosea-level data set for southwest England. Another 15 early and middle Holocene sea-level index points are available from previous work. The data show that relative sea level rose by about 10m between 9000 and 7000cal. yr BP and a further 8m in the last 7000yr. In the last 2000yr, relative sea level rose on average by 0.9mm/yr. The coast is currently subsiding by 1.1mm/yr due to ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The Bradley et al. (2009) GIA model, which is used in the United Kingdom to determine land-motion rates for input into future sea-level predictions, underestimates the rate of coastal subsidence by about 0.16mm/yr, but performs better than other models. Our data validate the land-motion rates currently used in regional sea-level projections.
