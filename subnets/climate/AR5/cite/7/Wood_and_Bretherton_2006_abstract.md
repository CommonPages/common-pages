Observations in subtropical regions show that stratiform low cloud cover is well correlated with the lower-troposphere stability (LTS), defined as the difference in potential temperature theta between the 700-hPa level and the surface. The LTS can be regarded as a measure of the strength of the inversion that caps the planetary boundary layer (PBL). A stronger inversion is more effective at trapping moisture within the marine boundary layer (MBL), permitting greater cloud cover. This paper presents a new formulation, called the estimated inversion strength (EIS), to estimate the strength of the PBL inversion given the temperatures at 700 hPa and at the surface. The EIS accounts for the general observation that the free-tropospheric temperature profile is often close to a moist adiabat and its lapse rate is strongly temperature dependent. Therefore, for a given LTS, the EIS is greater at colder temperatures. It is demonstrated that while the seasonal cycles of LTS and low cloud cover fraction (CF) are strongly correlated in many regions, no single relationship between LTS and CF can be found that encompasses the wide range of temperatures occurring in the Tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes. However, a single linear relationship between CF and EIS explains 83% of the regional/ seasonal variance in stratus cloud amount, suggesting that EIS is a more regime-independent predictor of stratus cloud amount than is LTS under a wide range of climatological conditions. The result has some potentially important implications for how low clouds might behave in a changed climate. In contrast to Miller's thermostat hypothesis that a reduction in the lapse rate (Clausius-Clapeyron) will lead to increased LTS and increased tropical low cloud cover in a warmer climate, the results here suggest that low clouds may be much less sensitive to changes in the temperature profile if the vertical profile of tropospheric warming follows a moist adiabat.
