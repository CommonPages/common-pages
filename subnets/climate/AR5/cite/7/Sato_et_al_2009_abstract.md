This study analyzes the diurnal cycle of precipitation simulated in a global cloud-resolving model (GCRM) named the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). A 30-day integration of NICAM successfully simulates the precipitation diurnal cycle associated with the land–sea breeze and the thermally induced topographic circulations as well as the horizontal propagation of diurnal cycle signals. The first harmonic of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the 7-km run agrees well with that from satellite observations in its geographical distributions although its amplitude is slightly overestimated. The NICAM simulation revealed that the precipitation diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent is strongly coupled with the land–sea breeze that controls the convergence/divergence pattern in the lower troposphere around the islands. The analysis also suggests that the cold pool often forms over the open ocean where the precipitation intensity is high, and the propagation of the cold pool events is related to the precipitation diurnal cycle as well as the land–sea breeze. Sensitivity experiments suggest a prominent horizontal resolution dependence of the simulated precipitation diurnal cycle. Over continental areas the 14-km run induces the diurnal peak about three hours later than the 7-km run. The 3.5-km run produces the peak time and amplitude that are very similar to those in Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) observations. Meanwhile, the resolution dependence in phase and amplitude is negligibly small over the open oceans. This contrast sensitivity to the horizontal resolution is attributed to the differences in structure and life cycle of convective systems over land and ocean. Diurnal peaks of precipitable water vapor, precipitation, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are compared over land areas using the NICAM 7-km run. The daily precipitable water vapor maximum appears around 1500 local time (LT), which is followed by the precipitation peak around 1630 LT. The diurnal cycle of high clouds tends to peak around 1930 LT, three hours later than the precipitation peak. These results from NICAM simulations can explain the cause of the phase differences among precipitation products based on several satellite observations. The authors demonstrate that the GCRM is a promising tool for realistically simulating the precipitation diurnal cycle and could be quite useful for studying the role of the diurnal cycle in the climate systems in a global context.
