A bin‐based microphysics scheme for cloud is implemented into a three‐dimensional nonhydrostatic model and off‐line coupled with a global aerosol transport model to reproduce realistic and inhomogeneous condensation nuclei (CN) fields. This coupling makes it possible to calculate cloud microphysical properties over a larger area under more realistic environmental conditions. Using the model, nested grid simulations are performed for two precipitation events associated with transitional synoptic‐scale forcing during the spring over an area of the East China Sea. The nested grid simulations reproduce the general features of the horizontal distributions of variables such as effective droplet radius derived from satellite data retrieval. Comparison of the relationships among simulated cloud variables with those among satellite‐derived variables reveals that the implementation of an inhomogeneous CN field results in a more accurate simulation of the distribution of cloud microphysical properties. Sensitivity tests with respect to CN concentration show that the simulated area and amount of precipitation are slightly affected by the CN concentration. Comparative simulations using bin‐based and bulk microphysical schemes indicate that the difference in cloud microphysics has little effect on precipitation except over the areas of elevated pollution (i.e., elevated CN). Comparison with previous reports indicates that the precipitation response to aerosols is dependent on the environmental conditions and the type of the cloud system.
