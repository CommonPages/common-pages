Three general circulation models (GCMs) are used to analyze the impacts of air–sea coupling and superparameterized (SP) convection on the Asian summer monsoon: Community Climate System Model (CCSM) (coupled, conventional convection), SP Community Atmosphere Model (SP-CAM) (uncoupled, SP convection), and SP-CCSM (coupled, SP). In SP-CCSM, coupling improves the basic-state climate relative to SP-CAM and reduces excessive tropical variability in SP-CAM. Adding SP improves tropical variability, the simulation of easterly zonal shear over the Indian and western Pacific Oceans, and increases negative sea surface temperature (SST) biases in that region. SP-CCSM is the only model to reasonably simulate the eastward-, westward-, and northward-propagating components of the Asian monsoon. CCSM and SP-CCSM mimic the observed phasing of northward-propagating intraseasonal oscillation (NPISO), SST, precipitation, and surface stress anomalies, while SP-CAM is limited in this regard. SP-CCSM produces a variety of tropical waves with spectral characteristics similar to those in observations. Simulated equatorial Rossby (ER) and mixed Rossby–gravity (MRG) waves may lead to different simulations of the NPISO in each model. Each model exhibits some northward propagation for ER waves but only SP-CCSM produces northward-propagating MRG waves, as in observations. The combination of ER and MRG waves over the Indian Ocean influences the spatiotemporal structure of the NPISO and contributes to the differences seen in each model. The role of ocean coupling must be considered in terms of the time scale of the SST response compared to the time scale of tropical variability. High-frequency disturbances experience coupling via its changes to the basic state, while lower-frequency disturbances may respond directly to SST fluctuations.
