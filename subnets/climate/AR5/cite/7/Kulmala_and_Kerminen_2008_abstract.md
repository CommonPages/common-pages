In this paper we summarize recent experimental, theoretical and observational results on the formation and growth of atmospheric nanoparticles. During the last years significant progress has occurred to explain atmospheric nucleation and initial steps of the growth. Due to climatic and health effects of fine and ultrafine particles the formation and growth of new aerosol particles is of growing interest. The question “How and under which conditions does the formation of new atmospheric aerosol particles take place?” has exercised the minds of scientists since the time of John Aitken, who in the late 1880s built the first apparatus to measure the number of dust and fog particles. However, only during the last 15–20 years has the measurement technology developed to such a level that size distributions of nanometer-size particles and concentrations of gases participating in particle formation can be measured in the atmosphere. Also from a theoretical point of view atmospheric nucleation mechanisms have not been resolved: several mechanisms such as ion-induced (or ion mediated) nucleation, ternary and kinetic (barrier-less) nucleation have been suggested. In the most recent theory, the activation of existing neutral and/or ion clusters has been suggested.
