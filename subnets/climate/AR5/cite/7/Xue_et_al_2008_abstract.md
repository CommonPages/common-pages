This study investigates the effects of aerosol on clouds, precipitation, and the organization of trade wind cumuli using large eddy simulations (LES). Results show that for this shallow-cumulus-under-stratocumulus case, cloud fraction increases with increasing aerosol as the aerosol number mixing ratio increases from 25 (domain-averaged surface precipitation rate ∼0.65 mm day−1) to 100 mg−1 (negligible surface precipitation). Further increases in aerosol result in a reduction in cloud fraction. It is suggested that opposing influences of aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation and aerosol-induced enhancement of evaporation are responsible for this nonmonotonic behavior. Under clean conditions (25 mg−1), drizzle is shown to initiate and maintain mesoscale organization of cumulus convection. Precipitation induces downdrafts and cold pool outflow as the cumulus cell develops. At the surface, the center of the cell is characterized by a divergence field, while the edges of the cell are zones of convergence. Convergence drives the formation and development of new cloud cells, leading to a mesoscale open cellular structure. These zones of new cloud formation generate new precipitation zones that continue to reinforce the cellular structure. For simulations with an aerosol concentration of 100 mg−1 the cloud fields do not show any cellular organization. On average, no evidence is found for aerosol effects on the lifetime of these clouds, suggesting that cloud fraction response to changes in aerosol is tied to the frequency of convection and/or cloud size.
