The impacts of enhanced aerosol concentrations such as those associated with dust intrusions on the trimodal distribution of tropical convection have been investigated through the use of large-domain (10 000 grid points), fine-resolution (1 km), long-duration (100 days), two-dimensional idealized cloud-resolving model simulations conducted under conditions of radiativeâ€“convective equilibrium (RCE). The focus of this research is on those aerosols that serve primarily as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The results demonstrate that the large-scale organization of convection, the domain-averaged precipitation, and the total cloud fraction show only show a weak response to enhanced aerosol concentrations. However, while the domainwide responses to enhanced aerosol concentrations are weak, aerosol indirect effects on the three tropical cloud modes are found to be quite significant and often opposite in sign, a fact that appears to contribute to the weaker domain response. The results suggest that aerosol indirect effects associated with shallow clouds may offset or compensate for the aerosol indirect effects associated with congestus and deep convection systems and vice versa, thus producing a more moderate domainwide response to aerosol indirect forcing. Finally, when assessing the impacts of aerosol indirect forcing associated with CCN on the characteristics of tropical convection, several aspects need to be considered, including which cloud mode or type is being investigated, the field of interest, and whether localized or systemwide responses are being examined.
