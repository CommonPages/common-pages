New parameterizations of contact freezing and immersion freezing in stratiform mixed-phase clouds (with temperatures between 0° and −35°C) for black carbon and mineral dust assumed to be composed of either kaolinite (simulation KAO) or montmorillonite (simulation MON) are introduced into the ECHAM4 general circulation model. The effectiveness of black carbon and dust as ice nuclei as a function of temperature is parameterized from a compilation of laboratory studies. This is the first time that freezing parameterizations take the chemical composition of ice nuclei into account. The rather subtle differences between these sensitivity simulations in the present-day climate have significant implications for the anthropogenic indirect aerosol effect. The decrease in net radiation in these sensitivity simulations at the top of the atmosphere varies from 1 ± 0.3 to 2.1 ± 0.1 W m−2 depending on whether dust is assumed to be composed of kaolinite or montmorillonite. In simulation KAO, black carbon has a higher relevancy as an ice nucleus than in simulation MON, because kaolinite is not freezing as effectively as montmorillonite. In simulation KAO, the addition of anthropogenic aerosols results in a larger ice water path, a slightly higher precipitation rate, and a reduced total cloud cover. On the contrary, in simulation MON the increase in ice water path is much smaller and globally the decrease in precipitation is dominated by the reduction in warm-phase precipitation due to the indirect cloud lifetime effect.
