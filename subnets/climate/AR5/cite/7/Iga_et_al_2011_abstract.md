The relationship between upper-tropospheric ice cloud properties and the Hadley circulation intensity is examined through parameter sensitivity studies of global cloud-system-resolving simulations with explicit cloud convection. Experiments under a perpetual July condition were performed by changing parameters in the boundary layer and cloud microphysics schemes, with a mesh size of approximately 14 km. One additional experiment with a mesh size of approximately 7 km was also conducted. These experiments produced a variety of upper-cloud coverage and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) distributions. The authors found that, as the upper-cloud coverage increased, the total precipitation decreased and the intensity of the Hadley circulation weakened because of energy balance constraints that radiative cooling are balanced by adiabatic warming. Interestingly, the ice water path was not correlated with the upper ice-loud coverage or OLR, indicating that the spatial coverage of upper ice clouds, rather than the ice water content, was the key factor in the radiation budget.
