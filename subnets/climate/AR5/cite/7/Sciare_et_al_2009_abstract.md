Long‐term observations of carbonaceous aerosols in the Austral Ocean are reported here for the first time from almost 5 years of continuous filter sampling performed at Amsterdam Island (37°48′S, 77°34′E). Black carbon concentrations determined by optical method were among the lowest reported for marine atmosphere, with monthly mean levels ranging from 2–5 ng C/m3 during summer to 7–13 ng C/m3 during winter. A clear seasonal pattern was also observed for organic aerosols, but in opposite phase, with maximum values during the austral summer period (>250 ng C/m3) and minimum concentrations (100 ng C/m3) during winter. This seasonal variation of organic concentration was found to be almost entirely related to the water‐insoluble organic carbon fraction, suggesting a primary origin for these organics, most probably through bubble bursting processes. Moreover, this summer maximum observed for organic aerosols was found to be correlated with satellite‐derived chlorophyll a concentrations averaged over an oceanic region upwind of the sampling site and characterized by relatively high biogenic activity. This oceanic region being located at 1000–2000 km far away from the monitoring station, atmospheric ageing may have played a significant role on the levels and size‐resolved properties of marine organics collected at Amsterdam Island. This biogenic marine organic source of primary origin in the Austral Ocean is fully consistent with similar observations previously reported for the Northern Atlantic Ocean and brings further evidences of the major role of marine organic emissions over remote oceanic regions.
