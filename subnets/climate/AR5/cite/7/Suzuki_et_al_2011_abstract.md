This study examines the warm rain formation process in global and regional cloud-resolving models. Methodologies developed to analyze CloudSat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations are employed to investigate the cloud-to-precipitation processes and are applied to model results for comparisons with corresponding statistics from the observations. Three precipitation categories of no precipitation, drizzle, and rain are defined according to nonattenuated near-surface radar reflectivity, and their fractional occurrences and the probability of precipitation are investigated as a function of cloud properties such as droplet size, optical thickness, droplet number concentration, and liquid water path. The comparisons reveal how the models are qualitatively similar to, but quantitatively different from, observations in terms of cloud-to-rainwater conversion processes. Statistics from one model reveal a much faster formation of rain than observed, with drizzle occurrence being much less frequent, whereas statistics from the other model illustrate rain formation closer to satellite observations but still faster formation of drizzle water. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity that are rescaled as a function of in-cloud optical depth and classified according to particle size are also compared. The results show that each model indicates systematically faster formation of rain and drizzle, respectively, than observed in vertical profiles although they indicate that the cloud-to-rain transitions are qualitatively similar to observations. These results characterize the model behavior in terms of warm cloud microphysics and then point to a possible area of model improvement for more realistic representation of warm rain formation processes.
