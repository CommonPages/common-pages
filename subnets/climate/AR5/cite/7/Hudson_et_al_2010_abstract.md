More than 140 supercooled clouds were compared with corresponding out-of-cloud cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements. In spite of significant differences in altitude, temperature, distances from cloud base, updraft velocity (W), entrainment, and so on, the correlation coefficients (R) between droplet and CCN concentrations were substantial although not as high as those obtained in warm clouds with less variability of nonaerosol influences. CCN at slightly lower altitudes than the clouds had higher R values than CCN measured at the same altitude. Ice particle concentrations appeared to reduce droplet concentrations and reduce R between CCN and droplet concentrations, but only above 6-km altitude and for temperatures below −20°C. Although higher CCN concentrations generally resulted in higher droplet concentrations, increases in droplet concentrations were generally less than the increases in CCN concentrations. This was apparently due to the expected lower cloud supersaturations (S) when CCN concentrations are higher as was usually the case at lower altitudes. Cloud supersaturations showed more variability at higher altitudes and often very high values at higher altitudes. The use of liquid water content rather than droplet concentrations for cloud threshold resulted in higher R between CCN and droplet concentrations. The same R pattern for cumulative droplet–CCN concentrations as a function of threshold droplet sizes as that recently uncovered in warm clouds was found. This showed R changing rapidly from positive values when all cloud droplets were considered to negative values for slightly larger droplet size thresholds. After reaching a maximum negative value at intermediate droplet sizes, R then reversed direction to smaller negative or even positive values for larger cloud droplet size thresholds. This R pattern of CCN concentrations versus cumulative droplet concentrations for increasing size thresholds is consistent with adiabatic model predictions and thus suggests even greater CCN influence on cloud microphysics.
