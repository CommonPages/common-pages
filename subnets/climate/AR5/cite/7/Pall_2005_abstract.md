Recently some correlations between low cloud cover and solar activity have been reported in the literature. In this paper we show how the flux of GCR is found to correlate positively with the low clouds and negatively with higher clouds, supporting previous theoretical predictions linking atmospheric ionization by cosmic rays and cloud cover at different altitudes. All these correlations are however only marginally significant and the only strongly significant (negative) correlation is found between low and higher cloud layers. Thus, there is strong evidence that the solar‐like variability in low cloud may be artificially induced by the satellite observing perspective.
