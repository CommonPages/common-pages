A global coupled ocean‐atmosphere modeling system is applied in a transient climate simulation to study the response to global warming of Dimethylsulfide (DMS) in the ocean, the DMS flux to the atmosphere, and the resulting DMS concentrations in the atmosphere. The DMS production and consumption processes in the ocean are linked to plankton dynamics simulated in the marine biogeochemistry model HAMOCC5.1, embedded in an ocean general circulation model (MPI‐OM). The atmospheric model ECHAM5 is extended by the microphysical aerosol model HAM, treating the sulfur chemistry in the atmosphere and the evolution of microphysically interacting internally and externally mixed aerosol populations. For future conditions (2000–2100) we assume greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions according to the SRES A1B scenario. We analyzed the results in terms of simulated changes between the period 1861–1890 and 2061–2090. For the global annual mean DMS sea surface concentration and the DMS flux we found a reduction by 10%. The DMS burden in the atmosphere is reduced by only 3%, owing to a longer lifetime of DMS in the atmosphere in a warmer climate (+7%). Regionally the response and the underlying mechanisms are quite inhomogeneous. The largest reduction in the DMS sea surface concentration is simulated in the Southern Ocean (−40%) caused by an increase in the summer mixed layer depth, leading to less favorable light conditions for phytoplankton growth. In the mid and low latitudes DMS sea surface concentrations are predominantly reduced due to nutrient limitation of the phytoplankton growth through higher ocean stratification and less transport of nutrients into the surface layers.
