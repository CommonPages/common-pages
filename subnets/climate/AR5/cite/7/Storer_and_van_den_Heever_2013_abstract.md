This study investigates the effects of aerosols on tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs). A series of large-scale, two-dimensional cloud-resolving model simulations was completed, differing only in the concentration of aerosols available to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Polluted simulations contained more DCCs, wider storms, higher cloud tops, and more convective precipitation domainwide. Differences in warm cloud microphysics were largely consistent with the first and second aerosol indirect effects. The average surface precipitation produced in each DCC column decreased with increasing aerosol concentration. A detailed microphysical budget analysis showed that the reduction in collision and coalescence largely dominated the trend in average precipitation. The production of rain from ice, though it also decreased, became a more important contribution to precipitation as the aerosol concentration increased. The DCCs in polluted simulations contained more frequent extreme values of vertical velocity, but the average updraft speed decreased with increasing aerosols in DCCs above 6 km. An examination of the buoyancy term of the vertical velocity equation demonstrates that the drag associated with condensate loading is an important factor in determining the average updraft strength. The largest contributions to latent heating in DCCs were cloud nucleation and vapor deposition onto water and ice, but changes in latent heating were, on average, an order of magnitude smaller than those in the condensate loading term. The average updraft speed was largely affected by increased drag from condensate loading in more mature updrafts, while early storm updrafts experienced convective invigoration from increased latent heating.
