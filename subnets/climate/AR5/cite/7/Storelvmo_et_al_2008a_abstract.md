A new treatment of mixed-phase cloud microphysics has been implemented in the general circulation model, Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)-Oslo, which combines the NCAR CAM2.0.1 and a detailed aerosol module. The new treatment takes into account the aerosol influence on ice phase initiation in stratiform clouds with temperatures between 0° and −40°C. Both supersaturation and cloud ice fraction, that is, the fraction of cloud ice compared to the total cloud water in a given grid box, are now determined based on a physical reasoning in which not only temperature but also the ambient aerosol concentration play a role. Included in the improved microphysics treatment is also a continuity equation for ice crystal number concentration. Ice crystal sources are heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing processes and ice multiplication. Sink terms are collection processes and precipitation formation, that is, melting and sublimation. Instead of using an idealized ice nuclei concentration for the heterogeneous freezing processes, a common approach in global models, the freezing processes are here dependent on the ability of the ambient aerosols to act as ice nuclei. Additionally, the processes are dependent on the cloud droplet number concentration and hence the aerosols’ ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Sensitivity simulations based on the new microphysical treatment of mixed-phase clouds are presented for both preindustrial and present-day aerosol emissions. Freezing efficiency is found to be highly sensitive to the amount of sulphuric acid available for ice nuclei coating. In the simulations, the interaction of anthropogenic aerosols and freezing mechanisms causes a warming of the earth–atmosphere system, counteracting the cooling effect of aerosols influencing warm clouds. The authors find that this reduction of the total aerosol indirect effect amounts to 50%–90% for the specific assumptions on aerosol properties used in this study. However, many microphysical processes in mixed-phase clouds are still poorly understood and the results must be interpreted with that in mind.
