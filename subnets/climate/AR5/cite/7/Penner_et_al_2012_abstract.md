Satellite‐based estimates for the aerosol indirect forcing are consistently smaller than those from models due, in part, to the use of present‐day results that do not capture the temporal changes between present day and pre‐industrial conditions. Here, we use results from a coupled aerosol‐climate model to pick regions and seasons that are sufficiently pristine to represent pre‐industrial conditions. Then we use results from MODIS and CERES to estimate the forcing between present and pre‐industrial conditions. The estimated forcing in the North Pacific Ocean region ranges from −1.8 to −2.2 Wm−2 from observations. This range is similar to our modeled forcing for this region, −2.65 Wm−2, but is smaller than the modeled forcing using the same methodology as that used with the satellite observations, −3.6 W/m2. Nevertheless, a previous estimate based on satellite observations was a factor of 10 smaller, −0.2 to −0.5 Wm−2. Results demonstrate that while the estimated forcing from models may be somewhat larger than estimates based on satellite data, a judicious choice of analysis methods, yields results that are much closer than previous satellite and model‐based comparisons.
