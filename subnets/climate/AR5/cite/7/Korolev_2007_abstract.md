Phase transformation and precipitation formation in mixed-phase clouds are usually associated with the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process in which ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid droplets. The evolution of mixed-phase clouds, however, is closely related to local thermodynamical conditions, and the WBF process is just one of three possible scenarios. The other two scenarios involve simultaneous growth or evaporation of liquid droplets and ice particles. Particle evolution in the other two scenarios differs significantly from that associated with the WBF process. Thus, during simultaneous growth, liquid droplets compete for the water vapor with the ice particle, which slows down the depositional growth of ice particles instead of promoting their growth at the expense of the liquid as in the WBF process. It is shown that the WBF process is expected to occur under a limited range of conditions and that ice particles and liquid droplets in mixed-phase clouds are not always processed in accordance with the WBF mechanism.
