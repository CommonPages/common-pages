Analyses of tropical cyclones created in an idealized environment reveal how and why cloud microphysical assumptions can influence storm motion, including speed and direction. It is well known that in the absence of a mean flow, a leading factor in storm propagation is the establishment of “beta gyres” owing to planetary vorticity advection by the storm’s circulation. Previous research demonstrated that tangential winds well beyond the core influence storm motion by helping to determine the gyres’ orientation and intensity. Microphysical assumptions, especially involving average particle fall speeds, can strongly influence the winds at outer radius. More specifically, microphysics modulates the radial distribution of column-average virtual temperature, which largely determines the radial surface pressure gradient and therefore the winds because they tend to be in gradient balance beyond the core. Microphysics schemes can differ markedly with respect to average fall speed, depending on the complexity of the scheme and how interactions among condensation types are handled. Average fall speed controls the outward movement of particles produced in the eyewall into the anvil, where they can influence the environment through cloud–radiative interactions and phase changes. With the assistance of some special sensitivity tests, the influence of microphysics and fall speed on radial temperature gradients, leading to different outer wind strengths and tracks, is shown. Among other things, this work demonstrates that the treatment of outer rainbands in operational models can potentially influence how simulated storms move, thus affecting position forecasts.
