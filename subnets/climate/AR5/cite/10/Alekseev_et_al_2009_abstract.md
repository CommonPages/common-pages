The shrinking of the area occupied by sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere accelerated at the end of the 1990s, when the record minima of the summer area were successively noted, and its absolute minimum was observed in September 2007. Such a radical decrease is ahead of the projections of global models and provokes interest in the reliability of model calculations of the future of Arctic sea ice. The results of an analysis of the relation between the warming in the Arctic and the ice extent shrinkage from data of observations and modeling by an ensemble of global climate models are presented.
