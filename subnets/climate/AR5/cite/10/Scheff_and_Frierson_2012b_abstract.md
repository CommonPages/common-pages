Robust subtropical precipitation declines have been a prominent feature of general circulation model (GCM) responses to future greenhouse warming. Recent work by the authors showed that for the models making up the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3), this drying was found mainly in the midlatitude‐driven precipitation poleward of the model subtropical precipitation minima. Here, using more comprehensive diagnostics, we extend that work to 36 new CMIP5 models, and find that CMIP5 robust precipitation declines are also found mainly between subtropical minima and midlatitude precipitation maxima, implicating dynamic poleward expansion of dry zones rather than thermodynamic amplification of dry‐wet contrasts. We also give the full seasonal cycle of these projected declines, showing that they are much more widespread in local spring than in local fall, and that for most of the year in the Northern Hemisphere they are entirely confined to the Atlantic side of the globe.
