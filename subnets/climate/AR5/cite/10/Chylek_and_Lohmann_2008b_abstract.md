In our recent publication [Chylek and Lohmann, 2008] (hereafter referred to as CL08), we have presented an estimate of aerosol forcing and climate sensitivity based on Vostok ice core data [Petit et al., 1999] for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to Holocene transition. The novel feature of our analysis was the use of a cooling from a warm period about 42,000 years ago (or 48,000 depending on the time scale used) to the LGM together with the warming from the LGM to Holocene. The use of these two period together provided an additional constrain of the aerosol radiative forcing, and consequently the aerosol radiative forcing from the LGM to Holocene transition was obtained from the data rather than from the modeling as has been done in the past. Our results suggest the aerosol radiative forcing for the LGM to Holocene transition to be 3.3 ± 0.8 W/m2 and the climate sensitivity to be between 0.36 and 0.68 K/Wm−2 (yielding a global temperature increase between 1.3 and 2.3 K for doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration). For comparison the IPCC report suggests the temperature range for CO2 doubling to be between 2 and 4.5 K (with 60% probability), with values below 1.5 K very unlikely. Thus our result supports the lower end of the IPCC suggested values.
