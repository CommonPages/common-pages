Chylek and Lohmann [2008] (hereafter referred to as CL08) recently presented a new estimate of climate sensitivity (CS) based on analysis of a single paleo‐climate record (Vostok ice core). CL08 inferred a narrow range of climate sensitivities (1.3–2.3°C) which essentially lies below 90% of the CS range given in the last IPCC report (2.0–4.5°C, [Meehl et al., 2007]). Moreover, CL08 claimed a much higher confidence in the range of uncertainties than that stated in the latest IPCC report (95% as given by CL08 versus 66% in IPCC report). In addition, CL08 estimated aerosol forcing during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to be 3.3 ± 0.8 W/m2, which is well above previous estimates. Here we show that both the low CS and high aerosol forcing estimated by CL08 crucially depend on the authors' choice of uncertainty ranges for several key characteristics, as well as a number of assumptions which are hard to justify. In the following we demonstrate that CL08 strongly underestimate related uncertainties and therefore the method used by CL08 does not provide meaningful constraints on the range of climate sensitivity and LGM aerosol forcing.
