The Arctic is a unique and important environment, central to the dynamics and evolution of the Earth system. While the region is inherently a dynamic system, as demonstrated repeatedly by rapid shifts throughout the paleo record, there is mounting evidence that it is experiencing an unprecedented degree of environmental change today [SEARCH SSC, 2001]. This change is closely linked to the freshwater cycle (Hinzman et al. [2005] among many other studies): broad‐scale increases in air temperature, rapid gains/losses in lake area associated with permafrost degradation, major “greening” and geographic shifts in vegetation, reductions in seasonal sea ice cover, melting of glaciers, thawing of permafrost, changing river flows, lengthened ice‐free period in lakes and rivers, and diminished snow cover. There is also concern that recently observed increases in freshwater supply to the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic could reduce thermohaline circulation and potentially trigger an abrupt climate response. While our understanding of this complex system is improving, the sources, geographic distribution, and ultimate consequences of these many changes are still poorly understood over past, contemporary, and future time frames.
