Climate change associated with recent global warming is most prominent in the Arctic and subarctic. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a dominant atmospheric phenomenon in the Northern Hemisphere. Decadal variability of surface air temperature (SAT) associated with the AO index shows high correlation with recent global warming trend. In this study, the SAT variability in the Northern Hemisphere is separated in contributions from decadal variability by the AO and remaining components.                   The results indicate that the decadal variability of the AO index shows high correlation with the SAT variation until 1990. The AO index and SAT variabilities show a negative trend during 1949–1969, while the trend is positive during 1969–1989. In addition, the spatial distribution pattern of the SAT linear trend during each period shows the same pattern as AO. However, while the AO index indicates a negative trend, the SAT trend is continuously positive also after 1990. This warming pattern appearing after 1990 is caused by the Arctic amplification.                   Although the AO has a large amplitude on local scale, the AO is almost dynamically orthogonal to the hemispheric warming component. However, the AO can be related to the decadal variability of the Arctic and subarctic temperature change through the feedbacks by climate sub-systems.
