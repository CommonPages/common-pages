Four long-term time series of seasonal mass-balance observations, all starting in 1914, have been compiled for two stakes on Claridenfirn and one stake on Grosser Aletschgletscher and Silvrettagletscher, Switzerland. These data represent the longest records of mass balance worldwide. A mass-balance model based on the temperature-index approach is used to correct field data for varying observation dates and data gaps and to separate accumulation and ablation. The homogenized continuous 93 year time series cover most of the 20th century and enable us to investigate temporal, regional and altitudinal variability in mass balance and changes in the climatic forcing on glaciers. A high-altitude site shows summer balance trends opposite to those at three stakes located near the equilibrium line. Since 1975, melt rates have increased by 10%(10 a)                   −                                1 periods of enhanced climatic forcing are detected: 1943–53 and 1987–2007. The energy consumed for melt was higher in the 1940s despite lower air temperatures compared to the years since 1987. We find evidence for a change in the glacier surface heat budget, which has important implications for the long-term stability of degree-day factors in empirical temperature-index modelling.
