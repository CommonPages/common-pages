title: 10.5.1.1 - Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice

The Arctic {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere} shows large observed changes over the last decade as noted in {Chapters.4 Chapter 4} and many of these shifts are indicators of major regional and global {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} processes ({cite.10.'Kattsov_et_al_2010}). An assessment of sea ice models‘ capacity to simulate Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent is given in {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3}. Of principal importance is ‘Arctic Amplification’ (see {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}) where {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} in the Arctic are increasing faster than elsewhere in the world.

The rate of decline of Arctic sea ice thickness and September sea ice extent has increased considerably in the first decade of the 21st century ({cite.10.'Maslanik_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Nghiem_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Comiso_and_Nishio_2008}; {cite.10.'Deser_and_Teng_2008}; {cite.10.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Alekseev_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Comiso_2012}; {cite.10.'Polyakov_et_al_2012}). Based on a sea ice {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} and verified by ice thickness estimates from satellite sensors, it is estimated that three quarters of summer Arctic sea ice volume has been lost since the 1980s ({cite.10.'Schweiger_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Maslowski_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Laxon_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Overland_and_Wang_2013}). There was also a rapid reduction in ice extent, to 37% less in September 2007 and to 49% less in September 2012 relative to the 1979–2000 climatology ({'Figure_4_11 Figure 4.11}, {Chapters.4.4_2.4_2_2 Section 4.2.2}). Unlike the loss record set in 2007 that was dominated by a major shift in climatological winds, sea ice loss in 2012 was more due to a general thinning of the sea ice ({cite.10.'Lindsay_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Wang_et_al_2009a}; {cite.10.'Zhang_et_al_2013}). All recent years have ice extents that fall at least two standard deviations below the long-term sea ice {Glossary.*Trend trend}.

The amount of old, thick multi-year sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by 50% from 2005 through 2012 ({cite.10.'Giles_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Kwok_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Kwok_and_Untersteiner_2011} and Figures {'Figure_4_13 4.13} and {'Figure_4_14 4.14}). {Glossary.*Sea_ice Sea ice} has also become more mobile ({cite.10.'Gascard_et_al_2008}). We now have seven years of data that show sea ice conditions are substantially different to that observed prior to 2006. The relatively large increase in the percentage of first year sea ice across the Arctic basin can be considered ‘a new normal.’

Confidence in {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} of change comes in part from the consistency of {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence}. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, evidence has continued to accumulate from a range of observational studies that systematic changes are occurring in the Arctic. Persistent trends in many Arctic variables, including sea ice, the timing of spring snow melt, increased shrubbiness in tundra regions, changes in {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost}, increased area of {Glossary.*Forest forest} fires, changes in ecosystems, as well as Arctic-wide increases in air temperatures, can no longer be associated solely with the dominant {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation, Pacific North American pattern or Atlantic Meridional Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}) ({cite.10.'Quadrelli_and_Wallace_2004}; {cite.10.'Vorosmarty_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Overland_2009}; {cite.10.'Brown_and_Robinson_2011}; {cite.10.'Mahajan_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Oza_et_al_2011a}; {cite.10.'Wassmann_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Nagato_and_Tanaka_2012}). {cite.10.'Duarte_et_al_2012 Duarte et al. (2012)} completed a meta-analysis showing evidence from multiple indicators of detectable climate change signals in the Arctic.

The increase in the magnitude of recent Arctic temperature and decrease in sea ice volume and extent are hypothesized to be due to coupled Arctic amplification mechanisms ({cite.10.'Serreze_and_Francis_2006}; {cite.10.'Miller_et_al_2010}). These feedbacks in the Arctic climate system suggest that the Arctic is sensitive to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} (Mahlstein and Knutti, 2012 ). Historically, changes were damped by the rapid formation of sea ice in autumn causing a negative feedback and a rapid seasonal cooling. But recently, the increased mobility and loss of multiyear sea ice, combined with enhanced heat storage in the sea ice-free regions of the Arctic Ocean form a connected set of processes with positive feedbacks causing an increase in Arctic temperatures and a decrease in sea ice extent ({cite.10.'Manabe_and_Wetherald_1975}; {cite.10.'Gascard_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Serreze_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Stroeve_et_al_2012a}, 2012b) . In addition to the well known ice {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} feedback where decreased sea ice cover decreases the amount of {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} reflected from the surface, there is a late summer/early autumn positive ice insulation feedback due to additional ocean heat storage in areas previously covered by sea ice ({cite.10.'Jackson_et_al_2010}). Arctic amplification may also have a contribution from poleward heat transport in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and ocean ({cite.10.'Langen_and_Alexeev_2007}; {cite.10.'Graversen_and_Wang_2009}; {cite.10.'Doscher_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Yang_et_al_2010}).

It appears that recent Arctic changes are in response to a combination of global-scale warming, from warm anomalies from internal climate variability on different time scales, and are amplified from the multiple feedbacks described above. For example, when the 2007 sea ice minimum occurred, Arctic temperatures had been rising and sea ice extent had been decreasing over the previous two decades ({cite.10.'Stroeve_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Screen_and_Simmonds_2010}). Nevertheless, it took unusually persistent southerly winds along the dateline over the summer months to initiate the sea ice loss event in 2007 ({cite.10.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Wang_et_al_2009b}). Similar southerly wind patterns in previous years did not initiate major reductions in sea ice extent because the sea ice was too thick to respond ({cite.10.'Overland_et_al_2008}). Increased oceanic heat transport through the Barents Sea in the first decade of the 21st century and the AMO on longer time scales may also have played a role in determining sea ice anomalies in the Atlantic Arctic ({cite.10.'Dickson_et_al_2000}; {cite.10.'Semenov_2008}; {cite.10.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Day_et_al_2012}) . Based on the evidence in the previous paragraphs there is high confidence that these Arctic amplification mechanisms are currently affecting regional Arctic climate. But it also suggests that the timing of future major sea ice loss events will be difficult to project. There is evidence therefore that internal variability of climate, long-term warming, and Arctic Amplification feedbacks have all contributed to recent decreases in Arctic sea ice ({cite.10.'Kay_et_al_2011b}; {cite.10.'Kinnard_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Overland_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Notz_and_Marotzke_2012}).

Turning to model-based {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies}, {cite.10.'Min_et_al_2008b Min et al. (2008b)} compared the seasonal evolution of Arctic sea ice extent from observations with those simulated by multiple General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}) for 1953–2006. Comparing changes in both the amplitude and shape of the annual cycle of the sea ice extent reduces the chance of spurious detection due to coincidental agreement between the response to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing and other factors, such as slow internal variability. They found that {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} on the sea ice extent changes has been robustly detected since the early 1990s. The anthropogenic signal is also detectable for individual months from May to December, suggesting that human influence, strongest in late summer, now also extends into colder seasons. {cite.10.'Kay_et_al_2011b Kay et al. (2011b)}, {cite.10.'Jahn_et_al_2012 Jahn et al. (2012)} and {cite.10.'Schweiger_et_al_2011 Schweiger et al. (2011)} used the Community {Topics.*Climate_System Climate System} Model 4 (CCSM4) to investigate the influence of anthropogenic forcing on late 20th century and early 21st century Arctic sea ice extent and volume trends. On all time scales examined (2 to 50+ years), the most extreme negative extent trends observed in the late 20th century cannot be explained by modeled internal variability alone. Comparing trends from the CCSM4 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} to observed trends suggests that internal variability could account for approximately half of the observed 1979–2005 September Arctic sea ice extent loss. Attribution of anthropogenic forcing is also shown by comparing September sea ice extent as {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} by seven models from the set of CMIP5 models’ hindcasts to control runs without anthropogenic forcing ({'Figure_10_16 Figure 10.16}a; {cite.10.'Wang_and_Overland_2009}). The mean of sea ice extents in seven models’ ensemble members are below the level of their control runs by about 1995, similar to the result of {cite.10.'Min_et_al_2008b Min et al. (2008b)}.

A question as recently as 6 years ago was whether the recent Arctic warming and sea ice loss was unique in the instrumental record and whether the observed trend would continue ({cite.10.'Serreze_et_al_2007}). Arctic temperature anomalies in the 1930s were apparently as large as those in the 1990s and 2000s. There is still considerable discussion of the ultimate causes of the warm temperature anomalies that occurred in the Arctic in the 1920s and 1930s ({cite.10.'Ahlmann_1948}; {cite.10.'Veryard_1963}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007a}, 2007b). The early 20th century warm period, while reflected in the hemispheric average air temperature record ({cite.10.'Brohan_et_al_2006}), did not appear consistently in the mid-latitudes nor on the Pacific side of the Arctic ({cite.10.'Johannessen_et_al_2004}; {cite.10.'Wood_and_Overland_2010}). {cite.10.'Polyakov_et_al_2003 Polyakov et al. (2003)} argued that the Arctic air temperature records reflected a natural cycle of about 50 to 80 years. However, many authors ({cite.10.'Bengtsson_et_al_2004}; {cite.10.'Grant_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Wood_and_Overland_2010}; Brönnimann et al., 2012) instead link the 1930s temperatures to internal variability in the North Atlantic atmospheric and ocean circulation as a single episode that was sustained by ocean and sea ice processes in the Arctic and north Atlantic. The Arctic-wide increases of temperature in the last decade contrast with the episodic regional increases in the early 20th century, suggesting that it is unlikely that recent increases are due to the same primary climate process as the early 20th century.

In the case of the Arctic we have high confidence in observations since 1979, from models (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3} and from simulations comparing with and without anthropogenic forcing), and from physical understanding of the dominant processes; taking these three factors together it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the observed decreases in Arctic sea ice since 1979.

Whereas sea ice extent in the Arctic has decreased, sea ice extent in the Antarctic has very likely increased ({Chapters.4.4_2.4_2_3 Section 4.2.3}). Sea ice extent across the SH over the year as a whole increased by 1.3 to 1.67% per decade from 1979 to 2012, with the largest increase in the Ross Sea during the autumn, while sea ice extent decreased in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea ({cite.10.'Comiso_and_Nishio_2008}; {cite.10.'Turner_et_al_2009}, 2013; {Chapters.4.4_2.4_2_3 Section 4.2.3}; {cite.10.'Oza_et_al_2011b}). The observed upward trend in Antarctic sea ice extent is found to be inconsistent with internal variability based on the residuals from a linear trend fitted to the observations, though this approach could underestimate multi-decadal variability ({Chapters.4.4_2.4_2_3 Section 4.2.3}; {cite.10.'Turner_et_al_2013}; {Chapters.4.4_2.4_2_3 Section 4.2.3}; {cite.10.'Zunz_et_al_2013}). The CMIP5 simulations on average simulate a decrease in Antarctic sea ice extent ({cite.10.'Turner_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Zunz_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_10_16 Figure 10.16}b), though {cite.10.'Turner_et_al_2013 Turner et al. (2013)} find that approximately 10% of CMIP5 simulations exhibit an increasing trend in Antarctic sea ice extent larger than observed over the 1979–2005 period. However, Antarctic sea ice extent variability appears on average to be too large in the CMIP5 models ({cite.10.'Turner_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Zunz_et_al_2013}). Overall, the shortness of the observed record and differences in simulated and observed variability preclude an assessment of whether or not the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is inconsistent with internal variability. Based on {'Figure_10_16 Figure 10.16}b and {cite.10.'Meehl_et_al_2007b Meehl et al. (2007b)}, the trend of Antarctic sea ice loss in simulations due to changes in forcing is weak (relative to the Arctic) and the internal variability is high, and thus the time necessary for detection is longer than in the Arctic.

Several recent studies have investigated the possible causes of Antarctic sea ice trends. Early studies suggested that stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} depletion may have driven increasing trends in Antarctic ice extent ({cite.10.'Goosse_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Turner_et_al_2009}; WMO (World Meteorological Organization), 2011), but recent studies demonstrate that simulated sea ice extent decreases in response to prescribed changes in stratospheric ozone ({cite.10.'Sigmond_and_Fyfe_2010}; {cite.10.'Bitz_and_Polvani_2012}). An alternative explanation for the lack of melting of Antarctic sea ice is that sub-surface ocean warming, and enhanced freshwater input possibly in part from {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} melting, have made the high-latitude Southern Ocean fresher (see {Chapters.3.3_3 Section 3.3}) and more stratified, decreasing the upward heat flux and driving more sea ice formation ({cite.10.'Zhang_2007}; {cite.10.'Goosse_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Bintanja_et_al_2013}). An idealized simulation of the response to freshwater input similar to that estimate due to ice shelf melting exhibited an increase in sea ice extent ({cite.10.'Bintanja_et_al_2013}), but this result has yet to be reproduced with other models. Overall we conclude that there is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent since 1979, owing to the larger differences between sea ice simulations from CMIP5 models and to the incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change and low confidence in estimates of internal variability ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3}).
