title: 10.5.3 - Snow Cover

Both satellite and in situ observations show significant reductions in the NH {Glossary.*Snow_cover_extent snow cover extent} (SCE) over the past 90 years, with most reduction occurring in the 1980s (see {Chapters.4.4_5 Section 4.5}). Formal {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} have indicated {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} influence on NH SCE ({cite.10.'Rupp_et_al_2013}) and western USA snow water equivalent ({Glossary.*Snow_water_equivalent SWE}, {cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2008}). {cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2008 Pierce et al. (2008)} detected anthropogenic influence in the ratio of 1 April SWE over October to March precipitation over the period 1950–1999. These reductions could not be explained by natural internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} alone, nor by changes in solar and volcanic forcing. In their analysis of NH SCE using 13 CMIP5 simulations over the 1922–2005 period, {cite.10.'Rupp_et_al_2013 Rupp et al. (2013)} showed that some CMIP5 simulations with natural external and anthropogenic forcings could explain the observed decrease in spring SEC though the CMIP5 simulations with all forcing as a whole could only explain half of the magnitude of decrease, and that volcanic and solar variations (from four CMIP5 simulations) were inconsistent with observations. We conclude with high confidence in the observational and modelling evidence that the decrease in NH snow extent since the 1970s is likely to be caused by all {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} and has an anthropogenic contribution (see {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}).
