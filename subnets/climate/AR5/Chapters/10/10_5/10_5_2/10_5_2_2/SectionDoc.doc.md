title: 10.5.2.2 - Glaciers

In the 20th century, there is robust evidence that large-scale internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} governs interannual to decadal variability in {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} mass ({cite.10.'Hodge_et_al_1998}; {cite.10.'Nesje_et_al_2000}; {cite.10.'Vuille_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Huss_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Marzeion_and_Nesje_2012}) and, along with glacier dynamics, impacts glacier length as well ({cite.10.'Chinn_et_al_2005}). On time periods longer than years and decades, there is now evidence of recent ice loss (see {Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3 Section 4.3.3}) due to increased ambient temperatures and associated regional moisture changes. However, few studies evaluate the direct {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of the current observed mass loss to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing}, owing to the difficulty associated with contrasting scales between glaciers and the large-scale atmospheric circulation (Mölg et al., 2012). {cite.10.'Reichert_et_al_2002 Reichert et al. (2002)} show for two sample sites at mid and high latitude that internal climate variability over multiple millennia as represented in a {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} would not result in such short glacier lengths as observed in the 20th century. For a sample site at low latitude using multi-step {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution attribution}, Mölg et al. (2009) (and references therein) found a close relation between glacier mass loss and the externally forced {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean circulation in the Indian Ocean since the late 19th century. A second, larger group of studies makes use of century-scale glacier records (mostly glacier length but mass balance as well) to extract evidence for external drivers. These include local and regional changes in precipitation and air temperature, and related parameters (such as melt factors and solid/liquid precipitation ratio) estimated from the observed change in glaciers. In general these studies show that the glacier changes reveal unique departures since the 1970s, and that the inferred climatic drivers in the 20th century and particularly in most recent decades, exceed the variability of the earlier parts of the records ({cite.10.'Oerlemans_2005}; {cite.10.'Yamaguchi_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Huss_and_Bauder_2009}; {cite.10.'Huss_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Leclercq_and_Oerlemans_2011}). These results underline the contrast to former centuries where observed glacier fluctuations can be explained by internal climate variability ({cite.10.'Reichert_et_al_2002}; Roe and O’Neal, 2009; Nussbaumer and Zumbühl, 2012). {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} land cover change is an unresolved forcing, but a first assessment suggests that it does not confound the impacts of recent temperature and precipitation changes if the land cover changes are of local nature (Mölg et al., 2012). The robustness of the estimates of observed mass loss since the 1960s ({Chapters.4.4_3 Section 4.3}, {'Figure_4_11 Figure 4.11}), the confidence we have in estimates of natural variations and internal variability from long-term glacier records, and our understanding of glacier response to climatic drivers provides robust evidence and, therefore, high confidence that a substantial part of the mass loss of glaciers is likely due to {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence}.
