title: 10.5.2.1 - Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets

The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are important to regional and global climate because (along with other cryospheric elements) they cause a polar amplification of {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures}, a {Glossary.*Source source} of fresh water to the ocean, and represent a source of potentially irreversible change to the state of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} ({cite.10.'Hansen_and_Lebedeff_1987}). These two ice sheets are important contributors to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise representing two-thirds of the contributions from all ice covered regions ({cite.10.'Jacob_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}; see Sections {Chapters.4.4_4 4.4} and {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_3 13.3.3}). Observations of surface mass balance (increased ablation versus increased snowfall) are dealt with in {Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_3 Section 4.4.3} and {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} models are discussed in Sections {Chapters.13.13_3 13.3} and {Chapters.13.13_5 13.5}.

Attribution of change is difficult as ice sheet and glacier changes are local and ice sheet processes are not generally well represented in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} thus precluding formal single-step {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies}. However, Greenland observational records show large recent changes. {Chapters.13.13_3 Section 13.3} concludes that regional models for Greenland can reproduce trends in the surface mass balance loss quite well if they are forced with the observed meteorological record, but not with forcings from a Global Climate Model. Regional model simulations ({cite.10.'Fettweis_et_al_2013}) show that Greenland surface melt increases nonlinearly with rising temperatures due to the positive {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} between surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and melt.

There have been exceptional changes in Greenland since 2007 marked by record-setting high air temperatures, ice loss by melting and marine-terminating glacier area loss ({cite.10.'Hanna_et_al_2013}; {Chapters.4.4_4 Section 4.4}. 4). Along Greenland’s west coast temperatures in 2010 and 2011 were the warmest since record keeping began in 1873 resulting in the highest observed melt rates in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} since 1958 ({cite.10.'Fettweis_et_al_2011}). The annual rate of area loss in marine-terminating glaciers was 3.4 times that of the previous 8 years, when regular observations became available. In 2012, a new record for summertime ice mass loss was two standard deviations below the 2003–2012 mean, as estimated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite ({cite.10.'Tedesco_et_al_2012}). The {Glossary.*Trend trend} of summer mass change during 2003–2012 is rather uniform over this period at –29 ± 11 Gt yr−1.

Record surface melts during 2007–2012 summers are linked to persistent atmospheric circulation that favored warm air {Glossary.*Advection advection} over Greenland. These persistent events have changed in frequency since the beginning of the 2000s (L’Heureux et al., 2010; {cite.10.'Fettweis_et_al_2011}). {cite.10.'Hanna_et_al_2013 Hanna et al. (2013)} show a weak relation of Greenland temperatures and ice sheet {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} with the {Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}; they more strongly correlate with a Greenland atmospheric {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} index. {cite.10.'Overland_et_al_2012 Overland et al. (2012)} and {cite.10.'Francis_and_Vavrus_2012 Francis and Vavrus (2012)} suggest that the increased frequency of the Greenland blocking pattern is related to broader scale Arctic changes. Since 2007, {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} is likely to have further enhanced the melt over Greenland. Mass loss and melt is also occurring in Greenland through the intrusion of warm water into the major glaciers such as Jacobshaven {Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} ({cite.10.'Holland_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Walker_et_al_2009}).

{cite.10.'Hanna_et_al_2008 Hanna et al. (2008)} attribute increased Greenland runoff and melt since 1990 to global warming; southern Greenland coastal and NH summer temperatures were uncorrelated between the 1960s and early 1990s but correlated significantly positively thereafter. This relationship was modulated by the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, whose summer index significantly negatively correlated with southern Greenland summer temperatures until the early 1990s but not thereafter. Regional modelling and observations tell a consistent story of the response of Greenland temperatures and ice sheet runoff to shifts in recent regional atmospheric circulation associated with larger scale flow patterns and global temperature increases. It is likely that {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} has contributed to surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993.

There is clear evidence that the West Antarctic ice sheet is contributing to sea level rise ({cite.10.'Bromwich_et_al_2013}). Estimates of ice mass in Antarctic since 2000 show that the greatest losses are at the edges (see {Chapters.4.4_4 Section 4.4}). An analysis of observations underneath a floating {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} off West Antarctica shows that ocean warming and more transport of heat by ocean circulation are largely responsible for increasing melt rates ({cite.10.'Jacobs_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Joughin_and_Alley_2011}; {cite.10.'Mankoff_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}).

Antarctica has regionally dependent decadal variability in {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} with variations in these trends depending on the strength of the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} {Glossary.*Climate_pattern climate pattern}. Recent warming in continental west Antarctica has been linked to {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} changes in the tropical Pacific ({cite.10.'Ding_et_al_2011}). As with Antarctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, changes in Antarctic ice sheets have complex causes ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_3 Section 4.4.3}). The observational record of Antarctic mass loss is short and the internal variability of the ice sheet is poorly understood. Due to a low level of scientific understanding there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet since 1993. Possible future instabilities in the west Antarctic ice sheet cannot be ruled out, but {Topics.*Climate_Projections projection} of future climate changes over West Antarctica remains subject to considerable {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} ({cite.10.'Steig_and_Orsi_2013}).
