title: 10.4.4 - Oxygen and Ocean Acidity

Oxygen is an important physical and biological tracer in the ocean ({Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_3 Section 3.8.3}) and is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} to decline by 3 to 6% by 2100 in response to surface warming (see {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_5 Section 6.4.5}). Oxygen decreases are also observed in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and linked to burning of fossil fuels ({Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_3.6_1_3_2 Section 6.1.3.2}). Despite the relatively few observational studies of oxygen change in the oceans ({cite.10.'Bindoff_and_McDougall_2000}; {cite.10.'Ono_et_al_2001}; {cite.10.'Keeling_and_Garcia_2002}; {cite.10.'Emerson_et_al_2004}; {cite.10.'Aoki_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Mecking_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Nakanowatari_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Brandt_et_al_2010}) they all show a pattern of change consistent with the known ocean circulation and surface {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation}. A recent global analysis of oxygen data from the 1960s to 1990s for change confirm these earlier results and extends the spatial coverage from local to global scales ({cite.10.'Helm_et_al_2011}). The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. The {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution attribution} study of oxygen decreases using two {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs}) concluded that observed changes for the Atlantic Ocean are ‘indistinguishable from natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}’; however, the changes of the global zonal mean to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} (all forcings including {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}) has a detectable influence at the 10% significance level ({cite.10.'Andrews_et_al_2013}). The chief sources of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} are the paucity of oxygen observations, particularly in time, the precise role of the {Glossary.*Biological_pump biological pump} and changes in ocean productivity in the models (see Sections {Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_3 3.8.3} and {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_5 6.4.5}), and model circulation biases particularly near the oxygen minimum zone in tropical waters ({cite.10.'Brandt_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Keeling_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Stramma_et_al_2010}). These results of observed changes in oxygen and the attribution studies of oxygen changes ({cite.10.'Andrews_et_al_2013}), along with the attribution of human influences on the physical factors that affect oxygen in the oceans such as {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} changes ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2 Section 10.3.2}), increased ocean heat content ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_1 Section 10.4.1}) and observed increased in ocean stratification ({Chapters.3.3_2.3_2_2 Section 3.2.2}) provides evidence for {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} on oxygen. When these lines of evidence are taken together it is concluded that with medium confidence or about as likely as not that the observed oxygen decreases can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} in part to human influences.

The observed trends (since the 1980s) for {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} and its cause from rising {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations is discussed in {Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_2 Section 3.8.2} ({Box_3_2 Box 3.2} and {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). There is very high confidence that {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 has resulted in the acidification of surface waters of between –0.0015 and –0.0024 {Glossary.*pH pH} units per year.
