title: 10.4.3 - Sea Level

At the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the historical {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise budget had not been closed (within {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}), and there were few studies quantifying the contribution of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} to the observed sea level rise and {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} melting. Relying on expert assessment, the AR4 had concluded based on modelling and ocean heat content studies that ocean warming and glacier mass loss had very likely contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century. The AR4 had reported that {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} that included {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural forcings simulated the observed {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} since 1961 reasonably well, and that it is very unlikely that the warming during the past half century is due only to known natural causes ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}).

Since the AR4, corrections applied to instrumental errors in ocean temperature measurements have considerably improved estimates of upper-ocean heat content (see Sections {Chapters.3.3_2 3.2} and {Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_1 10.4.1}), and therefore ocean thermal expansion. Closure of the global {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level} rise budget as an evolving time series since the early 1970s ({cite.10.'Church_et_al_2011}) indicates that the two major contributions to the rate of global mean sea level rise have been thermal expansion and glacier melting with additional contributions from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Observations since 1971 indicate with high confidence that thermal expansion and glaciers (excluding the glaciers in Antarctica) explain 75% of the observed rise (see {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_6 Section 13.3.6}). {Glossary.*Ice_sheet Ice sheet} contributions remain the greatest {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty over this period and on longer time scales. Over the 20th century, the global mean sea level rise budget (Gregory et al., 2012 ) has been another important step in understanding the relative contributions of different drivers.

The observed contribution from thermal expansion is well captured in climate model simulations with historical forcings as are contributions from glacier melt when simulated by glacier models driven by climate model simulations of historical climate ({cite.10.'Church_et_al_2013}; {'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}). The model results indicate that most of the variation in the contributions of thermal expansion and glacier melt to global mean sea level is in response to natural and anthropogenic RFs ({cite.10.'Domingues_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Palmer_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Church_et_al_2013}).

The strong physical relationship between {Glossary.*Thermosteric thermosteric} sea level and ocean heat content (through the equation of state for seawater) means that the anthropogenic ocean warming ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_1 Section 10.4.1}) has contributed to global sea level rise over this period through thermal expansion. As {Chapters.10.10_5.10_5_2 Section 10.5.2} concludes, it is likely that the observed substantial mass loss of glaciers is due to {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} and that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing and internal variability are both contributors to recent observed changes on the Greenland ice sheet. The causes of recently observed Antarctic ice sheet contribution to sea level are less clear due to the short observational record and incomplete understanding of natural variability. Taking the causes of Greenland ice sheet melt and glacier mass loss together (see {Chapters.10.10_5.10_5_2 Section 10.5.2}), it is concluded with high confidence that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to sea level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets. Combining the evidence from ocean warming and mass loss of glaciers we conclude that it is very likely that there is a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcing to the global mean sea level rise since the 1970s.

On ocean basin scales, detection and attribution studies do show the emergence of detectable signals in the thermosteric component of sea level that can be largely {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to human influence ({cite.10.'Barnett_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2012}). Regional changes in sea level at the subocean basin scales and finer exhibit more complex variations associated with natural (dynamical) modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({Chapters.13.13_6 Section 13.6}). In some regions, sea level trends have been observed to differ significantly from global mean trends. These have been related to thermosteric changes in some areas and in others to changing wind fields and resulting changes in the ocean circulation ({cite.10.'Han_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Timmermann_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Merrifield_and_Maltrud_2011}). The regional variability on decadal and longer time scales can be quite large (and is not well quantified in currently available observations) compared to secular changes in the winds that influence sea level. {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} of human influences on sea level at the regional scale (that is smaller than sub-ocean basin scales) is currently limited by the relatively small anthropogenic contributions compared to natural variability ({cite.10.'Meyssignac_et_al_2012}) and the need for more sophisticated approaches than currently available.
