title: 10.4.2 - Ocean Salinity and Freshwater Fluxes

There is increasing recognition of the importance of ocean salinity as an essential climate variable ({cite.10.'Doherty_et_al_2009}), particularly for understanding the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle}. In the IPCC {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 Fourth Assessment Report} observed ocean salinity change indicated that there was a systematic pattern of increased salinity in the shallow subtropics and a tendency to freshening of waters that originate in the polar regions ({cite.10.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}) ({'Figure_10_15 Figure 10.15}a, upper and lower panels). New atlases and revisions of the earlier work based on the increasing number of the Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) profile data, and historical data have extended the observational salinity data sets allowing the examination of the longterm changes at the surface and in the interior of the ocean ({Chapters.3.3_3 Section 3.3}) and supporting analyses of precipitation changes over land (see Sections {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2.10_3_2_2 10.3.2.2} and {Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_1 2.5.1}).

Patterns of subsurface salinity changes largely follow the existing mean salinity pattern at the surface and within the ocean. For example, the inter-basin contrast between the Atlantic (salty) and Pacific Oceans (fresh) has intensified over the observed record ({cite.10.'Boyer_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Hosoda_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Roemmich_and_Gilson_2009}; von Schuckmann et al., 2009; {cite.10.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}). In the Southern Ocean, many studies show a coherent freshening of Antarctic Intermediate Water that is subducted at about 50°S ({cite.10.'Johnson_and_Orsi_1997}; {cite.10.'Wong_et_al_1999}; {cite.10.'Bindoff_and_McDougall_2000}; {cite.10.'Curry_et_al_2003}; {cite.10.'Boyer_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Roemmich_and_Gilson_2009}; {cite.10.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.10.'Helm_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Kobayashi_et_al_2012}). There is also a clear increase in salinity of the high-salinity subtropical waters ({cite.10.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.10.'Helm_et_al_2010}).

The 50-year trends in surface salinity show that there is a strong positive correlation between the mean climate of the surface salinity and its temporal changes from 1950 to 2000 (see Figures {'Figure_3_4 3.4} and {'Figure_10_15 10.15}b ‘ocean obs’ point). The correlation between the climate and the trends in surface salinity of 0.7 implies that fresh surface waters get fresher, and salty waters get saltier ({cite.10.'Durack_et_al_2012}). Such patterns of surface salinity change are also found in {Topics.*Climate_System Atmosphere}–Ocean General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM}) simulations both for the 20th century and projected future changes into the 21st century ({'Figure_10_15 Figure 10.15}b). The pattern of temporal change in observations from CMIP3 simulations is particularly strong for those {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} using Special Report on {Topics.*Emissions Emission} {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} (SRES) with larger global warming changes ({'Figure_10_15 Figure 10.15}b). For the period 1950–2000 the observed amplification of the surface salinity is 16 ± 10% per °C of warming and is twice the simulated surface salinity change in CMIP3 models. This difference between the surface salinity amplification is plausibly caused by the tendency of CMIP3 ocean models mixing surface salinity into deeper layers and consequently surface salinity increases at a slower rate than observed ({cite.10.'Durack_et_al_2012}).

Although there are now many established observed long-term trends of salinity change at the ocean surface and within the interior ocean at regional and global scales ({Chapters.3.3_3 Section 3.3}), there are relatively few studies that attribute these changes formally to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing. Analysis at the regional scale of the observed recent surface salinity increases in the North Atlantic (20°N to 50°N) show a small signal that could be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} but for this ocean is not significant compared with internal variability ({cite.10.'Stott_et_al_2008a}; {cite.10.'Terray_et_al_2012}; and {'Figure_10_15 Figure 10.15}c). On a larger spatial scale, the surface salinity patterns in the band from 30°S to 50°N show anthropogenic contributions that are larger than the 5 to 95% {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range ({cite.10.'Terray_et_al_2012}). The strongest signals that can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing are in the tropics (TRO, 30°S to 30°N) and the western Pacific. These results also show the salinity contrast between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is also enhanced with significant contributions from anthropogenic forcing.

On a global scale surface and subsurface salinity changes (1955–2004) over the upper 250 m of the water column cannot be explained by natural variability (probability is <0.05) ({cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2012}). However, the observed salinity changes match the model distribution of forced changes (GHG and tropospheric aerosols), with the observations typically falling between the 25th and 75th percentile of the model distribution at all depth levels for salinity (and temperature). Natural external variability taken from the simulations with just solar and volcanic variations in forcing do not match the observations at all, thus excluding the hypothesis that observed trends can be explained by just solar or volcanic variations.

The results from surface salinity trends and changes are consistent with the results from studies of precipitation over the tropical ocean from the shorter satellite record ({cite.10.'Wentz_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Allan_et_al_2010}). These surface salinity results are also consistent with our understanding of the thermodynamic response of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} to warming ({cite.10.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.10.'Stephens_and_Hu_2010}) and the amplification of the {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle}. The large number of studies showing patterns of change consistent with amplification of the water cycle, and the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and attribution studies for the tropical oceans ({cite.10.'Terray_et_al_2012}) and the global pattern of ocean salinity change ({cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2012}), when combined with our understanding of the physics of the water cycle and estimates of internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, give high confidence in our understanding of the drivers of surface and near surface salinity changes. It is very likely that these salinity changes have a discernable contribution from anthropogenic forcing since the 1960s.
