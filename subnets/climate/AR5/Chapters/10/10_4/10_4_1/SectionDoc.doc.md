title: 10.4.1 - Ocean Temperature and Heat Content

The oceans are a key part of the Earth’s {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} (Boxes {Box_3_1 3.1} and {Box_13_1 13.1}). Observational studies continue to demonstrate that the ocean heat content has increased in the upper layers of the ocean during the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century ({Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}; {cite.10.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}), and that this increase is consistent with a net positive radiative imbalance in the climate system. It is of significance that this heat content increase is an order of magnitude larger than the increase in energy content of any other component of the Earth’s ocean–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–{Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere} system and accounts for more than 90% of the Earth’s energy increase between 1971 and 2010 (e.g., Boxes {Box_3_1 3.1} and {Box_13_1 13.1}; {cite.10.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Church_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Hansen_et_al_2011}).

Despite the evidence for {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} warming of the ocean, the level of confidence in the conclusions of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} report—that the warming of the upper several hundred meters of the ocean during the second half of the 20th century was likely to be due to anthropogenic forcing—reflected the level of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} at that time. The major uncertainty was an apparently large decadal variability (warming in the 1970s and cooling in the early 1980s) in the observational estimates that was not simulated by {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}, see their {'Table_9_4 Table 9.4}). The large decadal variability in observations raised concerns about the capacity of climate models to simulate observed variability. There were also lingering concerns about the presence of non-climate–related biases in the observations of ocean heat content change ({cite.10.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.10.'AchutaRao_et_al_2006}). After the IPCC AR4 report in 2007, time-and depth-dependent systematic errors in bathythermograph temperatures were discovered ({cite.10.'Gouretski_and_Koltermann_2007}; {Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}). Bathythermograph data account for a large fraction of the historical temperature observations and are therefore a {Glossary.*Source source} of bias in ocean heat content studies. Bias corrections were then developed and applied to observations. With the newer bias-corrected estimates ({cite.10.'Domingues_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Wijffels_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Ishii_and_Kimoto_2009}; {cite.10.'Levitus_et_al_2009}), it became obvious that the large decadal variability in earlier estimates of global upper-ocean heat content was an observational artefact ({Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}).

The interannual to decadal variability of ocean temperature simulated by the CMIP3 models agrees better with observations when the model data is sampled using the observational data mask ({cite.10.'AchutaRao_et_al_2007}). In the upper 700 m, CMIP3 model simulations agreed more closely with observational estimates of global ocean heat content based on bias-corrected ocean temperature data, both in terms of the decadal variability and multi-decadal {Glossary.*Trend trend} ({'Figure_10_14 Figure 10.14}a) when forced with the most complete set of natural and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} ({cite.10.'Domingues_et_al_2008}). For the simulations with the most complete set of forcings, the multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean trend was only 10% smaller than observed for 1961–1999. Model simulations that included only anthropogenic forcing (i.e., no solar or volcanic forcing) significantly overestimate the multi-decadal trend and underestimate decadal variability. This overestimate of the trend is partially caused by the ocean’s response to volcanic eruptions, which results in rapid cooling followed by decadal or longer time variations during the recovery phase. Although it has been suggested ({cite.10.'Gregory_2010}) that the cooling trend from successive volcanic events is an artefact because models were not spun up with volcanic forcing, this discrepancy is not expected to be as significant in the upper ocean as in the deeper layers where longer term adjustments take place (Gregory et al., 2012 ). Thus for the upper ocean, there is high confidence that the more frequent eruptions during the second half of the 20th century have caused a multi-decadal cooling that partially offsets the anthropogenic warming and contributes to the apparent decadal variability ({cite.10.'Church_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Delworth_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Fyfe_2006}; {cite.10.'Gleckler_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Gregory_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'AchutaRao_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Domingues_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Palmer_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Stenchikov_et_al_2009}).

{cite.10.'Gleckler_et_al_2012 Gleckler et al. (2012)} examined the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and attribution of upperocean warming in the context of uncertainties in the underlying observational data sets, models and methods. Using three bias-corrected observational estimates of upper-ocean temperature changes ({cite.10.'Domingues_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Ishii_and_Kimoto_2009}; {cite.10.'Levitus_et_al_2009}) and models from the CMIP3 multi-model archive, they found that multi-decadal trends in the observations were best understood by including contributions from both natural and anthropogenic forcings. The anthropogenic {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} in observed upper-ocean warming, driven by global mean and basin-scale pattern changes, was also detected. The strength of this signal (estimated from successively longer trend periods of ocean heat content starting from 1970) crossed the 5% and 1% significance threshold in 1980 and progressively becomes more strongly detected for longer trend periods ({'Figure_10_14 Figure 10.14}b), for all ocean heat content time series. This stronger detection for longer periods occurs because the noise (standard deviation of trends in the unforced changes in pattern similarity from model control runs) tends to decrease for longer trend lengths. On decadal time scales, there is limited evidence that basin scale space-time variability structure of CMIP3 models is approximately 25% lower than the (poorly constrained) observations, this underestimate is far less than the factor of 2 needed to throw the anthropogenic fingerprint into question. This result is robust to a number of known observational, model, methodological and structural uncertainties.

An analysis of upper-ocean (0 to 700 m) temperature changes for 1955–2004, using bias-corrected observations and 20 global climate models from CMIP5 ({cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2012}) builds on previous detection and attribution studies of ocean temperature ({cite.10.'Barnett_et_al_2001}, 2005; {cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2006}). This analysis found that observed temperature changes during the above period are inconsistent with the effects of natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. That is signal strengths are separated from zero at the 5% significance level, and the probability that the null hypothesis of observed changes being consistent with natural variability is less than 0.05 from variability either internal to the climate system alone, or externally forced by solar fluctuations and volcanic eruptions. However, the observed ocean changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenically induced atmospheric changes from {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} concentrations.

Attribution to anthropogenic warming from recent detection and attribution studies ({cite.10.'Gleckler_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2012}) have made use of new bias-corrected observations and have systematically explored methodological uncertainties, yielding more confidence in the results. With greater consistency and agreement across observational data sets and {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of structural issues, the major uncertainties at the time of AR4 have now largely been resolved. The high levels of confidence and the increased understanding of the contributions from both natural and anthropogenic sources across the many studies mean that it is very likely that the increase in global ocean heat content observed in the upper 700 m since the 1970s has a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcing.

Although there is high confidence in understanding the causes of global heat content increases, attribution of regional heat content changes are less certain. Earlier regional studies used a fixed depth data and only considered basin-scale averages ({cite.10.'Barnett_et_al_2005}). At regional scales, however, changes in {Glossary.*Advection advection} of ocean heat are important and need to be isolated from changes due to air–sea heat fluxes ({cite.10.'Palmer_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Grist_et_al_2010}). Their fixed isotherm (rather than fixed depth) approach to optimal detection analysis, in addition to being largely insensitive to observational biases, is designed to separate the ocean’s response to air–sea flux changes from advective changes. Air– sea fluxes are the primary mechanism by which the oceans are expected to respond to externally forced anthropogenic and natural volcanic influences. The finer temporal resolution of the analysis allowed {cite.10.'Palmer_et_al_2009 Palmer et al. (2009)} to attribute distinct short-lived cooling episodes to major volcanic eruptions while, at multi-decadal time scales, a more spatially uniform near-surface (~ upper 200 m) warming pattern was detected across all ocean basins (except in high latitudes where the isotherm approach has limitations due to outcropping of isotherms at the ocean surface) and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to anthropogenic causes at the 5% significance level. Considering that individual ocean basins are affected by different observational and modelling uncertainties and that internal variability is larger at smaller scales, detection of significant anthropogenic forcing through space and time studies ({cite.10.'Palmer_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Pierce_et_al_2012}) provides more compelling evidence of {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} at regional scales of near-surface ocean warming observed during the second half of the 20th century.
