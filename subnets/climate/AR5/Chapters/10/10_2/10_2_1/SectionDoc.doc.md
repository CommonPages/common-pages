title: 10.2.1 - The Context of Detection and Attribution

In IPCC Assessments, detection and attribution involve quantifying the evidence for a causal link between external drivers of climate change and observed changes in climatic variables. It provides the central, although not the only (see {Chapters.1.1_2.1_2_3 Section 1.2.3}) line of evidence that has supported statements such as ‘the balance of evidence suggests a discernible {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} on global climate’ or ‘most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} greenhouse gas concentrations.’

The definition of detection and attribution used here follows the terminology in the IPCC guidance paper ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2010}). ‘{Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} of change is defined as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense without providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected in observations if its {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of occurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined to be small’ ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2010}). Attribution is defined as ‘the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence’. As this wording implies, attribution is more complex than detection, combining statistical analysis with physical understanding ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011}). In general, a component of an observed change is {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to a specific causal factor if the observations can be shown to be consistent with results from a process-based model that includes the causal factor in question, and inconsistent with an alternate, otherwise identical, model that excludes this factor. The evaluation of this consistency in both of these cases takes into account internal {Glossary.*Chaotic chaotic} variability and known {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the observations and responses to external causal factors.

Attribution does not require, and nor does it imply, that every aspect of the response to the causal factor in question is simulated correctly. Suppose, for example, the global cooling following a large volcano matches the cooling simulated by a model, but the model underestimates the magnitude of this cooling: the observed global cooling can still be attributed to that volcano, although the error in magnitude would suggest that details of the model response may be unreliable. Physical understanding is required to assess what constitutes a plausible discrepancy above that expected from internal variability. Even with complete consistency between models and data, attribution statements can never be made with 100% certainty because of the presence of internal variability.

This definition of attribution can be extended to include antecedent conditions and internal variability among the multiple causal factors contributing to an observed change or event. Understanding the relative importance of internal versus external factors is important in the analysis of individual weather events ({Chapters.10.10_6.10_6_2 Section 10.6.2}), but the primary focus of this chapter will be on attribution to factors external to the climate system, like rising GHG levels, solar variability and volcanic activity.

There are four core elements to any detection and attribution study:

  1. Observations of one or more climate variables, such as {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature}, that are understood, on physical grounds, to be relevant to the process in question
  2. An estimate of how external drivers of climate change have evolved before and during the period under investigation, including both the driver whose influence is being investigated (such as rising GHG levels) and potential confounding influences (such as {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity})
  3. A quantitative physically based understanding, normally encapsulated in a model, of how these external drivers are thought to have affected these observed climate variables
  4. An estimate, often but not always derived from a physically based model, of the characteristics of variability expected in these observed climate variables due to random, quasi-periodic and chaotic fluctuations generated in the climate system that are not due to externally driven climate change

A climate model driven with {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} alone is not expected to replicate the observed evolution of internal variability, because of the chaotic nature of the climate system, but it should be able to capture the statistics of this variability (often referred to as ‘noise’). The reliability of forecasts of short-term variability is also a useful test of the representation of relevant processes in the models used for attribution, but forecast skill is not necessary for attribution: attribution focuses on changes in the underlying moments of the ‘weather attractor’, meaning the expected weather and its variability, while {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} focuses on the actual trajectory of the weather around this attractor.

In proposing that ‘the process of attribution requires the detection of a change in the observed variable or closely associated variables’ ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2010}), the new guidance recognized that it may be possible, in some instances, to attribute a change in a particular variable to some external factor before that change could actually be detected in the variable itself, provided there is a strong body of knowledge that links a change in that variable to some other variable in which a change can be detected and attributed. For example, it is impossible in principle to detect a {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the frequency of 1-in-100-year events in a 100-year record, yet if the probability of occurrence of these events is physically related to large-scale temperature changes, and we detect and attribute a large-scale warming, then the new guidance allows attribution of a change in probability of occurrence before such a change can be detected in observations of these events alone. This was introduced to draw on the strength of attribution statements from, for example, time-averaged temperatures, to attribute changes in closely related variables.

Attribution of observed changes is not possible without some kind of model of the relationship between external climate drivers and observable variables. We cannot observe a world in which either anthropogenic or natural forcing is absent, so some kind of model is needed to set up and evaluate quantitative hypotheses: to provide estimates of how we would expect such a world to behave and to respond to anthropogenic and natural forcings ({cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011}). Models may be very simple, just a set of statistical assumptions, or very complex, complete global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}: it is not necessary, or possible, for them to be correct in all respects, but they must provide a physically consistent representation of processes and scales relevant to the attribution problem in question.

One of the simplest approaches to detection and attribution is to compare observations with model simulations driven with natural forcings alone, and with simulations driven with all relevant natural and anthropogenic forcings. If observed changes are consistent with simulations that include human influence, and inconsistent with those that do not, this would be sufficient for attribution providing there were no other confounding influences and it is assumed that models are simulating the responses to all {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} correctly. This is a strong assumption, and most attribution studies avoid relying on it. Instead, they typically assume that models simulate the shape of the response to external forcings (meaning the large-scale pattern in space and/or time) correctly, but do not assume that models simulate the magnitude of the response correctly. This is justified by our fundamental understanding of the origins of errors in climate modelling. Although there is uncertainty in the size of key forcings and the {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}, the overall shape of the response is better known: it is set in time by the timing of {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and set in space (in the case of {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures}) by the geography of the continents and differential responses of land and ocean (see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_2 Section 10.3.1.1.2}).

So-called ‘{Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint}’ detection and attribution studies characterize their results in terms of a best estimate and uncertainty range for ‘scaling factors’ by which the model-simulated responses to individual forcings can be scaled up or scaled down while still remaining consistent with the observations, accounting for similarities between the patterns of response to different forcings and uncertainty due to internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. If a scaling factor is significantly larger than zero (at some significance level), then the response to that forcing, as simulated by that model and given that estimate of internal variability and other potentially confounding responses, is detectable in these observations, whereas if the scaling factor is consistent with unity, then that model-simulated response is consistent with observed changes. Studies do not require scaling factors to be consistent with unity for attribution, but any discrepancy from unity should be understandable in terms of known uncertainties in forcing or response: a scaling factor of 10, for example, might suggest the presence of a confounding factor, calling into question any attribution claim. Scaling factors are estimated by fitting model-simulated responses to observations, so results are unaffected, at least to first order, if the model has a transient climate response, or {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} forcing, that is too low or high. Conversely, if the spatial or temporal pattern of forcing or response is wrong, results can be affected: see {Box_10_1 Box 10.1} and further discussion in {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1 Section 10.3.1.1} and {cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011 Hegerl and Zwiers (2011)} and {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2011b Hegerl et al. (2011b)}. Sensitivity of results to the pattern of forcing or response can be assessed by comparing results across multiple models or by representing pattern uncertainty explicitly ({cite.10.'Huntingford_et_al_2006}), but errors that are common to all models (through limited vertical {Glossary.*Resolution resolution}, for example) will not be addressed in this way and are accounted for in this assessment by downgrading overall assessed likelihoods to be generally more conservative than the quantitative likelihoods provided by individual studies.

Attribution studies must compromise between estimating responses to different forcings separately, which allows for the possibility of different errors affecting different responses (errors in aerosol forcing that do not affect the response to {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, for example), and estimating responses to combined forcings, which typically gives smaller uncertainties because it avoids the issue of ‘degeneracy’: if two responses have very similar shapes in space and time, then it may be impossible to estimate the magnitude of both from a single set of observations because amplification of one may be almost exactly compensated for by amplification or diminution of the other ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2006}). Many studies find it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the responses to GHG and other anthropogenic forcings separately, particularly when spatial information is included. This is important, because it means the estimated response to GHG increase is not dependent on the uncertain magnitude of forcing and response due to aerosols ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2011b}).

The simplest way of fitting model-simulated responses to observations is to assume that the responses to different forcings add linearly, so the response to any one forcing can be scaled up or down without affecting any of the others and that internal climate variability is independent of the response to external forcing. Under these conditions, attribution can be expressed as a variant of linear regression (see {Box_10_1 Box 10.1}). The additivity assumption has been tested and found to hold for large-scale temperature changes ({cite.10.'Meehl_et_al_2003}; {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2004}) but it might not hold for other variables like precipitation ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011}; {cite.10.'Shiogama_et_al_2012}), nor for regional temperature changes ({cite.10.'Terray_2012}). In principle, additivity is not required for detection and attribution, but to date non-additive approaches have not been widely adopted.

The estimated properties of internal climate variability play a central role in this assessment. These are either estimated empirically from the observations ({Chapters.10.10_2.10_2_2 Section 10.2.2}) or from {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} reconstructions ({Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_1 Section 10.7.1}) ({cite.10.'Esper_et_al_2012}) or derived from control simulations of coupled models ({Chapters.10.10_2.10_2_3 Section 10.2.3}). The majority of studies use modelled variability and routinely check that the residual variability from observations is consistent with modelled internal variability used over time scales shorter than the length of the instrumental record ({cite.10.'Allen_and_Tett_1999}). Assessing the accuracy of model-simulated variability on longer time scales using paleoclimate reconstructions is complicated by the fact that some reconstructions may not capture the full spectrum of variability because of limitations of proxies and {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} methods, and by the unknown role of external forcing in the pre-instrumental record. In general, however, paleoclimate reconstructions provide no clear evidence either way whether models are over or underestimating internal variability on time scales relevant for attribution ({cite.10.'Esper_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Schurer_et_al_2013}).
