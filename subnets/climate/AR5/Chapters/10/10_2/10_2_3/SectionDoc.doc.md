title: 10.2.3 - Methods Based on General Circulation Models and Optimal Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting methods use climate model simulations to provide more complete information about the expected response to different external drivers, including spatial information, and the properties of internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. This can help to separate patterns of forced change both from each other and from internal variability. The price, however, is that results depend to some degree on the accuracy of the shape of model-simulated responses to external factors (e.g., {cite.10.'North_and_Stevens_1998}), which is assessed by comparing results obtained with expected responses estimated from different {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. When the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is low, as can be the case for some regional indicators and some variables other than temperature, the accuracy of the specification of variability becomes a central factor in the reliability of any {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} study. Many studies of such variables inflate the variability estimate from models to determine if results are sensitive to, for example, doubling of variance in the control (e.g., {cite.10.'Zhang_et_al_2007}), although {cite.10.'Imbers_et_al_2013 Imbers et al. (2013)} note that errors in the spectral properties of simulated variability may also be important.

A full description of optimal fingerprinting is provided in {Appendix_9_A Appendix 9.A} of {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b Hegerl et al. (2007b)} and further discussion is to be found in {cite.10.'Hasselmann_1997 Hasselmann (1997)}, {cite.10.'Allen_and_Tett_1999 Allen and Tett (1999)}, {cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2006 Allen et al. (2006)}, and {cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011 Hegerl and Zwiers (2011)}. {Box_10_1 Box 10.1} provides a simple example of ‘fingerprinting’ based on {Topics.*Surface_Temperature GMST} alone. In a typical {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} analysis, model-simulated spatio-temporal patterns of response to different combinations of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}, including segments of control integrations with no forcing, are ‘observed’ in a similar manner to the historical record (masking out times and regions where observations are absent). The magnitudes of the model-simulated responses are then estimated in the observations using a variant of linear regression, possibly allowing for signals being contaminated by internal variability ({cite.10.'Allen_and_Stott_2003}) and structural model uncertainty ({cite.10.'Huntingford_et_al_2006}).

In ‘optimal’ fingerprinting, model-simulated responses and observations are normalized by internal variability to improve the S/N ratio. This requires an estimate of the inverse noise covariance estimated from the sample covariance matrix of a set of unforced (control) simulations ({cite.10.'Hasselmann_1997}), or from variations within an initial-condition {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}. Because these control runs are generally too short to estimate the full covariance matrix, a truncated version is used, retaining only a small number, typically of order 10 to 20, of high-variance principal components. Sensitivity analyses are essential to ensure results are robust to this, relatively arbitrary, choice of truncation ({cite.10.'Allen_and_Tett_1999}; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}; Jones et al., 2013 ). {cite.10.'Ribes_et_al_2009 Ribes et al. (2009)} use a regularized estimate of the covariance matrix, meaning a linear combination of the sample covariance matrix and a unit matrix that has been shown ({cite.10.'Ledoit_and_Wolf_2004}) to provide a more accurate estimate of the true covariance, thereby avoiding dependence on truncation. Optimization of S/N ratio is not, however, essential for many attribution results (see, e.g., {Box_10_1 Box 10.1}) and uncertainty analysis in conventional optimal fingerprinting does not require the covariance matrix to be inverted, so although regularization may help in some cases, it is not essential. {cite.10.'Ribes_et_al_2010 Ribes et al. (2010)} also propose a hybrid of the model-based optimal fingerprinting and time series approaches, referred to as ‘temporal optimal detection’, under which each signal is assumed to consist of a single spatial pattern modulated by a smoothly varying time series estimated from a climate model (see also {cite.10.'Santer_et_al_1994}).

The final statistical step in an attribution study is to check that the residual variability, after the responses to external drivers have been estimated and removed, is consistent with the expected properties of internal climate variability, to ensure that the variability used for uncertainty analysis is realistic, and that there is no evidence that a potentially confounding factor has been omitted. Many studies use a standard F-test of residual consistency for this purpose ({cite.10.'Allen_and_Tett_1999}). {cite.10.'Ribes_et_al_2013 Ribes et al. (2013)} raise some issues with this test, but key results are not found to be sensitive to different formulations. A more important issue is that the F-test is relatively weak ({cite.10.'Berliner_et_al_2000}; {cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Terray_2012}), so ‘passing’ this test is not a safeguard against unrealistic variability, which is why estimates of internal variability are discussed in detail in this chapter and in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}.

A further consistency check often used in optimal fingerprinting is whether the estimated magnitude of the externally driven responses are consistent between model and observations (scaling factors consistent with unity in {Box_10_1 Box 10.1}): if they are not, attribution is still possible provided the discrepancy is explicable in terms of known {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the magnitude of either forcing or response. As is emphasized in {Chapters.10.10_2.10_2_1 Section 10.2.1} and {Box_10_1 Box 10.1}, attribution is not a purely statistical assessment: physical judgment is required to assess whether the combination of responses considered allows for all major potential confounding factors and whether any remaining discrepancies are consistent with a physically based understanding of the responses to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} and internal climate variability.
