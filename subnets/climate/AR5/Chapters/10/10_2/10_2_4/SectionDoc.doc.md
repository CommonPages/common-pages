title: 10.2.4 - Single-Step and Multi-Step Attribution and the Role of the Null Hypothesis

{Topics.*Attribution_of_Change Attribution studies} have traditionally involved explicit simulation of the response to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} of an observable variable, such as {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature}, and comparison with corresponding observations of that variable. This so-called ‘single-step attribution’ has the advantage of simplicity, but restricts attention to variables for which long and consistent time series of observations are available and that can be simulated explicitly in current models driven solely with external climate forcing.

To address attribution questions for variables for which these conditions are not satisfied, {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2010 Hegerl et al. (2010)} introduced the notation of ‘multi-step attribution’, formalizing existing practice (e.g., {cite.10.'Stott_et_al_2004}). In a multi-step attribution study, the attributable change in a variable such as large-scale {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} is estimated with a single-step procedure, along with its associated uncertainty, and the implications of this change are then explored in a further (physically or statistically based) modelling step. Overall conclusions can only be as robust as the least certain link in the multi-step procedure. As the focus shifts towards more noisy regional changes, it can be difficult to separate the effect of different {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}. In such cases, it can be useful to detect the response to all external forcings, and then determine the most important factors underlying the attribution results by reference to a closely related variable for which a full attribution analysis is available (e.g., {cite.10.'Morak_et_al_2011}).

{Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Attribution} results are typically expressed in terms of conventional ‘frequentist’ confidence intervals or results of hypothesis tests: when it is reported that the response to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} GHG increase is very likely greater than half the total observed warming, it means that the null hypothesis that the GHG-induced warming is less than half the total can be rejected with the data available at the 10% significance level. Expert judgment is required in frequentist attribution assessments, but its role is limited to the assessment of whether {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} and potential confounding factors have been adequately accounted for, and to downgrade nominal significance levels to account for remaining {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}. Uncertainties may, in some cases, be further reduced if prior expectations regarding attribution results themselves are incorporated, using a {Glossary.*Bayesian_method_approach Bayesian approach}, but this not currently the usual practice.

This traditional emphasis on single-step studies and placing lower bounds on the magnitude of signals under investigation means that, very often, the communication of attribution results tends to be conservative, with attention focussing on whether or not {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} in a particular variable might be zero, rather than the upper end of the confidence interval, which might suggest a possible response much bigger than current model-simulated changes. Consistent with previous Assessments and the majority of the literature, this chapter adopts this conservative emphasis. It should, however, be borne in mind that this means that positive attribution results will tend to be biased towards well-observed, well-modelled variables and regions, which should be taken into account in the compilation of global impact assessments ({cite.10.'Allen_2011}; {cite.10.'Trenberth_2011a}).
