title: 10.2.2 - Time Series Methods, Causality and Separating Signal from Noise

Some studies attempt to distinguish between externally driven climate change and changes due to internal variability minimizing the use of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, for example, by separating signal and noise by time scale ({cite.10.'Schneider_and_Held_2001}), spatial pattern ({cite.10.'Thompson_et_al_2009}) or both. Other studies use model control simulations to identify patterns of maximum {Glossary.*Predictability predictability} and contrast these with the forced component in climate model simulations ({cite.10.'DelSole_et_al_2011}): see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1 Section 10.3.1}. Conclusions of most studies are consistent with those based on {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution}, while using a different set of assumptions (see review in {cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011}).

A number of studies have applied methods developed in the econometrics literature ({cite.10.'Engle_and_Granger_1987}) to assess the evidence for a causal link between external drivers of climate and observed climate change, using the observations themselves to estimate the expected properties of internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} (e.g., {cite.10.'Kaufmann_and_Stern_1997}). The advantage of these approaches is that they do not depend on the accuracy of any complex global climate model, but they nevertheless have to assume some kind of model, or restricted class of models, of the properties of the variables under investigation. Attribution is impossible without a model: although this model may be implicit in the statistical framework used, it is important to assess its physical consistency ({cite.10.'Kaufmann_et_al_2013}). Many of these time series methods can be cast in the overall framework of co-integration and error correction ({cite.10.'Kaufmann_et_al_2011}), which is an approach to analysing relationships between stationary and non-stationary time series. If there is a consistent causal relationship between two or more possibly non-stationary time series, then it should be possible to find a linear combination such that the residual is stationary (contains no stochastic {Glossary.*Trend trend}) over time ({cite.10.'Kaufmann_and_Stern_2002}; {cite.10.'Kaufmann_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Mills_2009}). Co-integration methods are thus similar in overall principle to regression-based approaches (e.g., {cite.10.'Douglass_et_al_2004}; {cite.10.'Stone_and_Allen_2005}; {cite.10.'Lean_2006}) to the extent that regression studies take into account the expected time series properties of the data—the example described in {Box_10_1 Box 10.1} might be characterized as looking for a linear combination of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural forcings such that the observed residuals were consistent with internal climate variability as simulated by the CMIP5 models. Co-integration and error correction methods, however, generally make more explicit use of time series properties (notice how date information is effectively discarded in panel (b) of {Box_10_1 Box 10.1}, {'Box_10_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}) and require fewer assumptions about the stationarity of the input series.

All of these approaches are subject to the issue of confounding factors identified by {cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011 Hegerl and Zwiers (2011)}. For example, {cite.10.'Beenstock_et_al_2012 Beenstock et al. (2012)} fail to find a consistent co-integrating relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide ({Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}) concentrations and {Topics.*Surface_Temperature GMST} using polynomial cointegration tests, but the fact that CO2 concentrations are derived from different sources in different periods (ice cores prior to the mid-20th-century, atmospheric observations thereafter) makes it difficult to assess the physical significance of their result, particularly in the light of evidence for co-integration between temperature and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF) reported by {cite.10.'Kaufmann_et_al_2011 Kaufmann et al. (2011)} using tests of linear cointegration, and also the results of Gay-Garcia et al. (2009), who find evidence for {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} of climate using time series properties.

The assumptions of the statistical model employed can also influence results. For example, {cite.10.'Schlesinger_and_Ramankutty_1994 Schlesinger and Ramankutty (1994)} and {cite.10.'Zhou_and_Tung_2013a Zhou and Tung (2013a)} show that GMST are consistent with a linear anthropogenic trend, enhanced variability due to an approximately 70-year Atlantic Meridional Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}) and shorter-term variability. If, however, there are physical grounds to expect a nonlinear anthropogenic trend (see {Box_10_1 Box 10.1} Figure 1a), the assumption of a linear trend can itself enhance the variance assigned to a low-frequency oscillation. The fact that the AMO index is estimated from detrended historical temperature observations further increases the risk that its variance may be overestimated, because regressors and regressands are not independent. Folland et al. (2013), using a physically based estimate of the anthropogenic trend, find a smaller role for the AMO in recent warming.

Time series methods ultimately depend on the structural adequacy of the statistical model employed. Many such studies, for example, use models that assume a single exponential decay time for the response to both external forcing and stochastic fluctuations. This can lead to an overemphasis on short-term fluctuations, and is not consistent with the response of more complex models ({cite.10.'Knutti_et_al_2008}). {cite.10.'Smirnov_and_Mokhov_2009 Smirnov and Mokhov (2009)} propose an alternative characterization that allows them to distinguish a ‘long-term causality’ that focuses on low-frequency changes. Trends that appear significant when tested against an AR(1) model may not be significant when tested against a process that supports this ‘long-range dependence’ ({cite.10.'Franzke_2010}). Although the evidence for long-range dependence in global temperature data remains a topic of debate ({cite.10.'Mann_2011}; {cite.10.'Rea_et_al_2011}) , it is generally desirable to explore sensitivity of results to the specification of the statistical model, and also to other methods of estimating the properties of internal variability, such as more complex climate models, discussed next. For example, {cite.10.'Imbers_et_al_2013 Imbers et al. (2013)} demonstrate that the detection of the influence of increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} in the global temperature record is robust to the assumption of a Fractional Differencing (FD) model of internal variability, which supports long-range dependence.
