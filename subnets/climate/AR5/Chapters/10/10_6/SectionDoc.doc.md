title: 10.6 - Extremes

Because many of the impacts of climate changes may manifest themselves through weather and climate extremes, there is increasing interest in quantifying the role of human and other external influences on those extremes. SREX assessed causes of changes in different types of extremes including temperature and precipitation, phenomena that influence the occurrence of extremes (e.g., storms, tropical cyclones), and impacts on the natural physical environment such as {Glossary.*Drought drought} ({cite.10.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). This section assesses current understanding of causes of changes in weather and climate extremes, using {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} as a starting point. Any changes or modifications to SREX assessment are highlighted.
