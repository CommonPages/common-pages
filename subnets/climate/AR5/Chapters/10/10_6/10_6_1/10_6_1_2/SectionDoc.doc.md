title: 10.6.1.2 - Precipitation Extremes

Observations have showed a general increase in heavy precipitation at the global scale. This appears to be consistent with the expected response to anthropogenic forcing as a result of an enhanced moisture content in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} but a direct cause-and-effect relationship between changes in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} and extreme precipitation had not been established at the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. As a result, the AR4 concluded that increases in heavy precipitation were more likely than not consistent with anthropogenic influence during the latter half of the 20th century ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}).

Extreme precipitation is expected to increase with warming. A combination of evidence leads to this conclusion though by how much remains uncertain and may vary with time scale ({Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_5 Section 7.6.5}). Observations and model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} future changes both indicate increase in extreme precipitation associated with warming. Analysis of observed annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) over global land areas with sufficient data smaples indicates a significant increase in extreme percipitation globally, with a median increase about 7% °C–1 {Topics.*Surface_Temperature GMST} increase ({cite.10.'Westra_et_al_2013}). CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations project an increase in the globally averaged 20-year return values of annual maximum 24-hour precipitation amounts of about 6 to 7% with each degree Celsius of global mean warming, with the bulk of models simulating values in the range of 4 to 10% °C–1({cite.10.'Kharin_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Kharin_et_al_2013}). {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} influence has been detected on various aspects of the global {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} ({cite.10.'Stott_et_al_2010}), which is directly relevant to extreme precipitation changes. An anthropogenic influence on increasing atmospheric moisture content has been detected (see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2 Section 10.3.2}). A higher moisture content in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} would be expected to lead to stronger extreme precipitation as extreme precipitation typically scales with total column moisture if circulation does not change. An observational analysis shows that winter maximum daily precipitation in North America has statistically significant positive correlations with local atmospheric moisture ({cite.10.'Wang_and_Zhang_2008}).

There is only a modest body of direct evidence that natural or anthropogenic forcing has affected global mean precipitation (see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2 Section 10.3.2} and {'Figure_10_10 Figure 10.10}), despite a robust expectation of increased precipitation (Balan Sarojini et al., 2012 ) and precipitation extremes (see {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_5 Section 7.6.5}). However, mean precipitation is expected to increase less than extreme precipitation because of energy constraints (e.g., {cite.10.'Allen_and_Ingram_2002}). A perfect model analysis with an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations shows that anthropogenic influence should be detectable in precipitation extremes in the second half of the 20th century at global and hemispheric scales, and at continental scale as well but less robustly (Min et al., 2008c), see also {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2004 Hegerl et al. (2004)}. One study has also linked the observed intensification of precipitation extremes (including RX1day and annual maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5day)) over NH land areas to {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} using a limited set of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} and observations ({cite.10.'Min_et_al_2011}). However, the detection was less robust if using the {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} for combined anthropogenic and natural influences compared to that for anthropogenic influences only, possibly due to a number of factors including weak S/N ratio and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in observation and model simulations. Also, models still have difficulties in simulating extreme daily precipitation directly comparable with those observed at the station level, which has been addressed to some extent by {cite.10.'Min_et_al_2011 Min et al. (2011)} by independently transforming annual precipitation extremes in models and observations onto a dimensionless scale that may be more comparable between the two. {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} of anthropogenic influence on smaller spatial scales is more difficult due to the increased level of noise and uncertainties and confounding factors on local scales. {cite.10.'Fowler_and_Wilby_2010 Fowler and Wilby (2010)} suggested that there may have only been a 50% {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of detecting anthropogenic influence on UK extreme precipitation in winter at that time, and a very small likelihood of detecting it in other seasons.

Given the evidence of anthropogenic influence on various aspects of the global hydrological cycle that implies that extreme precipitation would be expected to have increased and some limited direct evidence of anthropogenic influence on extreme precipitation, but given also the difficulties in simulating extreme precipitation by climate models and limited observational coverage, we assess, consistent with SREX ({cite.10.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}) that there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century in land regions where observational coverage is sufficient for assessment.
