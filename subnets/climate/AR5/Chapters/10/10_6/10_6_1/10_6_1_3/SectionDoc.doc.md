{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that that an increased risk of drought was more likely than not due to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing during the second half of the 20th century. This assessment was based on one {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} study that identified an anthropogenic {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} in a global Palmer {Glossary.*Drought Drought} Severity Index (PDSI) data set ({cite.10.'Burke_et_al_2006}) and studies of some regions which indicated that droughts in those regions were linked to {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} changes or to a circulation response to anthropogenic forcing. SREX ({cite.10.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}) assessed that there was medium confidence that anthropogenic influence has contributed to some changes in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20th century based on {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} impact of anthropogenic forcing on precipitation and temperature changes, and that there was low confidence in the assessment of changes in drought at the level of single regions.

Drought is a complex phenomenon that is affected by precipitation predominantly, as well as by other climate variables including temperature, wind speed and {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} (e.g., {cite.10.'Seneviratne_2012}; {cite.10.'Sheffield_et_al_2012}). It is also affected by non-atmospheric conditions such as antecedent {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} and land surface conditions. Trends in two important drought-related climate variables (precipitation and temperature) are consistent with the expected responses to anthropogenic forcing over the globe. However, there is large uncertainty in observed changes in drought ({Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_2.2_6_2_3 Section 2.6.2.3}) and its attribution to causes globally. The evidence for changes in soil moisture indices and drought indices over the period since 1950 globally is conflicting ({cite.10.'Hoerling_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Sheffield_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Dai_2013}), possibly due to the examination of different time periods, different forcing fields used to drive land surface models and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in land surface models ({cite.10.'Pitman_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Seneviratne_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Sheffield_et_al_2012}). In a recent study, {cite.10.'Sheffield_et_al_2012 Sheffield et al. (2012)} identify the representation of potential evaporation as solely dependent on temperature (using the Thornthwaite-based formulation) as a possible explanation for their finding that PDSI-based estimates might overestimate historical drought trends. This stands in partial contradiction to previous assessments suggesting that using a more sophisticated formulation (Penman-Monteith) for potential evaporation did not affect the results of respective PDSI trends ({cite.10.'Dai_2011}; van der Schrier et al., 2011). {cite.10.'Sheffield_et_al_2012 Sheffield et al. (2012)} argue that issues with the treatment of spurious trends in atmospheric forcing data sets and/or the choice of calibration periods explain these conflicting results. These conflicting results point out the challenges in quantitatively defining and detecting long-term changes in a multivariable phenomenon such as drought.

Recent long-term droughts in western North America cannot definitively be shown to lie outside the very large envelope of natural precipitation variability in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.10.'Cayan_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Seager_et_al_2010}), particularly given new evidence of the history of high-magnitude natural drought and pluvial episodes suggested by palaeoclimatic reconstructions (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}). Low-frequency tropical ocean temperature anomalies in all ocean basins appear to force circulation changes that promote regional drought ({cite.10.'Hoerling_and_Kumar_2003}; {cite.10.'Seager_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Dai_2011}). Uniform increases in SST are not particularly effective in this regard ({cite.10.'Schubert_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Hoerling_et_al_2012}). Therefore, the reliable separation of natural variability and forced climate change will require simulations that accurately reproduce changes in largescale SST gradients at all time scales.

In summary, assessment of new observational evidence, in conjunction with updated simulations of natural and forced {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, indicates that the AR4 conclusions regarding global increasing trends in droughts since the 1970s should be tempered. There is not enough evidence to support medium or high confidence of attribution of increasing trends to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} as a result of observational uncertainties and variable results from region to region ({Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_2.2_6_2_3 Section 2.6.2.3}). Combined with difficulties described above in distinguishing decadal scale variability in drought from long-term climate change we conclude consistent with SREX that there is low confidence in detection and attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th century.
