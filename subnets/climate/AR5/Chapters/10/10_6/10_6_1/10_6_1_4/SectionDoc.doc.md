title: 10.6.1.4 - Extratropical Cyclones

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that an {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} influence on extratropical cyclones was not formally detected, owing to large {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} and problems due to changes in observing systems. Although there is evidence that there has been a poleward shift in the {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} (see {Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_4 Section 2.6.4}), various causal factors have been cited including oceanic heating ({cite.10.'Butler_et_al_2010}) and changes in large-scale circulation due to effects of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3 Section 10.3.3}). Increases in mid-latitude {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradients generally lead to stronger storm tracks that are shifted poleward and increases in subtropical SST gradients may lead to storm tracks shifting towards the equator ({cite.10.'Brayshaw_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Semmler_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Kodama_and_Iwasaki_2009}; {cite.10.'Graff_and_LaCasce_2012}). However, changes in storm-track intensity are much more complicated, as they are sensitive to the competing effects of changes in temperature gradients and static stability at different levels and are thus not linked to {Topics.*Surface_Temperature GMST} in a simple way ({cite.10.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}; O’Gorman, 2010). Overall global average cyclone activity is expected to change little under moderate GHG forcing (O’Gorman and Schneider, 2008; {cite.10.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Bengtsson_and_Hodges_2011}), although in one study, {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} has been detected in geostrophic wind energy and ocean wave heights derived from {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure data ({cite.10.'Wang_et_al_2009b}).
