title: 10.6.1 - Attribution of Changes in Frequency/ Occurrence and Intensity of Extremes
section 10_6_1

  |We assess that it is very likely that {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} has contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily {Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} on the global scale since the mid-20th century. There is medium confidence that {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing has contributed to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century. There is not enough evidence to attibute increasing trends in droughts since the 1970s to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings}. An anthropogenic influence on extratropical cyclones has not been formally detected. Globally, there is low confidence in any long-term increases in tropical cyclone activity and we assess that there is low confidence in attributing global changes to any particular cause.
