  |Many of the impacts of climate changes may manifest themselves through weather and climate extremes, including temperature and precipitation, storms, tropical cyclones and droughts. It is very likely that {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} has contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily {Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} since the mid-20th century. There is medium confidence that {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing has contributed to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century. There is not enough evidence to attibute increasing trends in droughts or cyclones to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings}. It is likely that human influence has substantially increased the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations.
