title: 10.7.1.3 - Estimates of Internal Climate Variability

The interdecadal and longer-term variability in large-scale temperatures in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} simulations with and without past {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} is quite different ({cite.10.'Tett_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Jungclaus_et_al_2010}), consistent with the finding that a large fraction of temperature variance in the last millennium has been externally driven. The residual variability in {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} that is not explained by changes in RF provides an estimate of {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} for NH mean temperature that is not directly derived from climate model simulation. This residual variability is somewhat larger than control simulation variability for some reconstructions if the comparison is extended to the full period since 850 CE ({cite.10.'Schurer_et_al_2013}), However, when extracting 50and 60-year trends from this residual variability, the distribution of these trends is similar to the multi-model control simulation {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} used in {cite.10.'Schurer_et_al_2013 Schurer et al. (2013)}. In all cases considered, the most recent 50-and 60-year {Glossary.*Trend trend} from instrumental data is far outside the range of any 50-year trend in residuals from reconstructions of NH mean temperature of the past millennium.
