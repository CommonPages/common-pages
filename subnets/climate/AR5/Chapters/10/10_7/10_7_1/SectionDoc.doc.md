title: 10.7.1 - Causes of Change in Large-Scale Temperature over the Past Millennium

Despite the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in reconstructions of past NH mean temperatures, there are well-defined climatic episodes in the last millennium that can be robustly identified ({Chapters.5 Chapter 5}, see also {'Figure_10_19 Figure 10.19}). {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} concludes that in response to solar, volcanic and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} RFs, {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} simulate temperature changes in the NH which are generally consistent in magnitude and timing with reconstructions, within their broad uncertainty ranges ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5 Section 5.3.5}).
