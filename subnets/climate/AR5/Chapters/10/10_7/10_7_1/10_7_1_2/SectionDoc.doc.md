title: 10.7.1.2 - Role of Individual Forcings

Volcanic forcing shows a detectable influence on large-scale temperature (see {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}; {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}), and volcanic forcing plays an important role in explaining past cool episodes, for example, in the late 17th and early 19th centuries (see Chapters {Chapters.5} and {Chapters.9}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.10.'Jungclaus_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Miller_et_al_2012}) . {cite.10.'Schurer_et_al_2013 Schurer et al. (2013)} separately detect the response to GHG variations between 1400 and 1900 in most NH reconstructions considered, and that of solar and volcanic forcing combined in all reconstructions considered.

Even the multi-century perspective makes it difficult to distinguish century-scale variations in NH temperature due to solar forcing alone from the response to other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, due to the few degrees of freedom constraining this forcing (see {Box_10_2 Box 10.2}). Hegerl et al. (2003, 2007a) found solar forcing detectable in some cases. Simulations with higher than best guess solar forcing may reproduce the warm period around 1000 more closely, but the peak warming occurs about a century earlier in reconstructions than in solar forcing and with it model simulations ({cite.10.'Jungclaus_et_al_2010}; {'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}; FernaÃÅndez-Donado et al., 2013). Even if solar forcing were on the high end of estimates for the last millennium, it would not be able to explain the recent warming according both to model simulations ({cite.10.'Ammann_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Tett_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Feulner_2011}) and {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} approaches that scale the temporal {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} of solar forcing to best match the data ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007a}; {cite.10.'Schurer_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_10_19 Figure 10.19}). Some studies suggest that particularly for millennial and multi-millenial time scales orbital forcing may be important globally ({cite.10.'Marcott_et_al_2013}) and for high-latitude trends ({cite.10.'Kaufman_et_al_2009}) based on a comparison of the correspondence between long-term Arctic cooling in models and data though the last millennium up to about 1750 (see also PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013).
