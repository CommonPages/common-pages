title: 10.7 - Multi-century to Millennia Perspective

Evaluating the causes of climate change before the 20th century is important to test and improve our understanding of the role of internal and forced natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} for the recent past. This section draws on assessment of temperature reconstructions of climate change over the past millennium and their uncertainty in {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} (Table 5.A.1; Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5 5.3.5} and {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1 5.5.1} for regional records), and on comparisons of models and data over the pre-instrumental period in Chapters {Chapters.5} and {Chapters.9} (Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5 5.3.5}, {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1 5.5.1} and {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 9.5.3}), and focuses on the evidence for the contribution by radiatively forced climate change to reconstructions and early instrumental records. In addition, the residual variability that is not explained by forcing from palaeoclimatic records provides a useful comparison to estimates of climate model internal variability. The model dependence of estimates of internal variability is an important uncertainty in {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and attribution results.

The inputs for detection and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} for periods covered by indirect, or {Glossary.*Proxy proxy}, data are affected by more uncertainty than those from the instrumental period (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}), owing to the sparse data coverage, particularly further back in time, and uncertainty in the link between proxy data and, for example, temperature. Records of past radiative influences on climate are also uncertain ({Chapters.5.5_2 Section 5.2}; see {cite.10.'Schmidt_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Schmidt_et_al_2012}). For the preindustrial part of the last millennium changes in solar, volcanic, GHG forcing, and {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}, along with a small orbital forcing are potentially important external drivers of climate change. Estimates of solar forcing ({'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}a; {Box_10_2 Box 10.2}) are uncertain, particularly in their amplitude, as well as in modelling, for example, of the influence of solar forcing on atmospheric circulation involving stratospheric dynamics (see {Box_10_2 Box 10.2}; {cite.10.'Gray_et_al_2010}). Estimates of past volcanism are reasonably well established in their timing, but the magnitude of the RF of individual eruptions is uncertain ({'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}a). It is possible that large eruptions had a more moderated climate effect than simulated by many {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} due to faster fallout associated with larger particle size ({cite.10.'Timmreck_et_al_2009}), or increased amounts of injected water vapour ({cite.10.'Joshi_and_Jones_2009}). Reconstructed changes in land cover and its effect on climate are also uncertain ({cite.10.'Kaplan_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Pongratz_et_al_2009}). Forcing of {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} shows only very subtle variations over the last millennium up to 1750. This includes a small drop and partial recovery in the 17th century ({Chapters.6.6_2.6_2_3 Section 6.2.3}, {'Figure_6_7 Figure 6.7}), followed by increases in GHG concentrations with industrialization since the middle of the 18th century (middle of the 19th century for {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}, {'Figure_6_11 Figure 6.11}).

When interpreting reconstructions of {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} change with the help of climate models driven with estimates of past forcing, it helps that the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in reconstructions and forcing are independent from each other. Thus, uncertainties in forcing and reconstructions combined should lead to less, rather than more similarity between fingerprints of forced climate change and reconstructions, making it improbable that the response to external drivers is spuriously detected. However, this is the case only if all relevant forcings and their uncertainties are considered, reducing the risk of misattribution due to spurious correlations between {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}, and if the data are homogeneous and statistical tests properly applied (e.g., {cite.10.'Legras_et_al_2010}). Hence this section focuses on work that considers all relevant forcings simultaneously.
