A number of studies since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} have addressed the possible influences of long-term fluctuations of solar irradiance on {Topics.*Past_Climate past climates}, particularly related to the relative warmth of the Medieval Climate Anomaly ({Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA}) and the relative coolness in the Little Ice Age ({Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA}). There is medium confidence that both external solar and volcanic forcing, and {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}, contributed substantially to the spatial patterns of {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} changes between the MCA and the LIA, but very low confidence in quantitative estimates of their relative contributions (Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_3 5.3.5.3} and {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1 5.5.1}). The combined influence of volcanism, solar forcing and a small drop in greenhouse gases ({Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}) likely contributed to Northern Hemisphere cooling during the LIA ({Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_2 Section 10.7.2}). Solar {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF) from the Maunder Minimum (1745) to the satellite era (average of 1976–2006) has been estimated to be +0.08 to +0.18 W m–2 (low confidence, {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_2 Section 8.4.1.2}). This may have contributed to early 20th century warming (low confidence, {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1 Section 10.3.1}).

More recently, it is extremely unlikely that the contribution from solar forcing to the observed global warming since 1950 was larger than that from GHGs ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_3 Section 10.3.1.1.3}). It is very likely that there has been a small decrease in solar forcing of –0.04 [–0.08 to 0.00] W m–2 over a period with direct satellite measurements of solar output from 1986 to 2008 ({Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_1 Section 8.4.1.1}). There is high confidence that changes in total solar irradiance have not contributed to global warming during that period.

Since AR4, there has been considerable new research that has connected solar forcing to climate. The effect of solar forcing on GMST trends has been found to be small, with less than 0.1°C warming attributable to combined solar and volcanic forcing over the 1951– 2010 period ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1 Section 10.3.1}), although the 11-year cycle of solar variability has been found to have some influence on GMST variability over the 20th century. GMST changes between solar maxima and minima are estimated to be of order 0.1°C from some regression studies of GMST and forcing estimates ({'Figure_10_6 Figure 10.6}), although several studies have suggested these results may be too large owing to issues including degeneracy between forcing and with internal variability, overfitting of forcing indices and underestimated {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in responses ({cite.10.'Ingram_2007}; {cite.10.'Benestad_and_Schmidt_2009}; {cite.10.'Stott_and_Jones_2009}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} generally show less than half this variability ({cite.10.'Jones_et_al_2012}).

Variability associated with the 11-year {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} has also been shown to produce measurable short-term regional and seasonal climate anomalies ({cite.10.'Miyazaki_and_Yasunari_2008}; {cite.10.'Gray_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Lockwood_2012}; National Research Council, 2012) particularly in the Indo-Pacific, Northern Asia and North Atlantic regions (medium evidence). For example, studies have suggested an 11-year solar response in the Indo-Pacific {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} in which the equatorial eastern Pacific sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} (SSTs) tend to be below normal, the {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure (SLP) in the Gulf of Alaska and the South Pacific above normal, and the tropical convergence zones on both hemispheres strengthened and displaced polewards under solar maximum conditions, although it can be difficult to discriminate the solar-forced signal from the El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}) signal (van Loon et al., 2007; van Loon and Meehl, 2008; {cite.10.'White_and_Liu_2008}; {cite.10.'Meehl_and_Arblaster_2009}; {cite.10.'Roy_and_Haigh_2010}, 2012; {cite.10.'Tung_and_Zhou_2010}; {cite.10.'Bal_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Haam_and_Tung_2012}; {cite.10.'Hood_and_Soukharev_2012}; {cite.10.'Misios_and_Schmidt_2012}). For northern summer, there is evidence that for peaks in the 11-year solar cycle, the Indian {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} is intensified ({cite.10.'Kodera_2004}; van Loon and Meehl, 2012), with solar variability affecting interannual connections between the Indian and Pacific sectors due to a shift in the location of the descending branch of the {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.10.'Kodera_et_al_2007}). In addition, model sensitivity experiments ({cite.10.'Ineson_et_al_2011}) suggest that the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}) is more prevalent during solar minima and there is some evidence of this in observations, including an indication of increased frequency of high-pressure ‘{Glossary.*Blocking blocking}’ events over Europe in winter ({cite.10.'Barriopedro_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Lockwood_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Woollings_et_al_2010}).

Two mechanisms have been identified in observations and simulated with climate models that could explain these low amplitude regional responses ({cite.10.'Gray_et_al_2010}; medium evidence). These mechanisms are additive and may reinforce one another so that the response to an initial small change in solar irradiance is amplified regionally ({cite.10.'Meehl_et_al_2009}). The first mechanism is a top-down mechanism first noted by {cite.10.'Haigh_1996 Haigh (1996)} where greater solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) in peak solar years warms the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} directly via increased radiation and indirectly via increased {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} production. This can result in a chain of processes that influences deep tropical {Glossary.*Convection convection} ({cite.10.'Balachandran_et_al_1999}; {cite.10.'Shindell_et_al_1999}; {cite.10.'Kodera_and_Kuroda_2002}; {cite.10.'Haigh_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Kodera_2006}; {cite.10.'Matthes_et_al_2006}). In addition, there is less heating than average in the tropical upper stratosphere under solar minimum conditions which weakens the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. This signal can propagate downward to weaken the tropospheric mid-latitude westerlies, thus favoring a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) or NAO. This response has been shown in several models (e.g., {cite.10.'Shindell_et_al_2001}; {cite.10.'Ineson_et_al_2011}) though there is no significant AO or NAO response to solar irradiance variations on average in the CMIP5 models ({cite.10.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013}).

The second mechanism is a bottom-up mechanism that involves coupled air–sea radiative processes in the tropical and subtropical Pacific that also influence convection in the deep tropics ({cite.10.'Meehl_et_al_2003}, 2008; {cite.10.'Rind_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Bal_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Cai_and_Tung_2012}; {cite.10.'Zhou_and_Tung_2013b}). Such mechanisms have also been shown to influence regional temperatures over longer time scales (decades to centuries), and can help explain patterns of regional temperature changes seen in {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} data (e.g., {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_2 Section 10.7.2}; {cite.10.'Mann_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Goosse_et_al_2012b}) although they have little effect on global or hemispheric mean temperatures at either short or long time scales.

A possible amplifying mechanism linking solar variability and the Earth’s climate system via cosmic rays has been postulated. It is proposed that variations in the cosmic ray flux associated with changes in solar magnetic activity affect ion-induced {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} nucleation and cloud condensation nuclei ({Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN}) production in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_6 Section 7.4.6}). A strong solar magnetic field would deflect cosmic rays and lead to fewer CCN and less cloudiness, thereby allowing for more solar energy into the system. Since AR4, there has been further evidence to disprove the importance of this amplifying mechanism. Correlations between cosmic ray flux and observed aerosol or cloud properties are weak and local at best, and do not prove to be robust on the regional or global scale ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_6 Section 7.4.6}). Although there is some evidence that ionization from cosmic rays may enhance aerosol nucleation in the free troposphere, there is medium evidence and high agreement that the cosmic ray–ionization mechanism is too weak to influence global concentrations of CCN or their change over the last century or during a solar cycle in any climatically significant way (Sections {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_6 7.4.6} and {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_5 8.4.1.5}). The lack of {Glossary.*Trend trend} in cosmic ray intensity over the 1960–2005 period ({cite.10.'McCracken_and_Beer_2007}) provides another argument against the hypothesis of a major contribution of cosmic ray variations to the observed warming over that period given the existence of short time scales in the climate system response.

Thus, although there is medium confidence that solar variability has made contributions to past climate fluctuations, since the mid20th century there has been little trend in solar forcing. There are at least two amplifying mechanisms that have been proposed and simulated in some models that could explain small observed regional and seasonal climate anomalies associated with the 11-year solar cycle, mostly in the Indo-Pacific region and northern mid to high latitudes.

Regarding possible future influences of the sun on the Earth’s climate, there is very low confidence in our ability to predict future solar output, but there is high confidence that the effects from solar irradiance variations will be much smaller than the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} climate changes from increased RF due to GHGs (Sections {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_3 8.4.1.3} and {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_2.11_3_6_2_2 11.3.6.2.2}).
