title: 10.9.2 - Whole Climate System

To demonstrate how observed changes across the climate system can be understood in terms of natural and anthropogenic causes {'Figure_10_21 Figure 10.21} compares observed and modelled changes in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, ocean and {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}. The instrumental records associated with each element of the climate system are generally independent (see {FAQ_2_1 FAQ 2.1}), and consequently joint interpretations across observations from the main components of the climate system increases the confidence to higher levels than from any single study or component of the climate system. The ability of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} to replicate observed changes (to within {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}) across a wide suite of climate indicators also builds confidence in the capacity of the models to simulate the Earth’s climate.

The coherence of observed changes for the variables shown in {'Figure_10_21 Figure 10.21} with climate model simulations that include anthropogenic and natural forcing is remarkable. Surface temperatures over land, SSTs and ocean heat content changes show emerging anthropogenic and natural signals with a clear separation between the observed changes and the alternative hypothesis of just natural variations ({'Figure_10_21 Figure 10.21}, Global panels). These signals appear not just in the global means, but also at continental and ocean basin scales in these variables. {Glossary.*Sea_ice Sea ice} emerges strongly from the range expected from natural variability for the Arctic and Antarctica remains broadly within the range of natural variability consistent with expectations from model simulations including {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings}.

{'Table_10_1 Table 10.1} illustrates a larger suite of {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and attribution results across the climate system than summarized in {'Figure_10_21 Figure 10.21}. These results include observations from both the instrumental record and paleo-reconstructions on a range of time scales ranging from daily extreme precipitation events to variability over millennium time scales.

From up in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}, down through the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} to the surface of the Earth and into the depths of the oceans there are detectable signals of change such that the assessed {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of a detectable, and often quantifiable, human contribution ranges from likely to extremely likely for many climate variables ({'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). Indeed to successfully describe the observed warming trends in the atmosphere, ocean and at the surface over the past 50 years, contributions from both anthropogenic and natural forcings are required (e.g., results 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 in {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). This is consistent with anthropogenic forcings warming the surface of the Earth, troposphere and oceans superimposed with cooling events caused by the three large explosive volcanic eruptions since the 1960’s. These two effects (anthropogenic warming and volcanic eruptions) cause much of the observed response (see also {'Figure_10_5 Figures 10.5}, 10.6, 10.9, 10.14a and 10.21). Both natural and anthropogenic forcings are required to understand fully the variability of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} during the past 50 years.

Water in the {Glossary.*Free_atmosphere free atmosphere} is expected to increase, as a consequence of warming of the atmosphere ({Chapters.10.10_6.10_6_1 Section 10.6.1}), and atmospheric circulation controls the global distribution of precipitation and evaporation. Simulations show that {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} increase moisture in the atmosphere and change its transport in such a way as to produce patterns of precipitation and evaporation that are quite distinct from the observed patterns of warming. Our assessment shows that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to observed increases in moisture content in the atmosphere (result 16, medium confidence, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}), to global scale changes in precipitation patterns over land (result 14, medium confidence), to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation in land regions where there observational coverage is sufficient to make an assessment (result 15, medium confidence), and to changes in surface and sub-surface ocean salinity (result 11, very likely). Combining evidence from both atmosphere and ocean that systematic changes in precipitation over land and ocean salinity can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} supports an assessment that it is likely that human influence has affected the global {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} since 1960.

Warming of the atmosphere and the oceans affects the cryosphere, and in the case of snow and sea ice warming leads to positive feedbacks that amplify the warming response in the atmosphere and oceans. Retreat of mountain glaciers has been observed with an anthropogenic influence detected (result 17, likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}), Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} has melted at the edges and accumulating snow at the higher elevations is consistent with GHG warming supporting an assessment for an anthropogenic influence on the negative surface mass balance of Greenland’s ice sheet (result 18, likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). Our level of scientific understanding is too low to provide a quantifiable explanation of the observed mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet (low confidence, result 19, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). Sea ice in the Arctic is decreasing rapidly and the changes now exceed internal variability and with an anthropogenic contribution detected (result 20, very likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). Antarctic sea ice extent has grown overall over the last 30 years but there is low scientific understanding of the spatial variability and changes in Antarctic sea ice extent (result 21, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). There is evidence for an anthropogenic component to observed reductions in NH snow cover since the 1970s (likely, result 22, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}).

{Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} forcing has also affected temperature on continental scales, with human influences having made a substantial contribution to warming in each of the inhabited continents (results 28, likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}), and having contributed to the very substantial Arctic warming over the past 50 years (result 29, likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}) while because of large observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} there is low confidence in attribution of warming averaged over available stations over Antarctica (result 30, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). There is also evidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to temperature change in many sub-continental regions (result 32, likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}) and that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed changes in the frequency and intensity of daily {Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} on the global scale since the mid-20th century (result 8, very likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}). Furthermore there is evidence that human influence has substantially increased the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations (result 33, likely, {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}).

An analysis of these results (from {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1}) shows that there is high confidence in attributing many aspects of changes in the climate system to human influence including from atmospheric measurements of temperature. Synthesizing the results in {'Table_10_1 Table 10.1} shows that the combined evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessments based on a single variable. From this combined evidence, it is virtually certain that human influence has warmed the global climate system.
