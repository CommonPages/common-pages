title: 10.9 - Synthesis

The evidence has grown since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 Fourth Assessment Report} that widespread changes observed in the climate system since the 1950s are attributable to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} influences. This evidence is documented in the preceding sections of this chapter, including for near {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1 Section 10.3.1.1}), free {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} temperatures ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_2 Section 10.3.1.2}), atmospheric moisture content ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2.10_3_2_1 Section 10.3.2.1}), precipitation over land ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2.10_3_2_2 Section 10.3.2.2}), ocean heat content ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_1 Section 10.4.1}), ocean salinity ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_2 Section 10.4.2}), {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_3 Section 10.4.3}), Arctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} ({Chapters.10.10_5.10_5_1 Section 10.5.1}), climate extremes ({Chapters.10.10_6 Section 10.6}) and evidence from the last millenium ({Chapters.10.10_7 Section 10.7}). These results strengthen the conclusion that {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} on climate has played the dominant role in observed warming since the 1950s. However, the approach taken so far in this chapter has been to examine each aspect of the climate system—the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, oceans, {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}, extremes, and from {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} archives—separately in each section and sub-section. In this section we look across the whole climate system to assess the extent that a consistent picture emerges across sub-systems and climate variables.
