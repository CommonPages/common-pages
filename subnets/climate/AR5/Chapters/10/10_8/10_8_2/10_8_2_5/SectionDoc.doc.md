title: 10.8.2.5 - Combining Evidence and Overall Assessment

Most studies find a lower 5% limit for ECS between 1°C and 2°C ({'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}). The combined evidence thus indicates that the net feedbacks to RF are significantly positive. At present, there is no credible individual line of evidence that yields very high or very low {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} as best estimate. Some recent studies suggest a low climate sensitivity ({cite.10.'Chylek_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Schwartz_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Lindzen_and_Choi_2009}). However, these are based on problematic assumptions, for example, about the climate’s {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time}, the cause of climate fluctuations, or neglect {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}, observations and {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} (as discussed in {cite.10.'Foster_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}; {cite.10.'Murphy_and_Forster_2010}). In some cases the estimates of the ECS have been refuted by testing the method of estimation with a {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} of known sensitivity (e.g., Kirk-Davidoff, 2009).

Several authors ({cite.10.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2006}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2010}) had proposed combining estimates of climate sensitivity from different lines of evidence by the time of {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}; these and recent work is shown in the panel ‘combined’ in {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}. {cite.10.'Aldrin_et_al_2012 Aldrin et al. (2012)} combined the {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2006 Hegerl et al. (2006)} estimate based on the last millennium with their estimate based on the 20th century; and {cite.10.'Olson_et_al_2012 Olson et al. (2012)} combined weak constraints from climatology and the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} in their prior, updated by data on temperature changes. This approach is robust only if the lines of evidence used are truly independent. The latter is hard to evaluate when using prior distributions based on expert knowledge (e.g., {cite.10.'Libardoni_and_Forest_2011}). If lines of evidence are not independent, overly confident assessments of {Glossary.*Equilibrium_climate_sensitivity equilibrium climate sensitivity} may result ({cite.10.'Henriksson_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2011}).

In conclusion, estimates of the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) based on multiple and partly independent lines of evidence from observed climate change, including estimates using longer records of {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} change and new palaeoclimatic evidence, indicate that there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than 1°C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5°C and 4.5°C and very unlikely greater than 6°C. They complement the evaluation in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9} and support the overall assessment in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12} that concludes between all lines of evidence with high confidence that ECS is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C. {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} feedbacks can lead to different, probably larger, warming than indicated by ECS on very long time scales.
