title: 10.8.2 - Constraints on Long-Term Climate Change and the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity

The equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (ECS) is defined as the warming in response to a sustained doubling of carbon dioxide in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} relative to pre-industrial levels (see {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}). The equilibrium to which the ECS refers to is generally assumed to be an equilibrium involving the ocean–atmosphere system, which does not include {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} feedbacks such as long-term melting of ice sheets and ice caps, dust forcing or vegetation changes (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} and {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}). The ECS cannot be directly deduced from transient warming attributable to {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, or from TCR, as the role of ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} has to be taken into account (see {cite.10.'Forest_et_al_2000}; {cite.10.'Frame_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}). Estimating the ECS generally relies on the paradigm of a comparison of observed change with results from a physically based {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model}, sometimes a very simple one, given uncertainty in the model, data, RF and due to internal variability.

For example, estimates can be based on the simple box model introduced in {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_1 Section 10.8.1}, ECS = F2×{Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ΔT/(ΔF – ΔQ). Simple {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} calculations rely on a very limited representation of climate {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} scales, and cannot account for nonlinearities in the climate system that may lead to changes in feedbacks for different {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} (see {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}). Alternative approaches are estimates that use climate model ensembles with varying parameters that evaluate the ECS of individual models and then infer the probability density function ({Glossary.*Probability_Density_Function PDF}) for the ECS from the model–data agreement or by using optimization methods ({cite.10.'Tanaka_et_al_2009}).

As discussed in the AR4, the probabilistic estimates available in the literature for climate system parameters, such as ECS and TCR have all been based, implicitly or explicitly, on adopting a {Glossary.*Bayesian_method_approach Bayesian approach} and therefore, even if it is not explicitly stated, involve using some kind of prior information. The shape of the prior has been derived from expert judgement in some studies, observational or experimental evidence in others or from the distribution of the sample of models available. In all cases the constraint by data, for example, from transient warming, or observations related to feedbacks is fairly weak on the upper tail of ECS (e.g., {cite.10.'Frame_et_al_2005}). Therefore, results are sensitive to the prior assumptions ({cite.10.'Tomassini_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}; {cite.10.'Sanso_and_Forest_2009}; {cite.10.'Aldrin_et_al_2012}). When the prior distribution fails to taper off for high sensitivities, as is the case for uniform priors ({cite.10.'Frame_et_al_2005}), this leads to long tails ({cite.10.'Frame_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2011}; {cite.10.'Lewis_2013}). Uniform priors have been criticized (e.g., {cite.10.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2011}; {cite.10.'Pueyo_2012}; {cite.10.'Lewis_2013}) since results assuming a uniform prior in ECS translates instead into a strongly structured prior on climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} parameter and vice versa ({cite.10.'Frame_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Pueyo_2012}). Objective Bayesian analyses attempt to avoid this paradox by using a prior distribution that is invariant to parameter transforms and rescaling, for example, a Jeffreys prior ({cite.10.'Lewis_2013}). Estimated probability densities based on priors that are strongly non-uniform in the vicinity of the best fit to the data, as is typically the case for the Jeffreys prior in this instance, can peak at values very different from the location of the best fit, and hence need to be interpreted carefully. To what extent results are sensitive to priors can be evaluated by using different priors, and this has been done more consistently in studies than at the time of AR4 (see {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}b) and is assessed where available, illustrated in {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}. Results will also be sensitive to the extent to which {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in forcing ({cite.10.'Tanaka_et_al_2009}), models and observations and internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} are taken into account, and can be acutely sensitive to relatively arbitrary choices of observation period, choice of truncation in estimated covariance matrices and so forth ({cite.10.'Lewis_2013}), illustrating the importance of sensitivity studies. Analyses that make a more complete effort to estimate all uncertainties affecting the model–data comparison lead to more trustworthy results, but end up with larger uncertainties ({cite.10.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}).

The {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} chapter in AR4 ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}) concluded that ‘Estimates based on observational constraints indicate that it is very likely that the {Glossary.*Equilibrium_climate_sensitivity equilibrium climate sensitivity} is larger than 1.5°C with a most likely value between 2°C and 3°C’. The following sections discuss evidence since AR4 from several lines of evidence, followed by an overall assessment of ECS based on observed climate changes, and a subset of available new estimates is shown in {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}b.
