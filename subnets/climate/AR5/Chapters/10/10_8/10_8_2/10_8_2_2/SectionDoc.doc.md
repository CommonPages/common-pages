title: 10.8.2.2 - Estimates Based on Top of the Atmosphere Radiative Balance

With the satellite era, measurements are now long enough to allow direct estimates of variations in the {Glossary.*Energy_budget_of_the_Earth energy budget} of the planet, although the measurements are not sufficiently accurate to determine absolute top of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} (TOA) fluxes or trends (see {Chapters.2.2_3 Section 2.3} and {Box_13_1 Box 13.1}). Using a simple {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} relationship between net energy flow towards the Earth, net {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} and a climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} parameter and the satellite measurements {cite.10.'Murphy_et_al_2009 Murphy et al. (2009)} made direct estimates of the {Glossary.*Climate_feedback climate feedback} parameter as the regression coefficient of radiative response against {Topics.*Surface_Temperature GMST}. The feedback parameter in turn is inversely proportional to the ECS (see above, also {cite.10.'Forster_and_Gregory_2006}). Such regression based estimates are, however, subject to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_7 Section 7.2.5.7}; see also, {cite.10.'Gregory_and_Forster_2008}; {cite.10.'Murphy_and_Forster_2010}). {cite.10.'Lindzen_and_Choi_2009 Lindzen and Choi (2009)} used data from the radiative budget and simple {Glossary.*Energy_Balance_Model energy balance models} over the tropics to investigate feedbacks in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. Their result suggests that climate models overestimate the outgoing {Glossary.*Shortwave_radiation shortwave radiation} compared to Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data, but this result was found unreliable owing to use of a limited sample of periods and of a domain limited to low latitudes ({cite.10.'Murphy_and_Forster_2010}). {cite.10.'Lindzen_and_Choi_2011 Lindzen and Choi (2011)} address some of these criticisms ({cite.10.'Chung_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Trenberth_et_al_2010}), but the results remains uncertain. For example, the lag-lead relationship between TOA balance and {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} ({cite.10.'Lindzen_and_Choi_2011}) is replicated by Atmospheric {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project (AMIP) simulations where SST cannot respond ({cite.10.'Dessler_2011}). Hence, as discussed in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_7 Section 7.2.5.7}, the influence of internal temperature variations on short time scales seriously affects such estimates of feedbacks. In addition, the energy budget changes that are used to derive feedbacks are also affected by RF, which {cite.10.'Lindzen_and_Choi_2009 Lindzen and Choi (2009)} do not account for. {cite.10.'Murphy_and_Forster_2010 Murphy and Forster (2010)} further question if estimates of the feedback parameter are suitable to estimate the ECS, as multiple time scales are involved in feedbacks that contribute to {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} ({cite.10.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}; {cite.10.'Dessler_2010}). {cite.10.'Lin_et_al_2010a Lin et al. (2010a)} use data over the 20th century combined with an estimate of present TOA imbalance based on modelling ({cite.10.'Hansen_et_al_2005a}) to estimate the energy budget of the planet and give a best estimate of ECS of 3.1Â°C, but do not attempt to estimate a distribution that accounts fully for uncertainties. In conclusion, measurement and methodological uncertainties in estimates of the feedback parameter and the ECS from short-term variations in the satellite period preclude strong constraints on ECS. When accounting for these uncertainties, estimates of ECS based on the TOA {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget} appear consistent with those from other lines of evidence within large uncertainties (e.g., {cite.10.'Forster_and_Gregory_2006}; {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}b).
