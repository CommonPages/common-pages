title: 10.8.2.3 - Estimates Based on Response to Volcanic Forcing or Internal Variability

Some analyses used in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} were based on the well observed {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} and responses to major volcanic eruptions during the 20th century. The constraint is fairly weak because the peak response to short-term volcanic forcing depends nonlinearly on ECS ({cite.10.'Wigley_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Boer_et_al_2007}). Recently, {cite.10.'Bender_et_al_2010 Bender et al. (2010)} re-evaluated the constraint and found a close relationship in 9 out of 10 AR4 models between the shortwave TOA imbalance, the simulated response to the eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the ECS. Applying the constraint from observations suggests a range of ECS of 1.7°C to 4.1°C. This range for ECS is subject to observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} and uncertainty due to internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, and is derived from a limited sample of models. {cite.10.'Schwartz_2007 Schwartz (2007)} tried to relate the ECS to the strength of natural variability using the fluctuation dissipation theorem but studies suggest that the observations are too short to support a well constrained and reliable estimate and would yield an underestimate of sensitivity (Kirk-Davidoff, 2009); and that assuming single time scales is too simplistic for the climate system ({cite.10.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}) . Thus, credible estimates of ECS from the response to natural and internal variability do not disagree with other estimates, but at present cannot provide more reliable estimates of ECS.
