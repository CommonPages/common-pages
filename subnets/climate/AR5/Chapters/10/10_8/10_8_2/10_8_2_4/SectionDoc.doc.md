title: 10.8.2.4 - Paleoclimatic Evidence

Palaeoclimatic evidence is promising for estimating ECS ({cite.10.'Edwards_et_al_2007}). This section reports on probabilistic estimates of ECS derived from paleoclimatic data by drawing on {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} information on forcing and temperature changes. For periods of {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate}, which were close to radiative balance or when climate was changing slowly, for example, the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}, radiative imbalance and with it ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} is less important than for the present (Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_1 5.3.3.1} and {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 5.3.3.2}). Treating the RF due to ice sheets, dust and {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} as {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} rather than feedbacks implies that the corresponding RF contributions are associated with considerable {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_3 Section 5.2.2.3}). {cite.10.'Koehler_et_al_2010 Koehler et al. (2010)} used an estimate of LGM cooling along with its uncertainties together with estimates of LGM RF and its uncertainty to derive an overall estimate of {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity}. This method accounts for the effect of changes in feedbacks for this very different climatic state using published estimates of changes in {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} factors (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 Section 5.3.3.2}; {cite.10.'Hargreaves_et_al_2007}; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2009). The authors find a best estimate of 2.4°C and a 5 to 95% range of ECS from 1.4°C to 5.2°C, with sensitivities beyond 6°C difficult to reconcile with the data. In contrast, {cite.10.'Chylek_and_Lohmann_2008b Chylek and Lohmann (2008b)} estimate the ECS to be 1.3°C to 2.3°C based on data for the transition from the LGM to the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene}. However, the true uncertainties are likely larger due to uncertainties in relating local proxies to large-scale temperature change observed over a limited time (Ganopolski and von Deimling, 2008; {cite.10.'Hargreaves_and_Annan_2009}). The authors also use an {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} RF estimate that may be high (see response by {cite.10.'Chylek_and_Lohmann_2008a}; Ganopolski and von Deimling, 2008).

At the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, several studies were assessed in which parameters in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} had been perturbed systematically in order to estimate ECS, and further studies have been published since, some making use of expanded data for LGM climate change (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 Section 5.3.3.2}, {'Table_5_3 Table 5.3}). Sometimes substantial differences between estimates based on similar data reflect not only differences in assumptions on forcing and use of data, but also structural model uncertainties, for example, in how feedbacks change between different climatic states (e.g., Schneider von Deimling et al., 2006; {cite.10.'Hargreaves_et_al_2007}; (see also Otto-Bliesner et al., 2009). {cite.10.'Holden_et_al_2010 Holden et al. (2010)} analysed which versions of the {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMIC} Genie are consistent with LGM tropical SSTs and find a 90% range of 2.0°C to 5.0°C. Recently, new data synthesis products have become available for assessment with climate model simulations of the LGM which together with further data cover much more of the LGM ocean and land areas, although there are still substantial gaps and substantial data uncertainty ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3 Section 5.3.3}). An analysis of the recent {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} and land temperature reconstructions for the LGM compared to simulations with an EMIC suggests a 90% range of 1.4°C to 2.8°C for ECS, with SST data providing a narrower range and lower values than land data only (see {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}; {cite.10.'Schmittner_et_al_2011}). However, structural model uncertainty as well as data uncertainty may increase this range substantially ({cite.10.'Fyke_and_Eby_2012}; {cite.10.'Schmittner_et_al_2012}). {cite.10.'Hargreaves_et_al_2012 Hargreaves et al. (2012)} derived a relationship between ECS and LGM response for seven model simulations from PMIP2 simulations and found a linear relationship between tropical cooling and ECS (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 Section 5.3.3.2}) which has been used to derive an estimate of ECS ({'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}); and has been updated using PMIP3 simulations ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 Section 5.3.3.2}). However, uncertainties remain as the relationship is dependent on the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of models used.

Estimates of ECS from other, more distant {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} periods (e.g., {cite.10.'Royer_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Royer_2008}; {cite.10.'Pagani_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Lunt_et_al_2010}) are difficult to directly compare, as climatic conditions were very different from today and as climate sensitivity can be state dependent, as discussed above. Also, the response on very long time scales is determined by the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Sensitivity, which includes very slow feedbacks by ice sheets and vegetation (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}). Paleosens Members (2012) reanalysed the relationship between RF and temperature response from paleoclimatic studies, considering Earth system feedbacks as forcings in order to derive an estimate of ECS that is limited to atmospheric feecbacks (sometimes referred to as Charney sensitivity and directly comparable to ECS), and find that resulting estimates are reasonably consistent over the past 65 million years (see detailed discussion in {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 Section 5.3.1}). They estimate a 95% range of 1.1°C to 7.0°C, largely based on the past 800,000 years. However, uncertainties in paleoclimate estimates of ECS are likely to be larger than from the instrumental record, for example, due to changes in feedbacks between different climatic states. In conclusion, estimates of ECS have continued to emerge from palaeoclimatic periods that indicate that ECS is very likely less than 6°C and very likely greater than 1.0°C (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3 Section 5.3.3}).
