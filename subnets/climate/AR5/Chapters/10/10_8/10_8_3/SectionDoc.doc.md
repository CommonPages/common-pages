title: 10.8.3 - Consequences for Aerosol Forcing and Ocean Heat Uptake

Some estimates of ECS also yield estimates of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} forcing that are consistent with observational records, which we briefly mention here. Note that the estimate will reflect any {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} with a time or time– space pattern resembling aerosol forcing that is not explicitly included in the overall estimate (see discussion in {cite.10.'Olson_et_al_2012}), for example, {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} on snow; and should hence be interpreted as an estimate of aerosol plus neglected forcings. Estimates will also vary with the method applied and diagnostics used (e.g., analyses including spatial information will yield stronger results). {cite.10.'Murphy_et_al_2009 Murphy et al. (2009)} use correlations between {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} and outgoing shortwave and longwave flux over the satellite period to estimate how much of the total recent forcing has been reduced by aerosol total reflection, which they estimate as –1.1 ± 0.4 W m–2 from 1970 to 2000 (1 standard deviation), while {cite.10.'Libardoni_and_Forest_2011 Libardoni and Forest (2011)}, see also {cite.10.'Forest_et_al_2008 Forest et al. (2008)}, based on the 20th century, find somewhat lower estimates, namely a 90% bound of –0.83 to –0.19 W m–2 for the 1980s relative to preindustrial. {cite.10.'Lewis_2013 Lewis (2013)}, using similar diagnostics but an objective {Glossary.*Bayesian_method_approach Bayesian method}, estimates a total aerosol forcing of about –0.6 to –0.1W m–2 or –0.6 to 0.0 W m–2 dependent on diagnostic used. The range of the aerosol forcing estimates that are based on the observed climate change are in-line with the expert judgement of the effective RF by aerosol radiation and aerosol cloud interactions combined ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci}+ari; {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}) of –0.9 W m–2 with a range from –1.9 to –0.1 W m–2 that has been guided by {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} that include aerosol effects on mixed-phase and convective clouds in addition to liquid clouds, satellite studies and models that allow cloud-scale responses (see {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2 Section 7.5.2}).

Several estimates of ECS also estimate a parameter that describe the efficiency with which the ocean takes up heat, e.g., effective global vertical ocean diffusivity (e.g., {cite.10.'Tomassini_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Forest_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Olson_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Lewis_2013}). {cite.10.'Forest_and_Reynolds_2008 Forest and Reynolds (2008)} find that the effective global ocean diffusivity Kv in many of the CMIP3 models lies above the median value based on observational constraints, resulting in a positive bias in their ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake}. {cite.10.'Lewis_2013 Lewis (2013)} similarly finds better agreement for small values of effective ocean diffusivity. However, such a finding was very sensitive to data sets used for {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} ({cite.10.'Libardoni_and_Forest_2011}) and ocean data ({cite.10.'Sokolov_et_al_2010}), is somewhat sensitive to the diagnostic applied ({cite.10.'Lewis_2013}), and limited by difficulties observing heat uptake in the deep ocean (see, e.g., Chapters {Chapters.3} and {Chapters.13}). {cite.10.'Olson_et_al_2012 Olson et al. (2012)} and {cite.10.'Tomassini_et_al_2007 Tomassini et al. (2007)} find that data over the historical period provide only a weak constraint on background ocean effective diffusivity. Comparison of the vertical profiles of temperature and of historical warming in models and observations suggests that the {Glossary.*Ocean_heat_uptake_efficiency ocean heat uptake efficiency} may be typically too large ({cite.10.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}; {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_1 Section 13.4.1}; see also Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2 9.4.2} {Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_1 10.4.1}, {Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_3 10.4.3}). If effective diffusivity were high in models this might lead to a tendency to bias ocean warming high relative to surface warming; but this {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} makes only a small contribution to uncertainty in TCR ({cite.10.'Knutti_and_Tomassini_2008}; {cite.10.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}; see {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_1 Section 13.4.1}). Nonetheless, ocean {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} and heat content change simulated in CMIP5 models show relatively good agreement with observations, although this might also be due to a compensation between ocean heat uptake efficiency and atmospheric feedbacks ({cite.10.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}). In summary, constraints on effective ocean diffusivity are presently not conclusive.
