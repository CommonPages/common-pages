title: 10.8 - Implications for Climate System Properties and Projections

{Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change Attribution} results can be used to constrain {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} of future climate change (see Chapters {Chapters.11} and {Chapters.12}) and key climate system properties. These properties include: the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), which determines the long-term equilibrium warming response to stable atmospheric composition, but not accounting for vegetation or {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} changes ({Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}; see {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}); the transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} (TCR), which is a measure of the magnitude of transient warming while the climate system, particularly the deep ocean, is not in equilibrium; and the transient climate response to cumulative {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({Glossary.*Transient_climate_response_to_cumulative_CO2_emissions TCRE}), which is a measure of the transient warming response to a given mass of CO2 injected into the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, and combines information on both the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} and climate response. TCR is more tightly constrained by the observations of transient warming than ECS. The observational constraints on TCR, ECS and TCRE assessed here focus on information provided by recent observed climate change, complementing analysis of feedbacks and climate modelling information, which are assessed in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}. The assessment in this chapter also incorporates observational constraints based on palaeoclimatic information, building on {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}, and contributes to the overall synthesis assessment in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12} ({Box_12_2 Box 12.2}).

Because neither ECS nor TCR is directly observed, any inference about them requires some form of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model}, ranging in complexity from a simple zero-dimensional {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} box model to OAGCMs ({cite.10.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011}). Constraints on estimates of long-term climate change and equilibrium climate change from recent warming hinge on the rate at which the ocean has taken up heat ({Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}), and by the extent to which recent warming has been reduced by cooling from {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. Therefore, attempts to estimate {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (transient or equilibrium) often also estimate the total aerosol forcing and the rate of ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake}, which are discussed in {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_3 Section 10.8.3}. The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} contained a detailed discussion on estimating quantities relevant for {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, and included an appendix with the relevant estimation methods. Here, we build on this assessment, repeating information and discussion only where necessary to provide context.
