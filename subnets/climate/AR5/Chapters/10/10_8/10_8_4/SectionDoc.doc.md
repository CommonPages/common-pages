title: 10.8.4 - Earth System Properties

A number of papers have found the global warming response to {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} emissions to be determined primarily by total cumulative emissions of CO2, irrespective of the timing of those emissions over a broad range of {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Matthews_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Zickfeld_et_al_2009}; {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_4.12_5_4_2 Section 12.5.4.2}), although {cite.10.'Bowerman_et_al_2011 Bowerman et al. (2011)} find that, when scenarios with persistent ‘emission floors’ are included, the strongest predictor of peak warming is cumulative emissions to 2200. Moreover, the ratio of global warming to cumulative carbon emissions, known variously as the Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential (AGTP; defined for an infinitesimal pulse emission) ({cite.10.'Shine_et_al_2005}), the Cumulative Warming Commitment (defined based on peak warming in response to a finite injection; CWC) ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2009}) or the Carbon Climate Response (CCR) ({cite.10.'Matthews_et_al_2009}), is approximately scenario-independent and constant in time.

The ratio of CO2-induced warming realized by a given year to cumulative carbon emissions to that year is known as the Transient Climate Response to cumulative CO2 {Topics.*Emissions Emissions} ({Glossary.*Transient_climate_response_to_cumulative_CO2_emissions TCRE}, see {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}). TCRE depends on TCR and the Cumulative Airborne Fraction (CAF), which is the ratio of the increased mass of CO2 in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} to cumulative CO2 emissions (not including natural fluxes and those arising from {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} feedbacks) over a long period, typically since pre-industrial times ({cite.10.'Gregory_et_al_2009}): TCRE = TCR × CAF/C0, where C0 is the mass of carbon (in the form of CO2) in the pre-industrial atmosphere (590 PgC). Given estimates of CAF to the time of CO2 doubling of 0.4 to 0.7 ({cite.10.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}), we therefore expect values of TCRE, if expressed in units of °C per 1000 PgC, to be similar to or slightly lower than, and more uncertain than, values of TCR (Gillett et al., 2013 ).

TCRE may be estimated from observations by dividing an estimate of warming to date attributable to CO2 by historical cumulative carbon emissions, which gives a 5 to 95% range of 0.7°C to 2.0°C per 1000 PgC (Gillett et al., 2013 ), 1.0°C to 2.1°C per 1000 PgC ({cite.10.'Matthews_et_al_2009}) or 1.4°C to 2.5°C per 1000 PgC ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2009}), the higher range in the latter study reflecting a higher estimate of CO2-attributable warming to 2000. The peak warming induced by a given total cumulative carbon emission (Peak Response to Cumulative Emissions (PRCE)) is less well constrained, since warming may continue even after a complete cessation of CO2 emissions, particularly in high-response models or scenarios. Using a combination of observations and models to constrain temperature and {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} parameters in a simple climate-carbon-cycle model, ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2009}), obtain a PRCE 5 to 95% confidence interval of 1.3°C to 3.9°C per 1000 PgC. They also report that ({cite.10.'Meinshausen_et_al_2009}) obtain a 5 to 95% range in PRCE of 1.1°C to 2.7°C per 1000 PgC using a {Glossary.*Bayesian_method_approach Bayesian approach} with a different simple model, with climate parameters constrained by observed warming and carbon cycle parameters constrained by the C4MIP simulations ({cite.10.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006}).

The ratio of warming to cumulative emissions, the TCRE, is assessed to be likely between 0.8°C and 2.5oC per 1000 PgC based on observational constraints. This implies that, for warming due to CO2 emissions alone to be likely less than 2°C at the time CO2 emissions cease, total cumulative emissions from all {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} sources over the entire industrial era would need to be limited to about 1000 PgC, or one trillion tonnes of carbon (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_4 Section 12.5.4}).
