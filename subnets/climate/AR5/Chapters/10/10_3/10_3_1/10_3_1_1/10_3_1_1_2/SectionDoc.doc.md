title: 10.3.1.1.2 - Simulations of surface temperature change

As discussed in {Chapters.10.10_1 Section 10.1}, the CMIP5 simulations have several advantages compared to the CMIP3 simulations assessed by ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}) for the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of climate change. {'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}a shows that when the effects of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} are included in the CMIP5 simulations the spread of simulated GMST anomalies spans the observational estimates of GMST anomaly in almost every year whereas this is not the case for simulations in which only natural forcings are included ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}b) (see also Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). Anomalies are shown relative to 1880–1919 rather than absolute temperatures. Showing anomalies is necessary to prevent changes in observational coverage being reflected in the calculated global mean and is reasonable because {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} is not a strong function of the bias in GMST in the CMIP5 models ({Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_1 Section 9.7.1}; {'Figure_9_42 Figure 9.42}). Simulations with GHG changes only, and no changes in aerosols or other forcings, tend to simulate more warming than observed ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}c), as expected. Better agreement between models and observations when the models include anthropogenic forcings is also seen in the CMIP3 simulations ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}, thin blue lines). RF in the simulations including anthropogenic and natural forcings differs considerably among models ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}d), and forcing differences explain much of the differences in temperature response between models over the historical period (Forster et al., 2013 ). Differences between observed GMST based on three observational data sets are small compared to forced changes ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}).

As discussed in {Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}, detection and attribution assessments are more robust if they consider more than simple consistency arguments. Analyses that allow for the possibility that models might be consistently overor underestimating the magnitude of the response to climate forcings are assessed in {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_3 Section 10.3.1.1.3}, the conclusions from which are not affected by evidence that {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in GMST in CMIP3, is smaller than implied by the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in RF ({cite.10.'Schwartz_et_al_2007}). Although there is evidence that CMIP3 models with a higher climate sensitivity tend to have a smaller increase in RF over the historical period ({cite.10.'Kiehl_2007}; {cite.10.'Knutti_2008}; {cite.10.'Huybers_2010}), no such relationship was found in CMIP5 (Forster et al., 2013 ) which may explain the wider spread of the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} compared to the CMIP3 ensemble ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}a). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate model} parameters are typically chosen primarily to reproduce features of the mean climate and variability ({Box_9_1 Box 9.1}), and CMIP5 {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} are standardized across models and based on historical emissions ({cite.10.'Lamarque_et_al_2010}; {Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_2 Section 8.2.2}), rather than being chosen by each modelling group independently ({cite.10.'Curry_and_Webster_2011}; Hegerl et al., 2011c).

{'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}a shows the pattern of annual mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} trends observed over the period 1901–2010, based on Hadley Centre/ Climatic Research Unit gridded {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} data set 4 (HadCRUT4). Warming has been observed at almost all locations with sufficient observations available since 1901. Rates of warming are generally higher over land areas compared to oceans, as is also apparent over the 1951–2010 period ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}c), which simulations indicate is due mainly to differences in local feedbacks and a net anomalous heat transport from oceans to land under GHG forcing, rather than differences in thermal inertia (e.g., {cite.10.'Boer_2011}). {'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}e demonstrates that a similar pattern of warming is simulated in the CMIP5 simulations with natural and anthropogenic forcing over the 1901–2010 period. Over most regions, observed trends fall between the 5th and 95th {Glossary.*Percentiles percentiles} of simulated trends, and van Oldenborgh et al. (2013) find that over the 1950–2011 period the pattern of observed grid cell trends agrees with CMIP5 simulated trends to within a combination of model spread and {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}. Areas of disagreement over the 1901–2010 period include parts of Asia and the Southern Hemisphere (SH) mid-latitudes, where the simulations warm less than the observations, and parts of the tropical Pacific, where the simulations warm more than the observations (Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). Stronger warming in observations than models over parts of East Asia could in part be explained by uncorrected urbanization influence in the observations ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_1.2_4_1_3 Section 2.4.1.3}), or by an overestimate of the response to aerosol increases. Trends simulated in response to natural forcings only are generally close to zero, and inconsistent with observed trends in most locations ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}i) (see also {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). Trends simulated in response to GHG changes only over the 1901–2010 period are larger than those observed at most locations, and in many cases significantly so ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}m). This is expected because these simulations do not include the cooling effects of aerosols. Differences in patterns of simulated and observed seasonal mean temperature trends and possible causes are considered in more detail in {Box_11_2 Box 11.2}.

Over the period 1979–2010 most observed regions exhibited warming ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}d), but much of the eastern Pacific and Southern Oceans cooled. These regions of cooling are not seen in the simulated trends over this period in response to anthropogenic and natural forcing ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}h), which show significantly more warming in much of these regions (Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). This cooling and reduced warming in observations over the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes over the 1979–2010 period can also be seen in the zonal mean trends ({'Figure_10_3 Figure 10.3}d), which also shows that the models tend to warm too much in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} over this period. However, there is no discrepancy in zonal mean temperature trends over the longer 1901–2010 period in this region ({'Figure_10_3 Figure 10.3}a), suggesting that the discrepancy over the 1979–2010 period either may be an unusually strong manifestation of internal variability in the observations or relate to regionally important forcings over the past three decades which are not included in most CMIP5 simulations, such as sea salt aerosol increases due to strengthened high latitude winds ({cite.10.'Korhonen_et_al_2010}), or {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} extent increases driven by freshwater input from {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} melting ({cite.10.'Bintanja_et_al_2013}). Except at high latitudes, zonal mean trends over the 1901–2010 period in all three data sets are inconsistent with naturally forced trends, indicating a detectable anthropogenic signal in most zonal means over this period ({'Figure_10_3 Figure 10.3}a). {cite.10.'McKitrick_and_Tole_2012 McKitrick and Tole (2012)} find that few CMIP3 models have significant explanatory power when fitting the spatial pattern of 1979–2002 trends in surface temperature over land, by which they mean that these models add little or no skill to a fit including the spatial pattern of tropospheric temperature trends as well as the major atmospheric oscillations. This is to be expected, as temperatures in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} are well correlated in the vertical, and local temperature trends over so short a period are dominated by internal variability.

CMIP5 models generally exhibit realistic variability in GMST on decadal to multi-decadal time scales (Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}; {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_1 Section 9.5.3.1}, {'Figure_9_33 Figure 9.33}), although it is difficult to evaluate internal variability on multi-decadal time scales in observations given the shortness of the observational record and the presence of {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing}. The observed {Glossary.*Trend trend} in GMST since the 1950s is very large compared to model estimates of internal variability ({cite.10.'Stott_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Drost_et_al_2012}; Drost and Karoly, 2012). {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013 Knutson et al. (2013)} compare observed trends in GMST with a combination of simulated internal variability and the response to natural forcings and find that the observed trend would still be detected for trends over this period even if the magnitude of the simulated natural variability (i.e., the standard deviation of trends) were tripled.
