title: 10.3.1.1.3 - Attribution of observed global-scale temperature changes

The evolution of temperature since the start of the global instrumental record

Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, detection and attribution studies have been carried out using new model simulations with more realistic forcings, and new observational data sets with improved representation of uncertainty ({cite.10.'Christidis_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Jones_et_al_2011}, 2013; {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2012}, 2013; {cite.10.'Stott_and_Jones_2012}; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). Although some inconsistencies between the simulated and observed responses to forcings in individual models were identified ( Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}) overall these results support the AR4 assessment that GHG increases very likely caused most (>50%) of the observed GMST increase since the mid-20th century ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}).

The results of multiple regression analyses of observed temperature changes onto the simulated responses to GHG, other {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural forcings are shown in {'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4} (Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). The results, based on HadCRUT4 and a multi-model average, show robustly detected responses to GHG in the observational record whether data from 1861–2010 or only from 1951–2010 are analysed ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}b). The advantage of analysing the longer period is that more information on observed and modelled changes is included, while a disadvantage is that it is difficult to validate {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}’ estimates of internal variability over such a long period. Individual model results exhibit considerable spread among scaling factors, with estimates of warming attributable to each forcing sensitive to the model used for the analsys ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}; Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}), the period over which the analysis is applied ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}; Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013), and the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) truncation or degree of spatial filtering (Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). In some cases the GHG response is not detectable in regressions using individual models ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}; Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}), or a residual test is failed (Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}), indicating a poor fit between the simulated response and observed changes. Such cases are probably due largely to errors in the spatio-temporal pattern of responses to forcings simulated in individual models ({cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}), although observational error and internal variability errors could also play a role. Nonetheless, analyses in which responses are averaged across multiple models generally show much less sensitivity to period and EOF trucation (Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013), and more consistent residuals (Gillett et al., 2013), which may be because model response errors are smaller in a multi-model mean.

{image:'Figure_10_4}

We derive assessed ranges for the attributable contributions of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, other anthropogenic forcings and natural forcings by taking the smallest ranges with a precision of one decimal place that span the 5 to 95% ranges of attributable trends over the 1951–2010 period from the Jones et al. (2013) weighted multi-model analysis and the Gillett et al. (2013) multi-model analysis considering observational uncertainty ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}a). The assessed range for the attributable contribution of combined anthropogenic forcings was derived in the same way from the Gillett et al. (2013) multi-model attributable {Glossary.*Trend trend} and shown in {'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}c. We moderate our {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} assessment and report likely ranges rather than the very likely ranges directly implied by these studies in order to account for residual sources of uncertainty including sensitivity to EOF truncation and analysis period (e.g., {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). In this context, GHGs means well-mixed greenhouse gases ({Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}), other anthropogenic forcings means {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} changes, and in most models {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} changes and land use changes, and natural forcings means solar irradiance changes and volcanic aerosols. Over the 1951–2010 period, the observed GMST increased by approximately 0.6°C. GHG increases likely contributed 0.5°C to 1.3°C, other anthropogenic forcings likely contributed –0.6°C to 0.1°C and natural forcings likely contributed –0.1°C to 0.1°C to observed GMST trends over this period. Internal variability likely contributed –0.1°C to 0.1°C to observed trends over this period ({cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). This assessment is shown schematically in {'Figure_10_5 Figure 10.5}. The assessment is supported additionally by a complementary analysis in which the parameters of an {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Model of Intermediate Complexity ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMIC}) were constrained using observations of near-{Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} and ocean heat content, as well as prior information on the magnitudes of forcings, and which concluded that GHGs have caused 0.6°C to 1.1°C (5 to 95% uncertainty) warming since the mid-20th century ({cite.10.'Huber_and_Knutti_2011}); an analysis by {cite.10.'Wigley_and_Santer_2013 Wigley and Santer (2013)}, who used an {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} model and RF and {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} estimates from AR4, and they concluded that there was about a 93% chance that GHGs caused a warming greater than observed over the 1950–2005 period; and earlier detection and attribution studies assessed in the AR4 ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}).

{image:'Figure_10_5}

The inclusion of additional data to 2010 (AR4 analyses stopped at 1999; {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b Hegerl et al. (2007b)}) helps to better constrain the magnitude of the GHG-attributable warming ({cite.10.'Drost_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Stott_and_Jones_2012}; Gillett et al., 2013), as does the inclusion of spatial information ({cite.10.'Stott_et_al_2006}; Gillett et al., 2013), though {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013 Ribes and Terray (2013)} caution that in some cases there are inconsistencies between observed spatial patterns of response and those simulated in indvidual models. While {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b Hegerl et al. (2007b)} assessed that a significant cooling of about 0.2 °C was attributable to natural forcings over the 1950–1999 period, the temperature trend attributable to natural forcings over the 1951–2010 period is very small (<0.1°C). This is because, while Mt Pinatubo cooled global temperatures in the early 1990s, there have been no large volcanic eruptions since, resulting in small simulated trends in response to natural forcings over the 1951–2010 period ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}b). Regression coefficients for natural forcings tend to be smaller than one, suggesting that the response to natural forcings may be overestimated by the CMIP5 models on average ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}; Gillett et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). Attribution of observed changes is robust to observational uncertainty which is comparably important to internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} as a {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in

GHG-attributable warming and aerosol-attributable cooling ({cite.10.'Jones_and_Stott_2011}; Gillett et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013}). The response to GHGs was detected using Hadley Centre new Global Environmental Model 2-Earth System (HadGEM2-ES; {cite.10.'Stott_and_Jones_2012}), Canadian {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model Earth System Model} 2 (CanESM2; {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2012}) and other CMIP5 models except for Goddard Institute for Space Studies-E2-H (GISSE2-H; Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013) ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}). However, the influence of other anthropogenic forcings was detected only in some CMIP5 models ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}). This lack of detection of other anthropogenic forcings compared to detection of an aerosol response using four CMIP3 models over the period 1900–1999 ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}) does not only relate to the use of data to 2010 rather than 2000 ({cite.10.'Stott_and_Jones_2012}), although this could play a role (Gillett et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). Whether it is associated with a cancellation of aerosol cooling by ozone and black carbon ({Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}) warming in the CMIP5 simulations, making the signal harder to detect, or by some aspect of the response to other anthropogenic forcings that is less realistic in these models is not clear.

Although closely constraining the GHG and other anthropogenic contributions to observed warming remains challenging owing to their degeneracy and sensitivity to methodological choices (Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}), a total anthropogenic contribution to warming can be much more robustly constrained by a regression of observed temperature changes onto the simulated responses to all anthropogenic forcings and natural forcings ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}; Gillett et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). Robust detection of anthropogenic influence is also found if a new optimal detection methodology, the Regularised Optimal {Glossary.*Fingerprint Fingerprint} approach (see {Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}; {cite.10.'Ribes_et_al_2013}), is applied ({cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}). A better constrained estimate of the total anthropogenic contribution to warming since the mid-20th century than the GHG contribution is also found by {cite.10.'Wigley_and_Santer_2013 Wigley and Santer (2013)}. {cite.10.'Knutson_et_al_2013 Knutson et al. (2013)} demonstrate that observed trends in GMST are inconsistent with the simulated response to natural forcings alone, but consistent with the simulated response to natural and anthropogenic forcings for all periods beginning between 1880 and 1990 and ending in 2010, which they interpret as evidence that warming is in part attributable to anthropogenic influence over these periods. Based on the well-constrained attributable anthropogenic trends shown in {'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4} we assess that anthropogenic forcings likely contributed 0.6°C to 0.8°C to the observed warming over the 1951–2010 period ({'Figure_10_5 Figure 10.5}).

There are some inconsistencies in the simulated and observed magnitudes of responses to forcing for some CMIP5 models ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}); for example, CanESM2 has a GHG regression coefficient significantly less than 1 and a regression coefficient for other anthropogenic forcings also significantly less than 1 ({cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2012}; Gillett et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}), indicating that this model overestimates the magnitude of the response to GHGs and to other anthropogenic forcings. Averaged over the ensembles of models considered by Gillett et al. (2013) and Jones et al. (2013), the best-estimate GHG and OA scaling factors are less than 1 ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}), indicating that the model mean GHG and OA responses should be scaled down to best match observations. The best-estimate GHG scaling factors are larger than the best-estimate OA scaling factors, although the discrepancy from 1 is not significant in either case and the ranges of the GHG and OA scaling factors are overlapping. Overall there is some evidence that some CMIP5 models have a higher transient response to GHGs and a larger response to other anthropogenic forcings (dominated by the effects of aerosols) than the real world (medium confidence). Inconsistencies between simulated and observed trends in GMST were also identified in several CMIP3 models by {cite.10.'Fyfe_et_al_2010 Fyfe et al. (2010)} after removing volcanic, El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}), and Cold Ocean/ Warm Land pattern (COWL) signals from GMST, although {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} may have been underestimated because residuals were modelled by a first-order autoregressive processes. A longer observational record and a better understanding of the temporal changes in forcing should make it easier to identify discrepancies between the magnitude of the observed response to a forcing, and the magnitude of the response simulated in individual models. To the extent that inconsistencies between simulated and observed changes are independent between models, this issue may be addressed by basing our assessment on attribution analyses using the mean response from multiple models, and by accounting for model uncertainty when making such assessments.

In conclusion, although some inconsistencies in the forced responses of individual models and observations have been identified, the detection of the global temperature response to GHG increases using average responses from multiple models is robust to observational uncertainty and methodological choices. It is supported by basic physical arguments. We conclude, consistent with {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b Hegerl et al. (2007b)}, that more than half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010 is very likely due to the observed anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations.

The influence of BC aerosols (from fossil and biofuel sources) has been detected in the recent global temperature record in one analysis, although the warming attributable to BC by {cite.10.'Jones_et_al_2011 Jones et al. (2011)} is small compared to that attributable to GHG increases. This warming is simulated mainly over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) with a sufficiently distinct spatio-temporal pattern that it could be separated from the response to other forcings in this study.

Several recent studies have used techniques other than regression-based detection and attribution analyses to address the causes of recent global temperature changes. Drost and Karoly (2012) demonstrated that observed GMST, land–ocean temperature contrast, meridional temperature gradient and annual cycle amplitude exhibited trends over the period 1956–2005 that were outside the 5 to 95% range of simulated internal variability in eight CMIP5 models, based on three different observational data sets. They also found that observed trends in GMST and land–ocean temperature contrast were larger than those simulated in any of 36 CMIP5 simulations with natural forcing only. {cite.10.'Drost_et_al_2012 Drost et al. (2012)} found that 1961–2010 trends in GMST and land–ocean temperature contrast were significantly larger than simulated internal variability in eight CMIP3 models. By comparing observed GMST with simple statistical models, {cite.10.'Zorita_et_al_2008 Zorita et al. (2008)} concluded that there is a very low probability that observed clustering of very warm years in the last decade occurred by chance. {cite.10.'Smirnov_and_Mokhov_2009 Smirnov and Mokhov (2009)}, adopting an approach that allowed them to distinguish between conventional Granger causality and a ‘long-term causality’ that focuses on low-frequency changes (see {Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}), found that increasing {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations are the principal determining factor in the rise of GMST over recent decades. {cite.10.'Sedlacek_and_Knutti_2012 Sedlacek and Knutti (2012)} found that the spatial patterns of sea {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} ({Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}) trends from simulations forced with increases in GHGs and other anthropogenic forcings agree well with observations but differ from warming patterns associated with internal variability.

Several studies that have aimed to separate forced surface temperature variations from those associated with internal variability have identified the North Atlantic as a dominant centre of multi-decadal internal variability, and in particular modes of variability related to the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}; {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_6 Section 14.7.6}). The AMO index is defined as an area average of North Atlantic SSTs, and it has an apparent period of around 70 years, which is long compared to the length of observational record making it difficult to deduce robust conclusions about the role of the AMO from only two cycles. Nevertheless, several studies claim a role for internal variability associated with the AMO in driving enhanced warming in the 1980s and 1990s as well as the recent slow down in warming ({Box_9_2 Box 9.2}), while attributing long-term warming to anthropogenically forced variations either by analysing time series of GMST, forcings and indices of the AMO ({cite.10.'Rohde_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Tung_and_Zhou_2013}; {cite.10.'Zhou_and_Tung_2013a}) or by analysing both spatial and temporal patterns of temperature ({cite.10.'Swanson_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'DelSole_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Wu_et_al_2011}). Studies based on global mean time series could risk falsely attributing variability to the AMO when variations in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}, for example, associated with aerosols, could also cause similar variability. In contrast, studies using space–time patterns seek to distinguish the spatial structure of temperature anomalies associated with the AMO from those associated with forced variability. Unforced climate simulations indicate that internal multi-decadal variability in the Atlantic is characterized by surface anomalies of the same sign from the equator to the high latitudes, with maximum amplitudes in subpolar regions ({cite.10.'Delworth_and_Mann_2000}; {cite.10.'Latif_et_al_2004}; {cite.10.'Knight_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'DelSole_et_al_2011}) while the net response to anthropogenic and natural forcing over the 20th century, such as observed temperature change, is characterized by warming nearly everywhere on the globe, but with minimum warming or even cooling in the subpolar regions of the North Atlantic ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}; {cite.10.'Ting_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'DelSole_et_al_2011}).

Some studies implicate tropospheric aerosols in driving decadal variations in Atlantic SST ({cite.10.'Evan_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Booth_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Terray_2012}), and temperature variations in eastern North America ({cite.10.'Leibensperger_et_al_2012}). {cite.10.'Booth_et_al_2012 Booth et al. (2012)} find that most multi-decadal variability in North Atlantic SSTs is simulated in one model mainly in response to aerosol variations, although its simulated changes in North Atlantic ocean heat content and salinity have been shown to be inconsistent with observations ({cite.10.'Zhang_et_al_2012}). To the extent that climate models simulate realistic internal variability in the AMO ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_3.9_5_3_3_2 Section 9.5.3.3.2}), AMO variability is accounted for in uncertainty estimates from regression-based detection and attribution studies (e.g., {'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}).

To summarize, recent studies using spatial features of observed temperature variations to separate AMO variability from externally forced changes find that detection of external influence on global temperatures is not compromised by accounting for AMO-congruent variability (high confidence). There remains some uncertainty about how much decadal variability of GMST that is {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to AMO in some studies is actually related to forcing, notably from aerosols. There is agreement among studies that the contribution of the AMO to global warming since 1951 is very small (considerably less than 0.1°C; see also {'Figure_10_6 Figure 10.6}) and given that observed warming since 1951 is very large compared to climate model estimates of internal variability ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_2 Section 10.3.1.1.2}), which are assessed to be adequate at global scale ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_1 Section 9.5.3.1}), we conclude that it is virtually certain that internal variability alone cannot account for the observed global warming since 1951.

{image:'Figure_10_6}

Based on a range of detection and attribution analyses using multiple solar irradiance reconstructions and models, {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b Hegerl et al. (2007b)} concluded that it is very likely that GHGs caused more global warming than solar irradiance variations over the 1950–1999 period. {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} and attribution analyses applied to the CMIP5 simulations ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}) indicate less than 0.1°C temperature change attributable to combined solar and volcanic forcing over the 1951–2010 period. Based on a regression of paleo temperatures onto the response to solar forcing simulated by an energy balance model, {cite.10.'Scafetta_and_West_2007 Scafetta and West (2007)} find that up to 50% of the warming since 1900 may be solar-induced, but {cite.10.'Benestad_and_Schmidt_2009 Benestad and Schmidt (2009)} show this conclusion is not robust, being based on disregarding forcings other than solar in the preindustrial period, and assuming a high and precisely known value for climate sensitivity. Despite claims that more than half the warming since 1970 can be ascribed to solar variability ({cite.10.'Loehle_and_Scaffetta_2011}) , a conclusion based on an incorrect assumption of no anthropogenic influence before 1950 and a 60-year {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} influence on global temperature (see also {cite.10.'Mazzarella_and_Scafetta_2012}), several studies show that solar variations cannot explain global mean surface warming over the past 25 years, because solar irradiance has declined over this period (Lockwood and Fröhlich, 2007, 2008; {cite.10.'Lockwood_2008}, 2012 ). {cite.10.'Lean_and_Rind_2008 Lean and Rind (2008)} conclude that solar forcing explains only 10% of the warming over the past 100 years, while contributing a small cooling over the past 25 years. Thus while there is some evidence for solar influences on {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} variability ({Box_10_2 Box 10.2}) solar forcing has only had a small effect on GMST. Overall, we conclude that it is extremely unlikely that the contribution from solar forcing to the warming since 1950 was larger than that from GHGs.

A range of studies have used statistical methods to separate out the influence of known sources of internal variability, including ENSO and, in some cases, the AMO, from the response to external drivers, including volcanoes, solar variability and anthropogenic influence, in the recent GMST record: see, for example, {cite.10.'Lockwood_2008 Lockwood (2008)}, {cite.10.'Lean_and_Rind_2009 Lean and Rind (2009)}, Folland et al. (2013 ), {cite.10.'Foster_and_Rahmstorf_2011 Foster and Rahmstorf (2011)} and {cite.10.'Kaufmann_et_al_2011 Kaufmann et al. (2011)}. Representative results, as summarized in {cite.10.'Imbers_et_al_2013 Imbers et al. (2013)}, are shown in {'Figure_10_6 Figure 10.6}. These consistently attribute most of the warming over the past 50 years to anthropogenic influence, even allowing for potential confounding factors like the AMO. While results of such statistical approaches are sensitive to assumptions regarding the properties of both responses to external drivers and internal variability ({cite.10.'Imbers_et_al_2013}), they provide a complementary approach to attribution studies based on global climate models.

Overall, given that the anthropogenic increase in GHGs likely caused 0.5°C to 1.3°C warming over 1951–2010, with other anthropogenic forcings probably contributing counteracting cooling, that the effects of natural forcings and natural internal variability are estimated to be small, and that well-constrained and robust estimates of net anthropogenic warming are substantially more than half the observed warming ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}) we conclude that it is extremely likely that {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities} caused more than half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010.

The early 20th century warming

The instrumental GMST record shows a pronounced warming during the first half of the 20th century ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}a). Correction of residual biases in SST observations leads to a higher estimate of 1950s temperatures, but does not substantially change the warming between 1900 and 1940 ({cite.10.'Morice_et_al_2012}). The AR4 concluded that ‘the early 20th century warming is very likely in part due to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing}’ ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}), and that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing contributed to this warming. This assessment was based on studies including {cite.10.'Shiogama_et_al_2006 Shiogama et al. (2006)} who find a contribution from solar and volcanic forcing to observed warming to 1949, and {cite.10.'Min_and_Hense_2006 Min and Hense (2006)}, who find strong evidence for a forced (either natural or combined natural and anthropogenic) contribution to global warming from 1900 to 1949. {cite.10.'Ring_et_al_2012 Ring et al. (2012)} estimate, based on time series analysis, that part of the early 20th century warming was due to GHG increases (see also {'Figure_10_6 Figure 10.6}), but find a dominant contribution by internal variability. CMIP5 model simulations of the historical period show forced warming over the early 20th century ({'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}a), consistent with earlier detection and attribution analyses highlighted in the AR4 and {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR}. The early 20th century contributes to the detection of external forcings over the 20th century estimated by detection and attribution results ({'Figure_10_4 Figure 10.4}; Gillett et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Ribes_and_Terray_2013}) and to the detected change over the last millennium to 1950 (see {'Figure_10_19 Figure 10.19}; {cite.10.'Schurer_et_al_2013}).

{image:'Figure_10_19}

The pattern of warming and residual differences between models and observations indicate a role for circulation changes as a contributor to early 20th cenury warming ({'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}), and the contribution of internal variability to the early 20th century warming has been analysed in several publications since the AR4. {cite.10.'Crook_and_Forster_2011 Crook and Forster (2011)} find that the observed 1918–1940 warming was significantly greater than that simulated by most of the CMIP3 models. A distinguishing feature of the early 20th century warming is its pattern (Brönnimann, 2009) which shows the most pronounced warming in the Arctic during the cold season, followed by North America during the warm season, the North Atlantic Ocean and the tropics. In contrast, there was no unusual warming in Australia among other regions (see {'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}b). Such a pronounced pattern points to a role for circulation change as a contributing factor to the regional anomalies contributing to this warming. Some studies have suggested that the warming is a response to the AMO ({cite.10.'Schlesinger_and_Ramankutty_1994}; {cite.10.'Polyakov_et_al_2005}; {cite.10.'Knight_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Tung_and_Zhou_2013}), or a large but random expression of internal variability ({cite.10.'Bengtsson_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Wood_and_Overland_2010}). {cite.10.'Knight_et_al_2009 Knight et al. (2009)} diagnose a shift from the negative to the positive phase of the AMO from 1910 to 1940, a mode of circulation that is estimated to contribute approximately 0.1°C, trough to peak, to GMST ({cite.10.'Knight_et_al_2005}). Nonetheless, these studies do not challenge the AR4 assessment that external forcing very likely made a contribution to the warming over this period. In conclusion, the early 20th century warming is very unlikely to be due to internal variability alone. It remains difficult to quantify the contribution to this warming from internal variability, natural forcing and anthropogenic forcing, due to forcing and response uncertainties and incomplete observational coverage.

Year-to-year and decade-to-decade variability of {Glossary.*Global_mean_surface_temperature global mean surface temperature}

Time series analyses, such as those shown in {'Figure_10_6 Figure 10.6}, seek to partition the variability of GMST into components attributable to anthropogenic and natural forcings and modes of internal variability such as ENSO and the AMO. Although such time series analyses support the major role of anthropogenic forcings, particularly due to increasing GHG concentrations, in contributing to the overall warming over the last 60 years, many factors, in addition to GHGs, including changes in tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols, stratospheric water vapour and solar output, as well as internal modes of variability, contribute to the year-to-year and decade-to-decade variability of GMST ({'Figure_10_6 Figure 10.6}). Detailed discussion of the evolution of GMST of the past 15 years since 1998 is contained in {Box_9_2 Box 9.2}.
