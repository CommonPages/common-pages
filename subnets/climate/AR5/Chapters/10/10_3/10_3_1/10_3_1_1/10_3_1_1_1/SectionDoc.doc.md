title: 10.3.1.1.1 - Observations of surface temperature change

GMST warmed strongly over the period 1900â€“1940, followed by a period with little {Glossary.*Trend trend}, and strong warming since the mid-1970s ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_3 Section 2.4.3}, {'Figure_10_1 Figure 10.1}). Almost all observed locations have warmed since 1901 whereas over the satellite period since 1979 most regions have warmed while a few regions have cooled ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_3 Section 2.4.3}; {'Figure_10_2 Figure 10.2}). Although this picture is supported by all available global near-{Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} data sets, there are some differences in detail between them, but these are much smaller than both interannual variability and the long-term trend ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_3 Section 2.4.3}). Since 1998 the trend in GMST has been small (see {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_3 Section 2.4.3}, {Box_9_2 Box 9.2}). Urbanization is unlikely to have caused more than 10% of the measured centennial trend in land mean {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature}, though it may have contributed substantially more to regional mean surface temperature trends in rapidly developing regions ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_1.2_4_1_3 Section 2.4.1.3}).
