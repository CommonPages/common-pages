title: 10.3.1.2.1 - Tropospheric temperature change

{Chapters.2 Chapter 2} concludes that it is virtually certain that globally the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} has warmed since the mid-twentieth century with only medium (NH extratropics) to low confidence (tropics and SH extratropics) in the rate and vertical structure of these changes. During the satellite era CMIP3 and CMIP5 models tend to warm faster than observations specifically in the tropics ({cite.10.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Fu_et_al_2011}; Po-Chedley and Fu, 2012; {cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2013}); however, because of the large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in observed tropical temperature trends ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}; {cite.10.'Seidel_et_al_2012 Seidel et al. (2012)}; {'Figure_2_26 Figures 2.26} and {'Figure_2_27 Figure 2.27}) there is only low confidence in this assessment ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_4.9_4_1_4_2 Section 9.4.1.4.2}). Outside the tropics, and over the period of the radiosonde record beginning in 1961, the discrepancy between simulated and observed trends is smaller ({cite.10.'Thorne_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Lott_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2013}). Specifically there is better agreement between observed trends and CMIP5 model trends for the NH extratropics ({cite.10.'Lott_et_al_2013}). Factors other than observational uncertainties that contribute to inconsistencies between observed and simulated free troposphere warming include specific manifestation of natural variability in the observed coupled {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean system, forcing errors incorporated in the historical simulations and model response errors ({cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2013}).

Utilizing a subset of CMIP5 models with single forcing experiments extending until 2010, {cite.10.'Lott_et_al_2013 Lott et al. (2013)} detect influences of both human induced GHG increase and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} (e.g., {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and aerosols) in the spatio-temporal changes in tropospheric temperatures from 1961 to 2010 estimated from radiosonde observations. {'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8} illustrates that a subsample of CMIP5 models (see Supplementary Material for model selection) forced with both {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural climate drivers (red profiles) exhibit trends that are consistent with radiosonde records in the troposphere up to about 300 hPa, albeit with a tendency for this subset of models to warm more than the observations. This finding is seen in near-globally averaged data (where there is sufficient observational coverage to make a meaningful comparison: 60°S to 60°N) (right panel), as well as in latitudinal bands of the SH extratropics ({'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8}, first panel), tropics ({'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8}, second panel) and the NH extratropics ({'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8}, third panel). {'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8} also illustrates that it is very unlikely that natural forcings alone could have caused the observed warming of tropospheric temperatures (blue profiles). The ensembles with both anthropogenic and natural forcings (red) and with GHG forcings only (green) are not clearly separated. This could be due to cancellation of the effects of increases in reflecting aerosols, which cool the troposphere, and absorbing {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} ({cite.10.'Penner_et_al_2007}) and tropospheric ozone, which both warm the troposphere. Above 300 hPa the three radiosonde data sets exhibit a larger spread as a result of larger uncertainties in the observational record ({cite.10.'Thorne_et_al_2011}; {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}). In this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of the upper troposphere simulated CMIP5 temperature trends tend to be more positive than observed trends ({'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8}). Further, an assessment of causes of observed trends in the upper troposphere is less confident than an assessment of overall atmospheric temperature changes because of observational uncertainties and potential remaining systematic biases in observational data sets in this region ({cite.10.'Thorne_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Haimberger_et_al_2012}). An analysis of contributions of natural and anthropogenic forcings to more recent trends from 1979 to 2010 (Supplementary Material, Figure S.A.1) is less robust because of increased uncertainty in observed trends (consistent with {cite.10.'Seidel_et_al_2012 Seidel et al. (2012)}) as well as decreased capability to separate between individual forcings ensembles.

One approach to identify a climate change signal in a time series is the analysis of the ratio between the amplitude of the observed signal of change divided by the magnitude of {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}, in other words the S/N ratio of the data record. The S/N ratio represents the result of a non-optimal {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} analysis (in contrast to optimal fingerprint analyses where model-simulated responses and observations are normalized by internal variability to improve the S/N ratio (see {Chapters.10.10_2.10_2_3 Section 10.2.3}). For changes in the lower stratospheric temperature between 1979 and 2011, S/N ratios vary from 26 to 36, depending on the choice of observational data set. In the lower troposphere, the fingerprint strength in observations is smaller, but S/N ratios are still significant at the 1% level or better, and range from 3 to 8. There is no evidence that these ratios are spuriously inflated by model variability errors. After all global mean signals are removed, model fingerprints remain identifiable in 70% of the tests involving tropospheric temperature changes ({cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2013}).

{cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007a Hegerl et al. (2007a)} concluded that increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} are the main cause for warming of the troposphere. This result is supported by a subsample of CMIP5 models that also suggest that the warming effect of well mixed GHGs is partly offset by the combined effects of reflecting aerosols and other forcings. Our understanding has been increased regarding the time scale of detectability of global scale troposphere temperature. Taken together with increased understanding of the uncertainties in observational records of tropospheric temperatures (including residual systematic biases; {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}) the assessment remains as it was for {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing has led to a detectable warming of tropospheric temperatures since 1961.
