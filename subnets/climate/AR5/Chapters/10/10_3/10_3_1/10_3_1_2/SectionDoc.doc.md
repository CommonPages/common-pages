This section presents an assessment of the causes of global and regional temperature changes in the free {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. In {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b Hegerl et al. (2007b)} concluded that ‘the observed pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is very likely due to the influence of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing, particularly greenhouse gases and stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} depletion.’ Since AR4, insight has been gained into regional aspects of free tropospheric trends and the causes of observed changes in stratospheric temperature.

Atmospheric temperature trends through the depth of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} offer the possibility of separating the effects of multiple climate forcings, as {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} simulations indicate that each {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} produces a different characteristic vertical and zonal pattern of temperature response ({cite.10.'Hansen_et_al_2005b}; {cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.10.'Penner_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Yoshimori_and_Broccoli_2008}). GHG forcing is expected to warm the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and cool the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}. Stratospheric ozone depletion cools the stratosphere, with the cooling being most pronounced in the polar regions. Its effect on tropospheric temperatures is small, which is consistent with a small estimated RF of stratospheric ozone changes (SPARC CCMVal, 2010; {cite.10.'McLandress_et_al_2012}). Tropospheric ozone increase, on the other hand, causes tropospheric warming. Reflective aerosols like sulphate cool the troposphere while absorbing aerosols like {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} have a warming effect. {Glossary.*Free_atmosphere Free atmosphere} temperatures are also affected by natural forcings: solar irradiance increases cause a general warming of the atmosphere and volcanic {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} ejected into the stratosphere causes tropospheric cooling and stratospheric warming ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}).
