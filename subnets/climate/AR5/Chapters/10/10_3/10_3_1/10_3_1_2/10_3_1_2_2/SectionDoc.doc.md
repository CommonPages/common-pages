title: 10.3.1.2.2 - Stratospheric temperature change

Lower stratospheric temperatures have not evolved uniformly over the period since 1958 when the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} has been observed with sufficient regularity and spatial coverage. A long-term global cooling {Glossary.*Trend trend} is interrupted by three 2-year warming episodes following large volcanic eruptions ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}). During the satellite period the cooling evolved mainly in two steps occurring in the aftermath of the El Chichón eruption in 1982 and the Mt Pinatubo eruption of 1991, with each cooling transition being followed by a period of relatively steady temperatures ({cite.10.'Randel_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Seidel_et_al_2011}). Since the mid1990s little net change has occurred in lower stratospheric temperatures ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}).

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, progress has been made in simulating the observed evolution of global mean lower stratospheric temperature. On the one hand, this has been achieved by using models with an improved representation of stratospheric processes (chemistry–{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} and some CMIP5 models). It is found that in these models which have an upper boundary above the stratopause with an altitude of about 50 km (so-called high-top models) and improved stratospheric physics, variability of lower stratosphere climate in general is well simulated ({cite.10.'Butchart_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2011}; Charlton-Perez et al., 2013) whereas in so-called low-top models (including models participating in CMIP3) it is generally underestimated ({cite.10.'Cordero_and_Forster_2006}; Charlton-Perez et al., 2013). On the other hand, CMIP5 models all include changes in stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({cite.10.'Eyring_et_al_2013}) whereas only about half of the models participating in CMIP3 include stratospheric ozone changes ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_4.9_4_1_4_5 Section 9.4.1.4.5}). A comparison of a low-top and high-top version of the HadGEM2 model shows detectable differences in modelled temperature changes, particularly in the lower tropical stratosphere, with the high-top version’s simulation of temperature trends in the tropical {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} in better agreement with radiosondes and reanalyses over 1981–2010 ({cite.10.'Mitchell_et_al_2013}).

CMIP5 models forced with changes in {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} and stratospheric ozone as well as with changes in solar irradiance and volcanic {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} forcings simulate the evolution of observed global mean lower stratospheric temperatures over the satellite era reasonably well although they tend to underestimate the long-term cooling trend (Charlton-Perez et al., 2013; {cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2013}). Compared with radiosonde data the cooling trend is also underestimated in a subset of CMIP5 simulations over the period 1961–2010 ({'Figure_10_8 Figure 10.8}) and in CMIP3 models over the 1958–1999 period ({cite.10.'Cordero_and_Forster_2006}). Potential causes for biases in lower stratosphere temperature trends are observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}) and forcing errors related to prescribed stratospheric aerosol loadings and stratospheric ozone changes affecting the tropical lower stratosphere ({cite.10.'Free_and_Lanzante_2009}; {cite.10.'Solomon_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2013}).

Since AR4, {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} have improved our knowledge of the role of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural forcings in observed lower stratospheric temperature change. {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2011 Gillett et al. (2011)} use the suite of chemistry climate model simulations carried out as part of the Chemistry Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) activity phase 2 for an attribution study of observed changes in stratospheric zonal mean temperatures. Chemistry–climate models prescribe changes in ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and ozone changes are calculated interactively. {cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2011 Gillett et al. (2011)} partition 1979–2005 Microwave Sounding Unit ({Glossary.*Microwave_Sounding_Unit MSU}) lower stratospheric temperature trends into ODS-induced and GHG-induced changes and find that both ODSs and natural forcing contributed to the observed stratospheric cooling in the lower stratosphere with the impact of ODS dominating. The influence of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} on stratospheric temperature could not be detected independently of ODSs.

The step-like cooling of the lower stratosphere can only be explained by the combined effects of changes in both anthropogenic and natural factors ({'Figure_10_9 Figure 10.9}; {cite.10.'Eyring_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Ramaswamy_et_al_2006}). Although the anthropogenic factors (ozone depletion and increases in WMGHGs) cause the overall cooling, the natural factors (solar irradiance variations and volcanic aerosols) modulate the evolution of the cooling ({'Figure_10_9 Figure 10.9}; {cite.10.'Ramaswamy_et_al_2006}; Dall’Amico et al., 2010) with temporal variability of global mean ozone contributing to the step-like temperature evolution ({cite.10.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2009}).

Models disagree with observations for seasonally varying changes in the strength of the {Glossary.*Brewer_Dobson_circulation Brewer–Dobson circulation} in the lower stratosphere ({cite.10.'Ray_et_al_2010}) which has been linked to zonal and seasonal patterns of changes in lower stratospheric temperatures ({cite.10.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2009}; {cite.10.'Fu_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Lin_et_al_2010b}; {cite.10.'Forster_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Free_2011}). One robust feature is the observed cooling in spring over the Antarctic, which is simulated in response to stratospheric ozone depletion in climate models ({cite.10.'Young_et_al_2012}), although this has not been the subject of a formal {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and attribution study.

Since AR4, progress has been made in simulating the response of global mean lower stratosphere temperatures to natural and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} by improving the representation of climate forcings and utilizing models that include more stratospheric processes. New detection and attribution studies of lower stratospheric temperature changes made since AR4 support an assessment that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, dominated by stratospheric ozone depletion due to ozone-depleting substances, has led to a detectable cooling of the lower stratosphere since 1979.
