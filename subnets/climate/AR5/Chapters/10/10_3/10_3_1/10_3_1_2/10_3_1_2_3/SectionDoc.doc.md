title: 10.3.1.2.3 - Overall atmospheric temperature change

When temperature trends from the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} are analysed together, {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} using CMIP5 models show robust detections of the effects of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} on the distinctive {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling seen since 1961 in radiosonde data ({cite.10.'Lott_et_al_2013}; {cite.10.'Mitchell_et_al_2013}). Combining the evidence from free {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} changes from both troposphere and stratosphere shows an increased confidence in the attribution of free {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} temperature changes compared to {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} owing to improved understanding of stratospheric temperature changes. There is therefore stronger evidence than at the time of AR4 to support the conclusion that it is very likely that {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing, particularly GHGs and stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} depletion, has led to a detectable observed pattern of tropospheric warming and lower stratospheric cooling since 1961.
