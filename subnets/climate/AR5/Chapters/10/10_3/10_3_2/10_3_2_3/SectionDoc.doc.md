title: 10.3.2.3 - Changes in Surface Hydrologic Variables

This subsection assesses recent research on detection and attribution of long-term changes in continental surface hydrologic variables, including {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}, {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration} and {Glossary.*Streamflow streamflow}. Streamflows are often subject to large non-climatic {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence}, such as diversions and land use changes, that must be accounted for in order to attribute detected hydrologic changes to climate change. Cryospheric aspects of surface hydrology are discussed in {Chapters.10.10_5 Section 10.5}; extremes in surface hydrology (such as drought) and precipitation are covered in {Chapters.10.10_6.10_6_1 Section 10.6.1}. The variables discussed here are subject to large modeling {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({Chapters.9 Chapter 9}) and observational challenges ({Chapters.2 Chapter 2}), which in combination place severe limits on climate change detection and attribution.

Direct observational records of soil moisture and surface fluxes tend to be sparse and/or short, thus limiting recent assessments of change in these variables ({cite.10.'Jung_et_al_2010}). Assimilated land surface data sets and new satellite observations ({Chapters.2 Chapter 2}) are promising tools, but assessment of past and future climate change of these variables ({cite.10.'Hoekema_and_Sridhar_2011}) is still generally carried out on derived quantities such as the Palmer {Glossary.*Drought Drought} Severity Index, as discussed more fully in {Chapters.10.10_6.10_6_1 Section 10.6.1}. Recent observations ({cite.10.'Jung_et_al_2010}) show regional trends towards drier soils. An optimal detection analysis of reconstructed evapotranspiration identifies the effects of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing on evapotranspiration, with the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM)-CM5 model simulating changes consistent with those estimated to have occurred ({cite.10.'Douville_et_al_2013}).

Trends towards earlier timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in western North America since 1950 have been demonstrated to be different from natural variability ({cite.10.'Hidalgo_et_al_2009}). Similarly, {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} associated with natural decade-scale fluctuations could not account for recent observed declines of northern Rocky Mountain streamflow (St Jacques et al., 2010). Statistical analyses of streamflows demonstrate regionally varying changes that are consistent with changes expected from increasing temperature, in Scandinavia ({cite.10.'Wilson_et_al_2010}), Europe ({cite.10.'Stahl_et_al_2010}) and the USA ({cite.10.'Krakauer_and_Fung_2008}; {cite.10.'Wang_and_Hejazi_2011}). Observed increases in Arctic {Glossary.*River_discharge river discharge}, which could be a good integrator for monitoring changes in precipitation in high latitudes, are found to be explainable only if model simulations include {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} ({cite.10.'Min_et_al_2008a}).

{cite.10.'Barnett_et_al_2008 Barnett et al. (2008)} analysed changes in the surface hydrology of the western USA, considering snow pack (measured as {Glossary.*Snow_water_equivalent snow water equivalent}), the seasonal timing of streamflow in major rivers, and average January to March daily minimum temperature over the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, the two hydrological variables they studied being closely related to temperature. Observed changes were compared with the output of a regional hydrologic model forced by the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate (MIROC) {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. They derived a {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} of anthropogenic changes from the two climate models and found that the observations, when {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} onto the fingerprint of anthropogenic changes, show a positive signal strength consistent with the model simulations that falls outside the range expected from internal variability as estimated from 1600 years of downscaled climate model data. They conclude that there is a detectable and attributable anthropogenic signature on the hydrology of this region.

In summary, there is medium confidence that human influence on climate has affected stream flow and evapotranspiration in limited regions of middle and high latitudes of the NH. {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} have been applied only to limited regions and using a few models. Observational uncertainties are large and in the case of evapotranspiration depend on reconstructions using land surface models.
