{Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} and attribution studies of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} change in hydrologic variables are challenged by the length and quality of observed data sets, and by the difficulty in simulating hydrologic variables in dynamical models. {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} cautiously noted that the observed increase in atmospheric water vapour over oceans was consistent with warming of SSTs {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to anthropogenic influence, and that observed changes in the latitudinal distribution of precipitation, and increased incidence of {Glossary.*Drought drought}, were suggestive of a possible {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence}. Many of the published studies cited in AR4, and some of the studies cited in this section, use less formal detection and attribution criteria than are often used for assessments of temperature change, owing to difficulties defining large-scale {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} patterns of hydrologic change in models and isolating those fingerprints in data. For example, correlations between observed hydrologic changes and the patterns of change in models forced by increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} can provide suggestive evidence towards attribution of change.

Since the publication of AR4, in situ hydrologic data sets have been reanalysed with more stringent quality control. Satellite-derived data records of worldwide water vapour and precipitation variations have lengthened. Formal detection and attribution studies have been carried out with newer models that potentially offer better simulations of natural variability. Reviews of detection and attribution of trends in various components of the {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} have been published by {cite.10.'Stott_et_al_2010 Stott et al. (2010)} and {cite.10.'Trenberth_2011b Trenberth (2011b)}.
