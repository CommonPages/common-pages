title: 10.3.2.1 - Changes in Atmospheric Water Vapour
section 10_3_2_1

  |In situ surface humidity observations indicate significant increases in surface {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} between 1973 and 2003. Simulations of the response to historical {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} robustly generate an increase in atmospheric humidity consistent with observations. An anthropogenic contribution to increases in specific humidity at and near the Earthâ€™s surface is found with medium confidence. Evidence of a recent levelling off of the {Glossary.*Trend trend} needs to be better understood and simulated as a prerequisite to increased confidence in {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} of water vapour changes.
