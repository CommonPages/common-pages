title: 10.3.2.1 - Changes in Atmospheric Water Vapour

In situ surface humidity measurements have been reprocessed since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} to create new gridded analyses for climatic research, as discussed in {Chapters.2 Chapter 2}. The HadCRUH Surface Humidity data set ({cite.10.'Willett_et_al_2008}) indicates significant increases in surface {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} between 1973 and 2003 averaged over the globe, the tropics, and the NH, with consistently larger trends in the tropics and in the NH during summer, and negative or non significant trends in {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity}. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the distribution of relative humidity should remain roughly constant under climate change (see {Chapters.2.2_5 Section 2.5}). Simulations of the response to historical {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural forcings robustly generate an increase in atmospheric humidity consistent with observations ({cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Willett_et_al_2007}; {'Figure_9_9 Figure 9.9}). A recent cessation of the upward {Glossary.*Trend trend} in specific humidity is observed over multiple continental areas in HadCRUH and is also found in the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) interim {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} of the global {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and surface conditions (ERA-Interim; Simmons et al. 2010). This change in the specific humidity trend is temporally correlated with a levelling off of global ocean temperatures following the 1997–1998 El Niño event ({cite.10.'Simmons_et_al_2010}).

The anthropogenic water vapour {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} simulated by an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of 22 {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} has been identified in lower tropospheric moisture content estimates derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data covering the period 1988–2006 ({cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2007}). {cite.10.'Santer_et_al_2009 Santer et al. (2009)} find that {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} of an anthropogenic response in column water vapour is insensitive to the set of models used. They rank models based on their ability to simulate the observed mean total column water vapour, and its annual cycle and variability associated with {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}. They report no appreciable differences between the fingerprints or detection results derived from the best or worst performing models, and so conclude that attribution of water vapour changes to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} is not sensitive to the choice of models used for the assessment.

In summary, an anthropogenic contribution to increases in specific humidity at and near the Earth’s surface is found with medium confidence. Evidence of a recent levelling off of the long-term surface atmospheric moistening trend over land needs to be better understood and simulated as a prerequisite to increased confidence in {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} of water vapour changes. Length and quality of observational humidity data sets, especially above the surface, continue to limit detection and attribution studies of atmospheric water vapour.
