title: 10.3.3.4 - Change in Global Sea Level Pressure Patterns

A number of studies have applied formal {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} to global fields of atmospheric SLP finding detection of {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} on global patterns of SLP ({cite.10.'Gillett_et_al_2003}, 2005; {cite.10.'Gillett_and_Stott_2009}). Analysing the contributions of different {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} to observed changes in SLP, {cite.10.'Gillett_and_Stott_2009 Gillett and Stott (2009)} find separately detectable influences of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural forcings in zonal mean seasonal mean SLP, strengthening evidence for a human influence on SLP. Based on the robustness of the evidence from multiple models we conclude that it is likely that human influence has altered SLP patterns globally since 1951.
