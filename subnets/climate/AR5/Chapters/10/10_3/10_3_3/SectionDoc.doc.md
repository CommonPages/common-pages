title: 10.3.3 - Atmospheric Circulation and Patterns of Variability

The atmospheric circulation is driven by various processes including the uneven heating of the Earth’s surface by {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}, land–sea contrast and orography. The circulation transports heat from warm to cold regions and thereby acts to reduce temperature contrasts. Thus, changes in circulation and in patterns of variability are of critical importance for the climate system, influencing {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} and regional {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. Any such changes are important for local climate change because they could act to reinforce or counteract the effects of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} on climate in a particular region. Observed changes in atmospheric circulation and patterns of variability are assessed in {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_5 Section 2.7.5}. Although new and improved data sets are now available, changes in patterns of variability remain difficult to detect because of large variability on interannual to decadal time scales ({Chapters.2.2_7 Section 2.7}).

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, progress has been made in understanding the causes of changes in circulation-related climate phenomena and modes of variability such as the width of the tropical circulation, and the Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}). For other climate phenomena, such as {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, Indian Ocean Dipole ({Glossary.*Indian_Ocean_Dipole IOD}), Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}), and monsoons, there are large observational and modelling {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} (see {Chapters.9.9_5 Section 9.5} and {Chapters.14 Chapter 14}), and there is low confidence that changes in these phenomena, if observed, can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to human-induced influence.
