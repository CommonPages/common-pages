title: 10.3.3.1 - Tropical Circulation

Various indicators of the width of the tropical belt based on independent data sets suggest that the tropical belt as a whole has widened since 1979; however, the magnitude of this change is very uncertain ({cite.10.'Fu_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Hudson_et_al_2006}; {cite.10.'Hu_and_Fu_2007}; {cite.10.'Seidel_and_Randel_2007}; {cite.10.'Seidel_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Lu_et_al_2009}; {cite.10.'Fu_and_Lin_2011}; {cite.10.'Hu_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2012}; {cite.10.'Lucas_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Wilcox_et_al_2012}; {cite.10.'Nguyen_et_al_2013}) ({Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_5 Section 2.7.5}). CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations suggest that {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} have contributed to the observed widening of the tropical belt since 1979 ({cite.10.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}; {cite.10.'Hu_et_al_2013}). On average the poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation and other indicators of the width of the tropical belt is greater than determined from CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations ({cite.10.'Seidel_et_al_2008}; {cite.10.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}; {cite.10.'Hu_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_10_12 Figure 10.12}). The causes as to why models underestimate the observed poleward expansion of the tropical belt are not fully understood. Potential factors are lack of understanding of the magnitude of natural variability as well as changes in observing systems that also affect reanalysis products ({cite.10.'Thorne_and_Vose_2010}; {cite.10.'Lucas_et_al_2012}; {Box_2_3 Box 2.3}).

{Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate model} simulations suggest that Antarctic {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} depletion is a major factor in causing poleward expansion of the southern Hadley cell during austral summer over the last three to five decades with {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} also playing a role ({cite.10.'Son_et_al_2008}, 2009, 2010; {cite.10.'McLandress_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Polvani_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Hu_et_al_2013}). In {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis data} a detectable signal of ozone forcing is separable from other {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} including GHGs when utilizing both CMIP5 and CMIP3 simulations combined ({cite.10.'Min_and_Son_2013}). An analysis of CMIP3 simulations suggests that {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} aerosols and tropospheric ozone were the main drivers of the observed poleward expansion of the northern Hadley cell in boreal summer ({cite.10.'Allen_et_al_2012}). It is found that global greenhouse warming causes increase in static stability, such that the onset of baroclinicity is shifted poleward, leading to poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation ({cite.10.'Frierson_2006}; {cite.10.'Frierson_et_al_2007}; {cite.10.'Hu_and_Fu_2007}; {cite.10.'Lu_et_al_2007}, 2008). Tropical {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} increase may also contribute to a widening of the Hadley circulation ({cite.10.'Hu_et_al_2011}; {cite.10.'Staten_et_al_2012}). Althoughe some Atmospheric {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model General Circulation Model} (AGCM) simulations forced by observed time-varying SSTs yield a widening by about 1° in latitude over 1979–2002 ({cite.10.'Hu_et_al_2011}), other simulations suggest that SST changes have little effect on the tropical expansion when based on the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} {Glossary.*Metric metric} of the tropical width ({cite.10.'Lu_et_al_2009}). However, it is found that the tropopause metric is not very reliable because of the use of arbitrary thresholds ({cite.10.'Birner_2010}; {cite.10.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2012}).

In summary, there are {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence} that the Hadley cell and the tropical belt as a whole have widened since at least 1979; however, the magnitude of the widening is very uncertain. Based on modelling studies there is medium confidence that stratospheric ozone depletion has contributed to the observed poleward shift of the southern Hadley cell border during austral summer, with GHGs also playing a role. The contribution of internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} to the observed poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation remains very uncertain.
