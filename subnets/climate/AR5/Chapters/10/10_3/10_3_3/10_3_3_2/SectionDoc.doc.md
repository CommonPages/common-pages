title: 10.3.3.2 - Northern Annular Mode/North Atlantic Oscillation

The {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, which exhibited a positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} from the 1960s to the 1990s, has since exhibited lower values, with exceptionally low anomalies in the winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 ({Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_8 Section 2.7.8}). This means that the positive trend in the NAO discussed in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} has considerably weakened when evaluated up to 2011. Similar results apply to the closely related Northern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM}), with its upward trend over the past 60 years in the 20th Century {Topics.*Reanalysis Reanalysis} ({cite.10.'Compo_et_al_2011}) and in Hadley Centre Sea Level Pressure data set 2r (HadSLP2r; {cite.10.'Allan_and_Ansell_2006}) not being significant compared to {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} ({'Figure_10_13 Figure 10.13}). An analysis of CMIP5 models shows that they simulate positive trends in NAM in the DJF season over this period, albeit not as large as those observed which are still within the range of natural internal variability ({'Figure_10_13 Figure 10.13}).

Other work ({cite.10.'Woollings_2008}) demonstrates that while the NAM is largely barotropic in structure, the simulated response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} has a strong baroclinic component, with an opposite geopotential height trends in the mid-{Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} compared to the surface in many models. Thus while the circulation response to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing may project onto the NAM, it is not entirely captured by the NAM index.

Consistent with previous findings ({cite.10.'Hegerl_et_al_2007b}), {cite.10.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013 Gillett and Fyfe (2013)} find that {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} tend to drive a positive NAM response in the CMIP5 models. Recent modelling work also indicates that {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} changes drive a small positive NAM response in spring ({cite.10.'Morgenstern_et_al_2010}; {cite.10.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013}).
