title: Box 12.2 - Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity and Transient Climate Response

Equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (ECS) and transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} (TCR) are useful metrics summarizing the global climate system’s temperature response to an externally imposed {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF). ECS is defined as the equilibrium change in annual mean global {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} following a doubling of the atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration (see Glossary), while TCR is defined as the annual mean global {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} change at the time of CO2 doubling following a linear increase in CO2 forcing over a period of 70 years (see Glossary). Both metrics have a broader application than these definitions imply: ECS determines the eventual warming in response to stabilization of atmospheric composition on multi-century time scales, while TCR determines the warming expected at a given time following any steady increase in forcing over a 50to 100-year time scale.

ECS and TCR can be estimated from various lines of evidence. The estimates can be based on the values of ECS and TCR diagnosed from {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_1 Section 9.7.1}; {'Table_9_5 Table 9.5}), or they can be constrained by analysis of feedbacks in climate models (see {Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_2 Section 9.7.2}), patterns of mean climate and variability in models compared to observations ({Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_3.9_7_3_3 Section 9.7.3.3}), temperature fluctuations as reconstructed from {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} archives (Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 5.3.1} and {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 5.3.3.2}; {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}), observed and modelled short-term perturbations of the {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} like those caused by volcanic eruptions ({Chapters.10.10_8 Section 10.8}), and the observed surface and ocean temperature trends since pre-industrial (see Sections {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_1 10.8.1} and {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2 10.8.2}; {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}). For many applications, the limitations of the forcing-{Glossary.*Feedback feedback} analysis framework and the dependence of feedbacks on time scales and the climate state (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}) must be kept in mind. Some studies estimate the TCR as the ratio of global mean temperature change to RF ({Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2.10_8_2_2 Section 10.8.2.2}) ({cite.12.'Gregory_and_Forster_2008}; {cite.12.'Padilla_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Schwartz_2012}). Those estimates are scaled by the RF of 2 × CO2 (3.7 W m–2; {cite.12.'Myhre_et_al_1998}) to be comparable to TCR in the following discussion.

Newer studies of constraints based on the observed warming since pre-industrial, analysed using simple and intermediate complexity models, improved statistical methods, and several different and newer data sets, are assessed in detail in {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2 Section 10.8.2}. Together with results from feedback analysis and paleoclimate constraints (Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 5.3.1} and {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 5.3.3.2}; {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}), but without considering the CMIP based evidence, these studies show ECS is likely between 1.5°C to 4.5°C (medium confidence) and extremely unlikely less than 1.0°C (see {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2 Section 10.8.2}). A few studies argued for very low values of climate sensitivity, but many of them have received criticism in the literature (see {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2 Section 10.8.2}). Estimates based on {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} and feedback analysis indicate a range of 2°C to 4.5°C, with the CMIP5 model mean at 3.2°C, similar to CMIP3. A summary of published ranges and PDFs of ECS is given in {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}, {'Box_12_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}. Distributions and ranges for the TCR are shown in {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}, {'Box_12_2_Figure_2 Figure 2}.

Simultaneously imposing different constraints from the observed warming trends, volcanic eruptions, model climatology, and paleoclimate, for example, by using a distribution obtained from the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum Last Glacial Maximum} as a prior for the 20th century analysis, yields a more narrow range for climate sensitivity (see {'Figure_10_20 Figure 10.20}; {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2.10_8_2_5 Section 10.8.2.5}) (e.g., {cite.12.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2006}, 2011b; {cite.12.'Hegerl_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Aldrin_et_al_2012}). However, such methods are sensitive to assumptions of independence of the various lines of evidence, which might have shared biases ({cite.12.'Lemoine_2010}), and the assumption that each individual line of evidence is unbiased and its {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are captured completely. Expert elicitations for PDFs of climate sensitivity exist ({cite.12.'Morgan_and_Keith_1995}; {cite.12.'Zickfeld_et_al_2010}), but have also received some criticism ({cite.12.'Millner_et_al_2013}). They are not used formally here because the experts base their opinion on the same studies as we assess. The peer-reviewed literature provides no consensus on a formal statistical method to combine different lines of evidence. All methods in general are sensitive to the assumed prior distributions. These limitations are discussed in detail in {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2 Section 10.8.2}.

Based on the combined evidence from observed climate change including the observed 20th century warming, climate models, feedback analysis and paleoclimate, ECS is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C with high confidence. The combined evidence increases the confidence in this final assessment compared to that based

on the observed warming and paleoclimate only. ECS is positive, extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence). The upper limit of the likely range is unchanged compared to {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. The lower limit of the likely range of 1.5°C is less than the lower limit of 2°C in AR4. This change reflects the evidence from new studies of observed temperature change, using the extended records in {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and ocean. These studies suggest a best fit to the observed surface and ocean warming for ECS values in the lower part of the likely range. Note that these studies are not purely observational, because they require an estimate of the response to RF from models. In addition, the uncertainty in ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} remains substantial (see {Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}, {Box_13_1 Box 13.1}). Accounting for short term variability in simple models remains challenging, and it is important not to give undue weight to any short time period that might be strongly affected by {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} (see {Box_9_2 Box 9.2}). On the other hand, AOGCMs show very good agreement with observed climatology with ECS values in the upper part of the 1.5°C to 4.5°C range ({Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_3.9_7_3_3 Section 9.7.3.3}), but the simulation of key feedbacks like clouds remains challenging in those models. The estimates from the observed warming, paleoclimate, and from climate models are consistent within their uncertainties, each is supported by many studies and multiple data sets, and in combination they provide high confidence for the assessed likely range. Even though this assessed range is similar to previous reports ({cite.12.'Charney_1979}; {cite.12.'IPCC_2001}), confidence today is much higher as a result of high quality and longer observational records with a clearer {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} signal, better process understanding, more and better understood evidence from paleoclimate reconstructions, and better climate models with higher {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} that capture many more processes more realistically. {Box_12_2 Box 12.2} Figure 1 illustrates that all these lines of evidence individually support the assessed likely range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C.

The tails of the ECS distribution are now better understood. {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change Multiple lines of evidence} provide high confidence that an ECS value less than 1°C is extremely unlikely. The assessment that ECS is very unlikely greater than 6°C is an expert judgment informed by several lines of evidence. First, the comprehensive climate models used in the CMIP5 exercise produce an ECS range of 2.1°C to 4.7°C ({'Table_9_5 Table 9.5}), very similar to CMIP3. Second, comparisons of perturbed-physics ensembles against the observed climate find that models with ECS values in the range 3°C to 4°C show the smallest errors for many fields ({Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_3.9_7_3_3 Section 9.7.3.3}). Third, there is increasing evidence that the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} RF of the 20th century is not strongly negative, which makes it unlikely that the observed warming was caused by a very large ECS in response to a very small net forcing. Fourth, multiple and at least partly independent observational constraints from the satellite period, instrumental period and palaeoclimate studies continue to yield very low probabilities for ECS larger than 6°C, particularly when including most recent ocean and atmospheric data (see {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}, {'Box_12_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}).

Analyses of observations and simulations of the instrumental period are estimating the effective climate sensitivity (a measure of the strengths of the climate feedbacks today, see Glossary), rather than ECS directly. In some climate models ECS tends to be higher than the effective climate sensitivity (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}), because the feedbacks that are represented in the models (water vapour, {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate}, {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and clouds) vary with the climate state. On time scales of many centuries, additional feedbacks with their own intrinsic time scales (e.g., vegetation, ice sheets; see Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3 5.3.3} and {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 12.5.3}) ({cite.12.'Jones_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Goelzer_et_al_2011}) may become important but are not usually modelled. The resulting {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} sensitivity is less well constrained but likely to be larger than ECS ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Rohling_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Lunt_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Pagani_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Rohling_and_Members_2012}), implying that lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations are needed to meet a given temperature target on multi-century time scales. A number of caveats, however, apply to those studies (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}). Those long-term feedbacks have their own intrinsic time scales, and are less likely to be proportional to global mean temperature change.

For {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} of increasing RF, TCR is a more informative indicator of future climate than ECS ({cite.12.'Frame_et_al_2005}; {cite.12.'Held_et_al_2010}). This assessment concludes with high confidence that the TCR is likely in the range 1°C to 2.5°C, close to the estimated 5 to 95% range of CMIP5 (1.2°C to 2.4°C; see {'Table_9_5 Table 9.5}), is positive and extremely unlikely greater than 3°C. As with the ECS, this is an expert-assessed range, supported by several different and partly independent lines of evidence, each based on multiple studies, models and data sets. TCR is estimated from the observed global changes in surface temperature, ocean heat uptake and RF, the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection}/{Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} identifying the response patterns to increasing GHG concentrations ({Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_1 Section 10.8.1}), and the results of CMIP3 and CMIP5 ({Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_1 Section 9.7.1}). Estimating TCR suffers from fewer difficulties in terms of stateor time-dependent feedbacks (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}), and is less affected by uncertainty as to how much energy is taken up by the ocean. Unlike ECS, the ranges of TCR estimated from the observed warming and from AOGCMs agree well, increasing our confidence in the assessment of uncertainties in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} over the 21st century.

Another useful {Glossary.*Metric metric} relating directly CO2 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} to temperature is the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emission ({Glossary.*Transient_climate_response_to_cumulative_CO2_emissions TCRE}) (see Sections {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_4 12.5.4} and {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_4 10.8.4}). This metric is useful to determine the allowed cumulative carbon emissions for stabilization at a specific global temperature. TCRE is defined as the annual mean global surface temperature change per unit of cumulated CO2 emissions, usually 1000 PgC, in a scenario with continuing emissions (see Glossary). It considers physical and {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} feedbacks and uncertainties, but not additional feedbacks associated for example with the release of methane hydrates or large amounts of carbon from {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost}. The assessment based on climate models as well as the observed warming suggests that the TCRE is likely between 0.8°C to 2.5°C per 1000 PgC (1012 metric tons of carbon), for cumulative CO2 emissions less than about 2000 PgC until the time at which temperatures peak. Under these conditions, and for low to medium estimates of climate sensitivity, the TCRE gives an accurate estimate of the peak global mean temperature response to cumulated carbon emissions. TCRE has the advantage of directly relating {Glossary.*Global_mean_surface_temperature global mean surface temperature} change to CO2 emissions, but as a result of combining the uncertainty in both TCR and the carbon cycle response, it is more uncertain. It also ignores non-CO2 forcings and the fact that other components of the climate system (e.g., {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise, ice sheets) have their own intrinsic time scales, resulting in climate change not avoided by limiting global temperature change.
