title: 12.2.4 - Joint Projections of Multiple Variables

While many of the key processes relevant to the simulation of single variables are understood, studies are only starting to focus on assessing {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of joint variables, especially when extremes or variability in the individual quantities are of concern. A few studies have addressed projected changes in joint variables, for example, by combining mean temperature and precipitation ({cite.12.'Williams_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Tebaldi_and_Lobell_2008}; {cite.12.'Tebaldi_and_Sanso_2009}; {cite.12.'Watterson_2011}; {cite.12.'Watterson_and_Whetton_2011a}; {cite.12.'Sexton_et_al_2012}), linking {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}, precipitation and temperature mean and variability ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2006}; Fischer and Schär, 2009; {cite.12.'Koster_et_al_2009b}, 2009c), combining temperature and humidity ({cite.12.'Diffenbaugh_et_al_2007}; Fischer and Schär, 2010; {cite.12.'Willett_and_Sherwood_2012}), linking summertime temperature and soil moisture to prior winter snowpack ({cite.12.'Hall_et_al_2008}) or linking precipitation change to circulation, moisture and moist static {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} changes ({cite.12.'Neelin_et_al_2003}; {cite.12.'Chou_and_Neelin_2004}; {cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2006}, 2009). Models may have difficulties simulating all relevant interactions between {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and land surface and the {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} that determine the joint response, observations to evaluate models are often limited ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2010}), and model {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are therefore large ({cite.12.'Koster_et_al_2006}; Boé and Terray, 2008; {cite.12.'Notaro_2008}; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2011}). In some cases, correlations between, for example, temperature and precipitation or accumulated precipitation and temperature have found to be too strong in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.12.'Trenberth_and_Shea_2005}; {cite.12.'Hirschi_et_al_2011}). The situation is further complicated by the fact that model biases in one variable affect other variables. The standard method for model projections is to subtract model biases derived from control integrations (assuming that the bias remains constant in a future scenario integration). Several studies note that this may be problematic when a consistent treatment of biases in multiple variables is required ({cite.12.'Christensen_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Buser_et_al_2009}), but there is no consensus at this stage for a methodology addressing this problem ({cite.12.'Ho_et_al_2012}). More generally the existence of structural errors in models according to which an unavoidable discrepancy ({cite.12.'Rougier_2007}) between their simulations and reality cannot be avoided is relevant here, as well as for univariate projections. In the recent literature an estimate of this discrepancy has been proposed through the use of MMEs, using each model in turn as a surrogate for reality, and measuring the distance between it and the other models of the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}. Some summary statistic of these measures is then used to estimate the distance between models and the real world ({cite.12.'Sexton_and_Murphy_2012}; {cite.12.'Sexton_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Sanderson_2013}). Statistical frameworks to deal with multivariate projections are challenging even for just two variables, as they have to address a trade-off between modelling the joint behavior at scales that are relevant for impacts— that is, fine {Glossary.*Spatial_and_temporal_scales spatial and temporal scales}, often requiring complex spatio-temporal models—and maintaining computational feasibility. In one instance ({cite.12.'Tebaldi_and_Sanso_2009}) scales were investigated at the seasonal and sub-continental level, and projections of the forced response of temperature and precipitation at those scales did not show significant correlations, likely because of the heterogeneity of the relation between the variables within those large averaged regions and seasons. In {cite.12.'Sexton_et_al_2012 Sexton et al. (2012)} the spatial scale focussed on regions of Great Britain and correlation emerged as more significant, for example, between summer temperatures and precipitation amounts. {cite.12.'Fischer_and_Knutti_2013 Fischer and Knutti (2013)} estimated strong relationships between variables making up impact relevant indices (e.g., temperature and humidity) and showed how in some cases, uncertainties across models are larger for a combined variable than if the uncertainties in the individual underlying variables were treated independently (e.g., wildfires), whereas in other cases the uncertainties in the combined variables are smaller than in the individual ones (e.g., heat stress for humans).

Even while recognizing the need for joint multivariate projections, the above limitations at this stage prevent a quantitative assessment for most cases. A few robust qualitative relationships nonetheless emerge from the literature and these are assessed, where appropriate, in the rest of the chapter. For applications that are sensitive to relationships between variables, but still choose to use the multi-model framework to determine possible ranges for projections, sampling from univariate ranges may lead to unrealistic results when significant correlations exist. IPCC assessments often show model averages as best estimates, but such averages can underestimate spatial variability, and more in general they neither represent any of the actual model states ({cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2010a}) nor do they necessarily represent the joint best estimate in a multivariate sense. Impact studies usually need temporally and spatially coherent multivariate input from climate model simulations. In those cases, using each climate model output individually and feeding it into the impact model, rather than trying to summarise a multivariate distribution from the MME and sample from it, is likely to be more consistent, assuming that the climate model itself correctly captures the spatial covariance, the temporal co-evolution and the relevant feedbacks.
