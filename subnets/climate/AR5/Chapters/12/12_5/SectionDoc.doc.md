title: 12.5 - Climate Change Beyond 2100, Commitment, Stabilization and Irreversibility

This section discusses the long term (century to millennia) climate change based on the RCP scenario extensions and idealized {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, the commitment from current atmospheric composition and from past {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, the concept of cumulative carbon and the resulting constraints on emissions for various temperature targets. The term {Glossary.*Irreversibility irreversibility} is used in various ways in the literature. This report defines a perturbed state as irreversible on a given time scale if the recovery time scale from this state due to natural processes is significantly longer than the time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state (see Glossary), for example, the climate change resulting from the long residence time of a {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} perturbation in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. These results are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_2 Section 12.5.2} to 12.5.4. Aspects of irreversibility in the context of abrupt change, multiple steady states and hysteresis are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5 Section 12.5.5} and in {Chapters.13 Chapter 13} for ice sheets and {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise.
