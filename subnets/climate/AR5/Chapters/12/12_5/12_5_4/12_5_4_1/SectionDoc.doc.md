title: 12.5.4.1 - Background

The concept of stabilization is strongly linked to the ultimate objective of the {Glossary.*United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change UNFCCC}, which is ‘to achieve [...] stabilization of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} concentrations in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} at a level that would prevent dangerous {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} interference with the climate system’. Recent policy discussions focussed on a global temperature increase, rather than on GHG concentrations. The most prominent target currently discussed is the 2°C temperature target, that is, to limit global temperature increase relative to pre-industrial times to below 2°C. The 2°C target has been used first by the European Union as a policy target in 1996 but can be traced further back ({cite.12.'Jaeger_and_Jaeger_2010}; {cite.12.'Randalls_2010}). Climate impacts however are geographically diverse ({cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2011}) and sector specific, and no objective threshold defines when dangerous interference is reached. Some changes may be delayed or irreversible, and some impacts are likely to be beneficial. It is thus not possible to define a single critical threshold without value judgments and without assumptions on how to aggregate current and future costs and benefits. Targets other than 2°C have been proposed (e.g., 1.5°C global warming relative to pre-industrial), or targets based on {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration levels, for example, 350 ppm ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2008}). The rate of change may also be important (e.g., for adaptation). This section does not advocate or defend any threshold, nor does it judge the economic or political feasibility of such goals, but simply assesses the implications of different illustrative climate targets on allowed carbon {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, based on our current understanding of climate and {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} feedbacks.
