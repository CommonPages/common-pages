title: 12.5.4 - Climate Stabilization and Long-term Climate Targets

This section discusses the relation between {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and climate targets, in the context of the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} characterizing both the transient and the equilibrium climate responses to emissions. ‘Climate targets’ considered here are both stabilizing temperature at a specified value and avoiding a warming beyond a predefined threshold.

The latter idea of limiting peak warming is a more general concept than stabilization of temperature or atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, and one that is more realistic than an exact climate stabilization which would require perpetual non-zero positive emissions to counteract the otherwise unavoidable long-term slow decrease in global temperature ({cite.12.'Matsuno_et_al_2012a}) ({'Figure_12_44 Figure 12.44}).
