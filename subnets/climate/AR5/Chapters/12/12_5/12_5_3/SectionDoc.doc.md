title: 12.5.3 - Forcing and Response, Time Scales of Feedbacks

Equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (ECS), transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} (TCR) and climate feedbacks are useful concepts to characterize the response of a model to an {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} perturbation. However, there are limitations to the concept of RF ({cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2003}; {cite.12.'Shine_et_al_2003}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2005b}; {cite.12.'Stuber_et_al_2005}), and the separation of forcings and fast (or rapid) responses (e.g., clouds changing almost instantaneously as a result of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}-induced heating rates rather than as a response to the slower surface warming) is sometimes difficult ({cite.12.'Andrews_and_Forster_2008}; {cite.12.'Gregory_and_Webb_2008}). Equilibrium warming also depends on the type of forcing ({cite.12.'Stott_et_al_2003}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2005b}; {cite.12.'Davin_et_al_2007}). ECS is time or state dependent in some models ({cite.12.'Senior_and_Mitchell_2000}; {cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Boer_et_al_2005}; {cite.12.'Williams_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Colman_and_McAvaney_2009}; {cite.12.'Colman_and_Power_2010}), and in some but not all models climate sensitivity from a slab ocean version differs from that of coupled models or the effective climate sensitivity (see Glossary) diagnosed from a transient coupled integration ({cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Danabasoglu_and_Gent_2009}; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2013a}). The computational cost of coupled {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} is often prohibitively large to run simulations to full equilibrium, and only a few models have performed those ({cite.12.'Manabe_and_Stouffer_1994}; {cite.12.'Voss_and_Mikolajewicz_2001}; {cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Danabasoglu_and_Gent_2009}; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2013a}). Because of the time dependence of effective climate sensitivity, fitting simple models to AOGCMs over the first few centuries may lead to errors when inferring the response on multi-century time scales. In the HadCM3 case the long-term warming would be underestimated by 30% if extrapolated from the first century ({cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2004}), in other models the warming of the slab and coupled model is almost identical ({cite.12.'Danabasoglu_and_Gent_2009}). The assumption that the response to different forcings is approximately additive appears to be justified for large-scale temperature changes but limited for other climate variables ({cite.12.'Boer_and_Yu_2003}; {cite.12.'Sexton_et_al_2003}; {cite.12.'Gillett_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Jones_et_al_2007}). A more complete discussion of the concept of ECS and the limitations is given in {cite.12.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008 Knutti and Hegerl (2008)}. The CMIP5 model estimates of ECS and TCR are also discussed in {Chapters.9.9_7 Section 9.7}. Despite all limitations, the ECS and TCR remain key concepts to characterize the transient and near equilibrium warming as a response to RF on time scales of centuries. Their overall assessment is given in {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}.

A number of recent studies suggest that equilibrium climate sensitivities determined from AOGCMs and recent warming trends may significantly underestimate the true {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} sensitivity (see Glossary) which is realized when equilibration is reached on millennial time scales ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Rohling_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Lunt_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Pagani_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Rohling_and_Members_2012}). The argument is that slow feedbacks associated with vegetation changes and ice sheets have their own intrinsic long time scales and are not represented in most models ({cite.12.'Jones_et_al_2009}). Additional feedbacks are mostly thought to be positive but negative feedbacks of smaller magnitude are also simulated ({cite.12.'Swingedouw_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Goelzer_et_al_2011}). The climate sensitivity of a model may therefore not reflect the sensitivity of the full Earth system because those {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} processes are not considered (see also Sections {Chapters.10.10_8 10.8}, {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 5.3.1} and {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 5.3.3.2}; {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}). Feedbacks determined in very different base state (e.g., the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum Last Glacial Maximum}) differ from those in the current warm period ({cite.12.'Rohling_and_Members_2012}), and relationships between observables and climate sensitivity are model dependent ({cite.12.'Crucifix_2006}; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2006; {cite.12.'Edwards_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Hargreaves_et_al_2007}, 2012). Estimates of climate sensitivity based on {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} archives ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Rohling_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Lunt_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Pagani_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Schmittner_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Rohling_and_Members_2012}), most but not all based on climate states colder than present, are therefore not necessarily representative for an estimate of climate sensitivity today (see also Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 5.3.1} {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 5.3.3.2}, {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}). Also it is uncertain on which time scale some of those Earth system feedbacks would become significant.

{Glossary.*Equilibrium_climate_sensitivity Equilibrium climate sensitivity} undoubtedly remains a key quantity, useful to relate a change in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} or other forcings to a global temperature change. But the above caveats imply that estimates based on {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} states very different from today, estimates based on time scales different than those relevant for climate stabilization (e.g., estimates based on climate response to volcanic eruptions), or based on forcings other than GHGs (e.g., spatially non-uniform land cover changes, volcanic eruptions or solar forcing) may differ from the climate sensitivity measuring the climate feedbacks of the Earth system today, and this measure, in turn, may be slightly different from the sensitivity of the Earth in a much warmer state on time scales of millennia. The TCR and the transient climate response to cumulative carbon {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({Glossary.*Transient_climate_response_to_cumulative_CO2_emissions TCRE}) are often more directly relevant to evaluate short term changes and emission reductions needed for stabilization (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_4 Section 12.5.4}).
