title: 12.5.5.6.2 - Boreal forest

Evidence from field observations and biogeochemical modelling make it scientifically conceivable that regions of the boreal {Glossary.*Forest forest} could tip into a different vegetation state under climate warming, but {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} on the {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of this occurring are very high ({cite.12.'Lenton_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Allen_et_al_2010}). This is mainly due to large gaps in knowledge concerning relevant ecosystemic and plant physiological responses to warming ({cite.12.'Niinemets_2010}). The main response is a potential advancement of the boreal forest northward and the potential transition from a forest to a woodland or grassland state on its dry southern edges in the continental interiors, leading to an overall increase in herbaceous vegetation cover in the affected parts of the boreal zone ({cite.12.'Lucht_et_al_2006}). The proposed potential mechanisms for decreased forest growth and/or increased forest mortality are: increased {Glossary.*Drought drought} stress under warmer summer conditions in regions with low {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} ({cite.12.'Barber_et_al_2000}; {cite.12.'Dulamsuren_et_al_2009}, 2010); desiccation of saplings with shallow roots due to summer drought periods in the top soil layers, causing suppression of forest reproduction ({cite.12.'Hogg_and_Schwarz_1997}); leaf tissue damage due to high leaf temperatures during peak summer temperatures under strong climate warming; and increased insect, herbivory and subsequent fire damage in damaged or struggling stands ({cite.12.'Dulamsuren_et_al_2008}). The balance of effects controlling standing {Glossary.*Biomass biomass}, fire type and frequency, {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} thaw depth, snow volume and soil moisture remains uncertain. Although the existence of, and the thresholds controlling, a potential critical threshold in the boreal forest are extremely uncertain, its existence cannot at present be ruled out.
