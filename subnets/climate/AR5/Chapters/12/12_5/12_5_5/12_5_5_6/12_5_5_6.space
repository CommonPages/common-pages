section 12_5_5_6

  |Analysis suggest that the risk of Amazonian {Glossary.*Forest forest} dieback is small. However, {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} concerning the existence of critical thresholds in the Amazonian and other tropical rainforests remains high, and so the possibility of a critical threshold being crossed in precipitation volume cannot be ruled out. Likewise, although the existence of, and the thresholds controlling, a potential critical threshold in the boreal forest are extremely uncertain, its existence cannot at present be ruled out.
