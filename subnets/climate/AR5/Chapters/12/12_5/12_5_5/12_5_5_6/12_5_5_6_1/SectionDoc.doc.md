title: 12.5.5.6.1 - Tropical forests

In today’s climate, the strongest growth in the Amazon rainforest occurs during the dry season when strong {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} is combined with water drawn from underground aquifers that store the previous wet season’s rainfall ({cite.12.'Huete_et_al_2006}). {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} do not agree about how the dry season length in the Amazon may change in the future under the SRES A1 scenario ({cite.12.'Bombardi_and_Carvalho_2009}), but simulations with coupled {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate}/potential vegetation models are consistent in simulating an increase in dry season length, a 70% reduction in the areal extent of the rainforest by the end of the 21st century using the SRES A2 scenario, and an eastward expansion of the Caatinga vegetation ({cite.12.'Cook_and_Vizy_2008}; {cite.12.'Sorensson_et_al_2010}). In addition, some models have demonstrated the existence of multiple equilibria of the tropical South American climate–vegetation system (e.g., {cite.12.'Oyama_and_Nobre_2003}). The transition could be abrupt when the dry season becomes too long for the vegetation to survive, although the resilience of the vegetation to a longer dry period may be increased by the {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fertilization effect ({cite.12.'Zelazowski_et_al_2011}). {Glossary.*Deforestation Deforestation} may also increase dry season length ({cite.12.'Costa_and_Pires_2010}) and drier conditions increase the {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of wildfires that, combined with fire ignition associated with human activity, can undermine the {Glossary.*Forest forest}’s resiliency to climate change (see also {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_8.6_4_8_1 Section 6.4.8.1}). If climate change brings drier conditions closer to those supportive of seasonal forests rather than rainforest, fire can act as a trigger to abruptly and irreversibly change the {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} ({cite.12.'Malhi_et_al_2009}). However, the existence of refugia is an important determinant of the potential for the re-emergence of the vegetation ({cite.12.'Walker_et_al_2009}).

Analysis of {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} change in the climate–{Glossary.*Biome biome} space of current vegetation distributions suggest that the risk of Amazonian forest dieback is small ({cite.12.'Malhi_et_al_2009}), a finding supported by modelling when strong {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide_fertilization carbon dioxide fertilization} effects on Amazonian vegetation are assumed ({cite.12.'Rammig_et_al_2010}). However, the strength of CO2 fertilization on tropical vegetation is poorly known (see {Box_6_3 Box 6.3}). {Topics.*Uncertainty Uncertainty} concerning the existence of critical thresholds in the Amazonian and other tropical rainforests purely driven by climate change therefore remains high, and so the possibility of a critical threshold being crossed in precipitation volume cannot be ruled out ({cite.12.'Nobre_and_Borma_2009}; {cite.12.'Good_et_al_2011b}, 2011c). Nevertheless, there is still some question as to whether a transition of the Amazonian or other tropical rainforests into a lower {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} state could result from the combined effects of limits to carbon fertilization, climate warming, potential precipitation decline in interaction with the effects of human land use.
