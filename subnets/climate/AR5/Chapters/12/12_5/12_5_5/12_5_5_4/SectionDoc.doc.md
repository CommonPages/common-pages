title: 12.5.5.4 - Permafrost Carbon Storage

Since the IPCC {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, estimates of the amount of carbon stored in {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} have been significantly revised upwards ({cite.12.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}), putting the permafrost carbon {Glossary.*Stock stock} to an equivalent of twice the atmospheric carbon pool ({cite.12.'Dolman_et_al_2010}). Because of low carbon input at high latitudes, permafrost carbon is to a large part of {Glossary.*Pleistocene Pleistocene} ({cite.12.'Zimov_et_al_2006}) or {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} ({cite.12.'Smith_et_al_2004}) origin, and its potential vulnerability is dominated by decomposition ({cite.12.'Eglin_et_al_2010}). The conjunction of a long carbon {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} time scale on one hand and potentially rapid permafrost thawing and carbon decomposition under warmer climatic conditions ({cite.12.'Zimov_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Schuur_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Kuhry_et_al_2010}) on the other hand suggests potential {Glossary.*Irreversibility irreversibility} of permafrost carbon decomposition (leading to an increase of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and/or {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} concentrations) on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years in a warming climate. Indeed, recent observations ({cite.12.'Dorrepaal_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Kuhry_et_al_2010}) suggest that this process, induced by widespread permafrost warming and thawing ({cite.12.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010}), might be already occurring. However, the existing modelling studies of permafrost carbon balance under future warming that take into account at least some of the essential permafrost-related processes ({cite.12.'Khvorostyanov_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Wania_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Koven_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Schaefer_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'MacDougall_et_al_2012}; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2012) do not yield coherent results beyond the fact that present-day permafrost might become a net emitter of carbon during the 21st century under plausible future warming {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} (low confidence). This also reflects an insufficient understanding of the relevant soil processes during and after permafrost thaw, including processes leading to stabilization of unfrozen soil carbon ({cite.12.'Schmidt_et_al_2011}), and precludes a firm assessment of the amplitude of irreversible changes in the climate system potentially related to permafrost degassing and associated global feedbacks at this stage (see also Sections {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_3.6_4_3_4 6.4.3.4} and {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_7.6_4_7_2 6.4.7.2} and {FAQ_6_1 FAQ 6.1}).
