title: 12.5.5.3 - Ice Sheets

As detailed in {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3 Section 13.4.3}, all available modelling studies agree that the Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} will significantly decrease in area and volume in a warmer climate as a consequence of increased melt rates not compensated for by increased snowfall rates and amplified by positive feedbacks. Conversely, the surface mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet is projected to increase in most {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} because increased snowfall rates outweigh melt increase (see {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4 Section 13.4.4}).

{Glossary.*Irreversibility Irreversibility} of ice sheet volume and extent changes can arise because of the surface-elevation {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} that operates when a decrease of the elevation of the ice sheet induces a decreased surface mass balance (generally through increased melting), and therefore essentially applies to Greenland. As detailed in {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_3 Section 13.4.3.3}, several stable states of the Greenland ice sheet might exist ({cite.12.'Charbit_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Ridley_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Langen_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Robinson_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Solgaard_and_Langen_2012}), and the ice sheet might irreversibly shrink to a stable smaller state once a warming threshold is crossed for a certain amount of time, with the critical duration depending on how far the temperature threshold has been exceeded. Based on the available evidence (see {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_3 Section 13.4.3.3}), an irreversible decrease of the Greenland ice sheet due to surface mass balance changes appears very unlikely in the 21st century but likely on multi-centennial to millennial time scales in the strongest {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}.

In theory ({cite.12.'Weertman_1974}; {cite.12.'Schoof_2007}) ice sheet volume and extent changes can be abrupt because of the {Glossary.*Grounding_line grounding line} instability that can occur in coastal regions where bedrock is retrograde (i.e., sloping towards the interior of the ice sheet) and below {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} (see {Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_4 Section 4.4.4} and {Box_13_2 Box 13.2}). This essentially applies to West Antarctica, but also to parts of Greenland and East Antarctica. Furthermore, {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} decay induced by oceanic or atmospheric warming might lead to abruptly accelerated ice flow further inland (De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003). Because ice sheet growth is usually a slow process, such changes could also be irreversible in the definition adopted here. The available evidence (see {Chapters.13.13_4 Section 13.4}) suggests that it is exceptionally unlikely that the ice sheets of either Greenland or West Antarctica will suffer a near-complete disintegration during the 21st century. More generally, the potential for abrupt and/or irreversible ice sheet changes (or the initiation thereof) during the 21st century and beyond is discussed in detail in Sections {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3 13.4.3} and {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4 13.4.4}.
