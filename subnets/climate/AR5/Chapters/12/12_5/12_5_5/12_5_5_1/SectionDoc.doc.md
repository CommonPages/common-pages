title: 12.5.5.1 - Introduction

This report adopts the definition of {Glossary.*Abrupt_climate_change abrupt climate change} used in Synthesis and Assessment Product 3.4 of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program CCSP ({cite.12.'CCSP_2008b}). We define abrupt climate change as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems (see Glossary). Other definitions of abrupt climate change exist. For example, in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} climate change was defined as abrupt if it occurred faster than the typical time scale of the responsible {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}.

A number of components or phenomena within the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} have been proposed as potentially possessing critical thresholds (sometimes referred to as tipping points ({cite.12.'Lenton_et_al_2008})), beyond which abrupt or nonlinear transitions to a different state ensues. The term irreversibility is used in various ways in the literature. The AR5 report defines a perturbed state as irreversible on a given time scale if the recovery time scale from this state due to natural processes is significantly longer than the time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state (see Glossary). In that context, most aspects of the climate change resulting from {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} are irreversible, due to the long residence time of the CO2 perturbation in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and the resulting warming ({cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2009}). These results are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_2 Section 12.5.2} to 12.5.4. Here, we also assess aspects of irreversibility in the context of abrupt change, multiple steady states and hysteresis, i.e., the question whether a change (abrupt or not) would be reversible if the forcing was reversed or removed (e.g., {cite.12.'Boucher_et_al_2012}). {Glossary.*Irreversibility Irreversibility} of ice sheets and {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise are also assessed in {Chapters.13 Chapter 13}.

In this section we examine the main components or phenomena within the Earth system that have been proposed in the literature as potentially being susceptible to abrupt or irreversible change (see {'Table_12_4 Table 12.4}). Abrupt changes that arise from nonlinearities within the climate system are inherently difficult to assess and their timing, if any, of future occurrences is difficult to predict. Nevertheless, progress is being made exploring the potential existence of early warning signs for abrupt climate change (see e.g., {cite.12.'Dakos_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Scheffer_et_al_2009}).
