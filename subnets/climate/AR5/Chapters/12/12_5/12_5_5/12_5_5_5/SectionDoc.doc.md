title: 12.5.5.5 - Atmospheric Methane from Terrestrial and Oceanic Clathrates

Model simulations ({cite.12.'Fyke_and_Weaver_2006}; {cite.12.'Reagan_and_Moridis_2007}; {cite.12.'Lamarque_2008}; {cite.12.'Reagan_and_Moridis_2009}) suggest that {Glossary.*Clathrate_methane clathrate} deposits in shallow regions (in particular at high latitude regions and in the Gulf of Mexico) are susceptible to destabilization via ocean warming. However, concomitant {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise due to changes in ocean mass enhances clathrate stability in the ocean ({cite.12.'Fyke_and_Weaver_2006}). A recent assessment of the potential for a future abrupt release of methane was undertaken by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (Synthesis and Assessment Product 3.4 see {cite.12.'Brooke_et_al_2008}). They concluded that it was very unlikely that such a catastrophic release would occur this century. However, they argued that {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} warming will very likely lead to enhanced methane {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from both terrestrial and oceanic clathrates ({cite.12.'Brooke_et_al_2008}). Although difficult to formally assess, initial estimates of the 21st century positive {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} from methane clathrate destabilization are small but not insignificant ({cite.12.'Fyke_and_Weaver_2006}; {cite.12.'Archer_2007}; {cite.12.'Lamarque_2008}). Nevertheless, on multi-millennial time scales, the positive feedback to anthropogenic warming of such methane emissions is potentially larger ({cite.12.'Archer_and_Buffett_2005}; {cite.12.'Archer_2007}; {cite.12.'Brooke_et_al_2008}). Once more, due to the difference between release and {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} time scales, such emissions are irreversible. See also {FAQ_6_1 FAQ 6.1}.
