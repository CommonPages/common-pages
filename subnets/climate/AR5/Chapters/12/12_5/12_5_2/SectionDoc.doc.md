title: 12.5.2 - Climate Change Commitment

{Glossary.*Climate_change_commitment Climate change commitment}, the fact that the climate will change further after the forcing or {Topics.*Emissions emissions} have been eliminated or held constant, has attracted increased attention by scientists and policymakers shortly before the completion of IPCC {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2005a}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2005b}, 2006; {cite.12.'Wigley_2005}) (see also AR4 {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_1 Section 10.7.1}). However, the argument that the surface response would lag the RF due to the large thermal {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir} of the ocean in fact goes back much longer ({cite.12.'Bryan_et_al_1982}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_1984}, 1985; {cite.12.'Siegenthaler_and_Oeschger_1984}; {cite.12.'Schlesinger_1986}; {cite.12.'Mitchell_et_al_2000}; {cite.12.'Wetherald_et_al_2001}). The discussion in this section is framed largely in terms of temperature change, but other changes in the climate system (e.g., precipitation) are closely related to changes in temperature (see Sections {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_1.12_4_1_1 12.4.1.1} and {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_2 12.4.2}). A summary of how past emissions relate to future warming is also given in {FAQ_12_3 FAQ 12.3}.

The {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} has multiple {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} scales related to different thermal reservoirs (see also {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}). For a step change in forcing (instantaneous increase in the magnitude of the forcing and constant forcing after that), a large fraction of the total of the {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} response will be realized within years to a few decades ({cite.12.'Brasseur_and_Roeckner_2005}; {cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2008a}; {cite.12.'Murphy_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2011}). The remaining response, realized over centuries, is controlled by the slow mixing of the energy perturbation into the ocean ({cite.12.'Stouffer_2004}). The {Glossary.*Response_time response time} scale depends on the amount of ocean mixing and the strength of climate feedbacks, and is longer for higher {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_1985}; {cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2005}). The transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} is therefore smaller than the equilibrium response, in particular for high climate sensitivities. This can also be interpreted as the ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} being a negative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({cite.12.'Dufresne_and_Bony_2008}; {cite.12.'Gregory_and_Forster_2008}). Delayed responses can also occur due to processes other than ocean warming, for example, vegetation change ({cite.12.'Jones_et_al_2009}) or {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} melt that continues long after the forcing has been stabilized (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}).

Several forms of commitment are often discussed in the literature. The most common is the ‘constant composition commitment’, the warming that would occur after stabilizing all radiative constituents at a given year (for example year 2000) levels. For year 2000 commitment, {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} estimated a most likely value of about 0.6°C for 2100 (relative to 1980–1999, AR4 {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_1 Section 10.7.1}). A present-day composition commitment simulation is not part of CMIP5, so direct comparison with CMIP3 is not possible. However, the available CMIP5 results based on the RCP4.5 extension with constant RF (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_1 Section 12.5.1}) are consistent with those numbers, with an additional warming of about 0.5°C 200 years after stabilization of the forcing (Figures {'Figure_12_5 12.5} and {'Figure_12_42 12.42}).

A measure of constant composition commitment is the fraction of realized warming which can be estimated as the ratio of the warming at a given time to the long-term equilibrium warming (e.g., {cite.12.'Stouffer_2004}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}, {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_2 Section 10.7.2}; {cite.12.'Eby_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2009}). EMIC simulations have been performed with {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} forcing up to 2300 prolonged until the end of the millennium with a constant forcing set at the value reached by 2300 ({'Figure_12_43 Figure 12.43}). When the forcing stabilizes, the fraction of realized warming is significantly below unity. However, the fraction of realized warming depends on the history of the forcing. For the {Glossary.*RCP4_5_and_RCP6_0 RCP4.5 and RCP6.0} extension {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} with early stabilization, it is about 75% at the time of forcing stabilization; while for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}, with stabilization occurring later, it is about 85% (see {'Figure_12_43 Figure 12.43}); but for a 1% yr–1 {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increase to 2 × CO2 or 4 × CO2 and constant forcing thereafter, the fraction of realized warming is much smaller, about 40 to 70% at the time when the forcing is kept constant. The fraction of realized warming rises typically by 10% over the century following the stabilization of forcing. Due to the long time scales in the deep ocean, full equilibrium is reached only after hundreds to thousands of years ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_1985}; {cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Stouffer_2004}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}, {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_2 Section 10.7.2}; {cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2008a}; {cite.12.'Danabasoglu_and_Gent_2009}; {cite.12.'Held_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2013a}).

‘Constant emission commitment’ is the warming that would result from maintaining annual {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions at the current level. Few studies exist but it is estimated to be about 1°C to 2.5°C by 2100 assuming constant (year 2010) emissions in the future, based on the MAGICC model calibrated to CMIP3 and C4MIP models ({cite.12.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011a}; {cite.12.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011b}) (see {FAQ_12_3 FAQ 12.3}). Such a scenario is different from non-intervention economic scenarios, and it does not stabilize global temperature, as any plausible emission path after 2100 would cause further warming. It is also different from a constant cumulative {Glossary.*Emission_scenario emission scenario} which implies zero emissions in the future.

Another form of commitment involves climate change when anthropogenic emissions are set to zero (‘zero emission commitment’). Results from a variety of models ranging from {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.12.'Weaver_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2008}; {cite.12.'Plattner_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Eby_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2011}) to {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} (Frölicher and Joos, 2010; {cite.12.'Gillett_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Gillett_et_al_2013}) show that abruptly setting CO2 emissions to zero (keeping other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} constant if accounted for) results in approximately constant global temperature for several centuries onward. Those results indicate that past emissions commit us to persistent warming for hundreds of years, continuing at about the level of warming that has been realized. On near equilibrium time scales of a few centuries to about a millennium, the temperature response to CO2 emissions is controlled by climate sensitivity (see {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}) and the cumulative {Glossary.*Airborne_fraction airborne fraction} of CO2 over these time scales. After about a thousand years (i.e., near thermal equilibrium) and cumulative CO2 emissions less than about 2000 PgC, approximately 20 to 30% of the cumulative anthropogenic carbon emissions still remain in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} ({cite.12.'Montenegro_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Plattner_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Archer_et_al_2009}; Frölicher and Joos, 2010; {cite.12.'Joos_et_al_2013}) (see {Box_6_1 Box 6.1}) and maintain a substantial temperature response long after emissions have ceased ({cite.12.'Friedlingstein_and_Solomon_2005}; {cite.12.'Hare_and_Meinshausen_2006}; {cite.12.'Weaver_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2008}; {cite.12.'Plattner_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Eby_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Lowe_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2009}, 2010; Frölicher and Joos, 2010; {cite.12.'Zickfeld_et_al_2012}). In the transient phase, on a 100to 1000-year time scale, the approximately constant temperature results from a compensation between delayed commitment warming ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2005b}; {cite.12.'Wigley_2005}) and the reduction in atmospheric CO2 resulting from ocean and land carbon uptake as well as from the nonlinear dependence of RF on atmospheric CO2 ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.12.'Plattner_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2010}). The commitment associated with past emissions depends, as mentioned above, on the value of climate sensitivity and cumulative CO2 airborne fraction, but it also depends on the choices made for other RF constituents. In a CO2 only case and for equilibrium climate sensitivities near 3°C, the warming commitment (i.e., the warming relative to the time when emissions are stopped) is near zero or slightly negative. For high climate sensitivities, and in particular if {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} emissions are eliminated at the same time, the commitment from past emission can be significantly positive, and is a superposition of a fast response to reduced aerosols emissions and a slow response associated with high climate sensitivities ({cite.12.'Brasseur_and_Roeckner_2005}; {cite.12.'Hare_and_Meinshausen_2006}; {cite.12.'Armour_and_Roe_2011}; {cite.12.'Knutti_and_Plattner_2012}; {cite.12.'Matthews_and_Zickfeld_2012}) (see {FAQ_12_3 FAQ 12.3}). In the real world, the emissions of CO2 and non-CO2 forcing agents are of course coupled. All of the above studies support the conclusion that temperatures would decrease only very slowly (if at all), even for strong reductions or complete elimination of CO2 emissions, and might even increase temporarily for an abrupt reduction of the short-lived aerosols ({FAQ_12_3 FAQ 12.3}). The implications of this fact for climate stabilization are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_4 Section 12.5.4}.

New EMIC simulations with pre-industrial CO2 emissions and zero non-CO2 forcings after 2300 ({cite.12.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}) confirm this behaviour ({'Figure_12_44 Figure 12.44}) seen in many earlier studies (see above). Switching off anthropogenic CO2 emissions in 2300 leads to a continuous slow decline of atmospheric CO2, to a significantly slower decline of global temperature and to a continuous increase in ocean {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} over the course of the millennium. Larger forcings induce longer delays before the Earth system would reach equilibrium. For RCP8.5, by year 3000 (700 years after emissions have ceased) global temperature has decreased only by 1°C to 2°C (relative to its peak value by 2300) and ocean thermal expansion has almost doubled (relative to 2300) and is still increasing ({cite.12.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}).

The previous paragraph discussed climate change commitment from {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} that have already been emitted. Another form of commitment refers to climate change associated with heat and carbon that has gone into the land surface and oceans. This would be relevant to the consequences of a one-time removal of all of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere and is computed by taking a transient simulation and instantaneously setting atmospheric CO2 concentrations to initial (pre-industrial) values ({cite.12.'Cao_and_Caldeira_2010}). In such an extreme case, there would be a net flux of CO2 from the ocean and land surface to the atmosphere, releasing an amount of CO2 representing about 30% of what was removed from the atmosphere, i.e., the airborne fraction applies equally to positive and negative emissions, and it depends on the emissions history. A related form of experiment investigates the consequences of an initial complete removal followed by sustained removal of any CO2 returned to the atmosphere from the land surface and oceans, and is computed by setting atmospheric CO2 concentrations to pre-industrial values and maintaining this concentration ({cite.12.'Cao_and_Caldeira_2010}). In this case, only about one-tenth of the pre-existing temperature perturbation persists for more than half of a century. A similar study performed with a GFDL AOGCM where forcing was instantaneously returned to its pre-industrial value, found larger residual warming, up to 30% of the pre-existing warming ({cite.12.'Held_et_al_2010}).

Several studies on commitment to past emissions have demonstrated that the persistence of warming is substantially longer than the {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of anthropogenic GHGs themselves, as a result of nonlinear absorption effects as well as the slow heat transfer into and out of the ocean. In much the same way as the warming to a step increase of forcing is delayed, the cooling after setting RF to zero is also delayed. Loss of excess heat from the ocean will lead to a positive surface air temperature anomaly for decades to centuries ({cite.12.'Held_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bouttes_et_al_2013}).

A more general form of commitment is the question of how much warming we are committed to as a result of inertia and hence commitments related to the time scales for energy system transitions and other societal, economic and technological aspects ({cite.12.'Grubb_1997}; {cite.12.'Washington_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Davis_et_al_2010}). For example, {cite.12.'Davis_et_al_2010 Davis et al. (2010)} estimated climate commitment of 1.3°C (range 1.1°C to 1.4°C, relative to pre-industrial) from existing CO2-emitting devices under specific assumptions regarding their lifetimes. These forms of commitment, however, are strongly based on political, economic and social assumptions that are outside the domain of IPCC WGI and are not further considered here.
