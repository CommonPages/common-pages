title: 12.4.8.2 - Changes in Vegetation Cover

Vegetation cover can also be affected by climate change, with {Glossary.*Forest forest} cover potentially being decreasing (e.g., in the tropics) or increasing (e.g., in high latitudes). In particular, the Amazon forest has been the subject of several studies, generally agreeing that future climate change would increase the risk tropical Amazon forest being replaced by seasonal forest or even savannah ({cite.12.'Huntingford_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Jones_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Malhi_et_al_2009}). Increase in atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} would partly reduce such risk, through increase in water efficiency under elevated CO2 ({cite.12.'Lapola_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Malhi_et_al_2009}). Recent multi-model estimates based on different CMIP3 {Topics.*Scenarios climate scenarios} and different dynamic global vegetation models predict a moderate risk of tropical forest reduction in South America and even lower risk for African and Asian tropical forests (see also {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_6 Section 12.5.5.6}) ({cite.12.'Gumpenberger_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Huntingford_et_al_2013}).

{Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} simulations with interactive vegetation confirmed known biophysical {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} associated with large-scale changes in vegetation. In the northern high latitudes, warming-induced vegetation expansion reduces surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}, enhancing the warming over these regions ({cite.12.'Falloon_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Port_et_al_2012}), with potentially larger amplification due to ocean and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} response ({cite.12.'Swann_et_al_2010}). Over tropical forest, reduction of forest coverage would reduce {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration}, also leading to a regional warming ({cite.12.'Falloon_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Port_et_al_2012}).

CMIP5 ESMs also include human induced land cover changes ({Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation}, {Glossary.*Reforestation reforestation}) affecting the climate system through changes in land surface physical properties ({cite.12.'Hurtt_et_al_2011}). Future changes in land cover will have an impact on the climate system through biophysical and biogeochemical processes (e.g., {cite.12.'Pongratz_et_al_2010}). Biophysical processes include changes in surface albedo and changes in partitioning between latent and sensible heat, while biogeochemical feedbacks essentially include change in CO2 sources and sinks but could potentially also include changes in {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} or {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} {Topics.*Emissions emissions}. The biophysical response to future land cover changes has been investigated within the {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios}. Using the SRES A2 2100 land cover, {cite.12.'Davin_et_al_2007 Davin et al. (2007)} simulated a global cooling of 0.14 K relatively to a simulation with present-day land cover, the cooling being largely driven by change in albedo. Regional analyses have been performed in order to quantify the biophysical impact of biofuels plantation generally finding a local to regional cooling when annual crops are replaced by bioenergy crops, such as sugar cane ({cite.12.'Georgescu_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Loarie_et_al_2011}). However, some energy crops require nitrogen inputs for their production, leading inevitably to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, potentially reducing the direct cooling effect and the benefit of biofuels as an alternative to {Glossary.*Fossil_fuel_emissions fossil fuel emissions}. Such emission estimates are still uncertain, varying strongly for different crops, management methods, soil types and reference systems (St. Clair et al., 2008; {cite.12.'Smeets_et_al_2009}).

In the context of the Land-Use and Climate, IDentification of robust impacts (LUCID) project ({cite.12.'Pitman_et_al_2009}) ESMs performed additional CMIP5 simulations in order to separate the biophysical from the biogeochemical effects of land use changes in the RCP scenarios. The LUCID–CMIP5 experiments were designed to complement {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} and {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} simulations of CMIP5, both of which showing an intensification of {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} over the 21st century. The LUCID–CMIP5 analysis was focussed on a difference in climate and land-{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} fluxes between the average of {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of simulations with and without land use changes by the end of 21st century ({cite.12.'Brovkin_et_al_2013}). Due to different interpretation of land use classes, areas of crops and pastures were specific for each ESM ({'Figure_12_38 Figure 12.38}, left). On the global scale, simulated biophysical effects of land use changes {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} in the CMIP5 experiments with prescribed CO2 concentrations were not significant. However, these effects were significant for regions with land use changes >10%. Only three out of six participating models, CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-ESM, reveal statistically significant changes in regional mean annual mean surface air temperature for the RCP8.5 scenario ({'Figure_12_38 Figure 12.38}, right). However, there is low confidence on the overall effect as there is no agreement among the models on the sign of the global average temperature change due to the biophysical effects of land use changes ({cite.12.'Brovkin_et_al_2013}). Changes in land surface albedo, available energy, latent and sensible heat fluxes were relatively small but significant in most of ESMs for regions with substantial land use changes. The scale of climatic effects reflects a small magnitude of land use changes in both the RCP2.6 and 8.5 scenarios and their limitation mainly to the tropical and subtropical regions where differences between biophysical effects of forests and grasslands are less pronounced than in midand high latitudes. LUCIDCMIP5 did not perform similar simulations for the RCP4.5 or RCP6.0 scenarios. As these two scenarios show a global decrease of land use area, one might expect their climatic impact to be different from the one seen in the RC2.6 and RCP8.5.
