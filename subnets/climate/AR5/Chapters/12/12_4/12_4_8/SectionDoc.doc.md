title: 12.4.8 - Changes Associated with Carbon Cycle Feedbacks and Vegetation Cover

Climate change may affect the global biogeochemical cycles changing the magnitude of the natural sources and sinks of major {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}. Numerous studies investigated the interactions between climate change and the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} (e.g., {cite.12.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006}), methane cycle (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2010), {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({cite.12.'Cionni_et_al_2011}) or aerosols (e.g., {cite.12.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}). Many CMIP5 {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} now include a representation of the carbon cycle as well as atmospheric chemistry, allowing interactive {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of GHGs (mainly {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and O3) and aerosols. With such models, projections account for the imposed changes in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, but also for changes in natural sources and sinks as they respond to changes in climate and atmospheric composition. If included in ESMs, the impact on projected concentration, {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} and hence on climate can be quantified. Climate-induced changes on the carbon cycle are assessed below, while changes in natural emissions of {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} are assessed in {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}, changes in atmospheric chemistry in {Chapters.11 Chapter 11}, and climate–{Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} interactions are assessed in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}.
