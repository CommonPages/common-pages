title: 12.4.1.1 - Projected Changes in Global Mean Temperature and Precipitation

A consistent and robust feature across {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} is a continuation of global warming in the 21st century for all the RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} ({'Figure_12_5 Figure 12.5} showing changes in concentration-driven model simulations). Temperature increases are almost the same for all the RCP scenarios during the first two decades after 2005 (see {'Figure_11_25 Figure 11.25}). At longer time scales, the warming rate begins to depend more on the specified GHG concentration pathway, being highest (>0.3°C per decade) in the highest {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} and significantly lower in {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, particularly after about 2050 when global {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} response stabilizes (and declines thereafter). The dependence of global temperature rise on GHG forcing at longer time scales has been confirmed by several studies ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}). In the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean, global warming under RCP2.6 stays below 2°C above 1850-1900 levels throughout the 21st century, clearly demonstrating the potential of {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} policies (note that to translate the anomalies in {'Figure_12_5 Figure 12.5} into anomalies with respect to that period, an assumed 0.61°C of observed warming since 1850–1900, as discussed in {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_3 Section 2.4.3}, should be added). This is in agreement with previous studies of aggressive mitigation scenarios ({cite.12.'Johns_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2012}). Note, however, that some individual ensemble members do show warming exceeding 2°C above 1850-1900 (see {'Table_12_3 Table 12.3}). As for the other pathways, global warming exceeds 2°C within the 21st century under RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, in qualitative agreement with previous studies using the SRES A1B and A2 scenarios ({cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2011}). Global mean temperature increase exceeds 4°C under RCP8.5 by 2100. The CMIP5 concentration-driven global temperature {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} are broadly similar to CMIP3 {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} discussed in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}) and {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_9 Section 12.4.9}, although the overall range of the former is larger primarily because of the low-emission mitigation pathway RCP2.6 (Knutti and Sedláček, 2013).

The multi-model global mean temperature changes under different {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} are summarized in {'Table_12_2 Table 12.2}. The relationship between cumulative {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} carbon {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and global temperature is assessed in {Chapters.12.12_5 Section 12.5} and only concentration-driven models are included here. Warming in 2046–2065 is slightly larger under RCP4.5 compared to RCP6.0, consistent with its greater total anthropogenic forcing at that time (see Table A.II.6.12). For all other periods the magnitude of global temperature change increases from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5. Beyond 2100, RCP2.6 shows a decreasing {Glossary.*Trend trend} whereas under all other RCPs warming continues to increase. Also shown in {'Table_12_2 Table 12.2} are projected changes at 2081–2100 averaged over land and ocean separately as well as area-weighted averages over the Tropics (30°S to 30°N), Arctic (67.5°N to 90°N) and Antarctic (90°S to 55°S) regions. Surface air temperatures over land warm more than over the ocean, and northern polar regions warm more than the tropics. The excess of land mass in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in comparison with the Southern Hemisphere (SH), coupled with the greater {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of heat by the Southern Ocean in comparison with northern ocean basins means that the NH generally warms more than the SH. Arctic warming is much greater than in the Antarctic, due to the presence of the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} and differences in local responses in snow and ice. Mechanisms behind these features of warming are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3 Section 12.4.3}. Maps and time series of regional temperature changes are displayed in Annex I and regional averages are discussed in {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_1 Section 14.8.1}.

{table:'Table_12_2}

Global annual multi-model mean temperature changes above 1850–1900 are listed in {'Table_12_3 Table 12.3} for the 2081–2100 period (assuming 0.61°C warming since 1850–1900 as discussed in {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_3 Section 2.4.3}) along with the percentage of 2081–2100 projections from the CMIP5 models exceeding policy-relevant temperature levels under each RCP. These complement a similar discussion for the near-term projections in {'Table_11_3 Table 11.3} which are based on the CMIP5 ensemble as well as evidence (discussed in Sections {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1 10.3.1}, {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_1.11_3_2_1_1 11.3.2.1.1} and {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_3 11.3.6.3}) that some CMIP5 models have a higher sensitivity to {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and a larger response to other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} (dominated by the effects of aerosols) than the real world (medium confidence). The percentage calculations for the long-term projections in {'Table_12_3 Table 12.3} are based solely on the CMIP5 ensemble, using one ensemble member for each model. For these long-term projections, the 5 to 95% ranges of the CMIP5 model ensemble are considered the likely range, an assessment based on the fact that the 5 to 95% range of CMIP5 models’ TCR coincides with the assessed likely range of the TCR (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_1.12_4_1_2 Section 12.4.1.2} below and {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}). Based on this assessment, global mean temperatures averaged in the period 2081–2100 are projected to likely exceed 1.5°C above 1850-1900 for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). They are also likely to exceed 2°C above 1850-1900 for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence) and more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (medium confidence). Temperature change above 2°C under RCP2.6 is unlikely but is assessed only with medium confidence as some CMIP5 ensemble members do produce a global mean temperature change above 2°C. Warming above 4°C by 2081– 2100 is unlikely in all RCPs (high confidence) except RCP8.5. Under the latter, the 4°C global temperature level is exceeded in more than half of ensemble members, and is assessed to be about as likely as not (medium confidence). Note that the likelihoods of exceeding specific temperature levels show some sensitivity to the choice of reference period (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_3 Section 11.3.6.3}).

CMIP5 models on average project a gradual increase in global precipitation over the 21st century: change exceeds 0.05 mm day–1 (~2% of global precipitation) and 0.15 mm day–1 (~5% of global precipitation) by 2100 in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. The relationship between global precipitation and global temperature is approximately linear ({'Figure_12_6 Figure 12.6}). The precipitation sensitivity, that is, the change of global precipitation with temperature, is about 1 to 3% °C–1 in most models, tending to be highest for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 ({'Figure_12_7 Figure 12.7}; note that only global values are discussed in this section, ocean and land changes are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5.12_4_5_2 Section 12.4.5.2}). These behaviours are consistent with previous studies, including CMIP3 model projections for SRES scenarios and AR4 constant composition commitment experiments ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}), and ENSEMBLES multi-model results for SRES A1B and E1 scenarios ({cite.12.'Johns_et_al_2011}).

The processes that govern global precipitation changes are now well understood and have been presented in {Chapters.7.7_6 Section 7.6}. They are briefly summarized here and used to interpret the long-term projected changes. The precipitation sensitivity (about 1 to 3% °C–1) is very different from the water vapour sensitivity (~7% °C–1) as the main physical laws that drive these changes also differ. Water vapour increases are primarily a consequence of the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausius–Clapeyron} relationship associated with increasing temperatures in the lower {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} (where most atmospheric water vapour resides). In contrast, future precipitation changes are primarily the result of changes in the {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and the way that these later interact with circulation, moisture and temperature ({cite.12.'Mitchell_et_al_1987}; {cite.12.'Boer_1993}; {cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.12.'Previdi_2010}; O’Gorman et al., 2012). Indeed, the radiative cooling of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} is balanced by latent heating (associated with precipitation) and sensible heating. Since AR4, the changes in heat balance and their effects on precipitation have been analyzed in detail for a large variety of forcings, simulations and models ({cite.12.'Takahashi_2009a}; {cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bala_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Ming_et_al_2010}; O’Gorman et al., 2012; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}).

An increase of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} decreases the radiative cooling of the troposphere and reduces precipitation ({cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bala_et_al_2010}). On longer time scales than the fast hydrological adjustment time scale ({cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bala_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Cao_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}), the increase of CO2 induces a slow increase of temperature and water vapour, thereby enhancing the radiative cooling of the atmosphere and increasing global precipitation ({cite.12.'Allen_and_Ingram_2002}; {cite.12.'Yang_et_al_2003}; {cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). Even after the CO2 forcing stabilizes or begins to decrease, the ocean continues to warm, which then drives up global temperature, evaporation and precipitation. In addition, nonlinear effects also affect precipitation changes ({cite.12.'Good_et_al_2012}). These different effects explain the steepening of the precipitation versus temperature relationship in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios ({'Figure_12_6 Figure 12.6}), as RF stabilizes and/or declines from the mid-century ({'Figure_12_4 Figure 12.4}). In idealized CO2 ramp-up/ramp-down experiments, this effect produces an hydrological response overshoot ({cite.12.'Wu_et_al_2010}). An increase of absorbing aerosols warms the atmosphere and reduces precipitation, and the {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} response may be too small to compensate this decrease ({cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Ming_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Shiogama_et_al_2010a}). Change in scattering aerosols or incoming {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} modifies global precipitation mainly via the response of the surface temperature ({cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Bala_et_al_2010}).

The main reasons for the inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} of the precipitation sensitivity estimate among {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} have not been fully understood. Nevertheless, spread in the changes of the cloud {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} has been shown to have an impact ({cite.12.'Previdi_2010}), although the effect is less important for precipitation than it is for the {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} estimate ({cite.12.'Lambert_and_Webb_2008}). The {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} plus water vapour {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} and the response of the surface heat flux ({cite.12.'Previdi_2010}; O’Gorman et al., 2012), the shortwave absorption by water vapour ({cite.12.'Takahashi_2009b}) or by aerosols, have been also identified as important factors.

Global precipitation sensitivity estimates from observations are very sensitive to the data and the time period considered. Some observational studies suggest precipitation sensitivity values higher than model estimates ({cite.12.'Wentz_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Zhang_et_al_2007}), although more recent studies suggest consistent values ({cite.12.'Adler_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2011b}).
