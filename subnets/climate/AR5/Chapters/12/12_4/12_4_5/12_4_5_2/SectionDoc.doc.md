title: 12.4.5.2 - Patterns of Projected Average Precipitation Changes

Global mean precipitation changes have been presented in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_1.12_4_1_1 Section 12.4.1.1}. The processes that govern large-scale changes in precipitation are presented in {Chapters.7.7_6 Section 7.6}, and are used here to interpret the projected changes in RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. Changes in precipitation extremes are presented in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5.12_4_5_5 Section 12.4.5.5}. Further discussion of regional changes, in particular the {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} systems, is presented in {Chapters.14 Chapter 14}.

{'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22} shows the CMIP5 multi-model average percentage change in seasonal mean precipitation in the middle of the 21st century, at the end of the 21st century and at the end of the 22nd century for the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario relative to the 1986–2005 average. Precipitation changes for all the scenarios are shown in Annex I Supplementary Material and scale approximately with the global mean temperature ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_2 Section 12.4.2}). In many regions, changes in precipitation exhibit strong seasonal characteristics so that, in regions where the sign of the precipitation changes varies with the season, the annual mean values ({'Figure_12_10 Figure 12.10}) may hide some of these seasonal changes, resulting in weaker confidence than seasonal mean values ({cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2013}; {cite.12.'Huang_et_al_2013}).

The patterns of multi-model precipitation changes displayed in {'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22} tend to smooth and decrease the spatial contrast of precipitation changes simulated by each model, in particular over regions where model results disagree. Thus the amplitude of the multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean precipitation response significantly underestimates the median amplitude computed from each individual model ({cite.12.'Neelin_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2010a}). The CMIP3/5 multi-model ensemble precipitation {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} must be interpreted in the context of uncertainty. Multi-model projections are not probabilistic statements about the {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of changes. Maps of multi-model projected changes are smoothly varying but observed changes are and will continue to be much more granular.

To analyze the patterns of projected precipitation changes, a useful framework consists in decomposing them into a part that is related to atmospheric circulation changes and a part that is related mostly to water vapour changes, referred to as dynamical and thermodynamical components, respectively. However, the definition of these two components may differ among studies. At the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the robust changes of the difference between precipitation and evaporation (P – E) were interpreted as a wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier type of response ({cite.12.'Mitchell_et_al_1987}; {cite.12.'Chou_and_Neelin_2004}; {cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). The theoretical background, which is more relevant over oceans than over land, is that the lower-tropospheric water vapour increase with temperature enhances the moisture transported by the circulation. This leads to additional moisture convergence within the convergence zones and to additional moisture divergence in the descent zones, increasing the contrast in precipitation minus evaporation values between moisture convergence and divergence regions. A weakening of the tropical overturning circulation (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4.12_4_4_2 Section 12.4.4.2}) partially opposes this thermodynamic response ({cite.12.'Chou_and_Neelin_2004}; {cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Allan_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). At the regional scale the dynamic response may be larger than the thermodynamic response, and this has been analyzed in more detail since the AR4 ({cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Xie_et_al_2010}; Muller and O’Gorman, 2011; {cite.12.'Chadwick_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Scheff_and_Frierson_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}; {cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). Over continents, this simple wetget-wetter and dry-get-drier type of response fails for some important regions such as the Amazon. At the global scale, the net water vapour transport from oceans to land increases, and therefore the average P – E over continents also increases ({cite.12.'Liepert_and_Previdi_2012}).

In the mid and high latitudes, a common feature across generations of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} is a simulated increased precipitation. The thermodynamical component explains most of the projected increase ({cite.12.'Emori_and_Brown_2005}; {cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}). This is consistent with theoretical explanations assuming fixed atmospheric flow patterns but increased water vapour in the lower {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). In addition to this thermodynamical effect, water transport may be modified by the poleward shift of the {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} and by the increase of their intensity ({cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Wu_et_al_2011b}), although confidence in such changes in storm tracks may not be high (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4 Section 12.4.4}). On seasonal time scales, the minimum and maximum values of precipitation both increase, with a larger increase of the maximum and therefore an increase of the annual precipitation range ({cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Chou_and_Lan_2012}). In particular, the largest changes over northern Eurasia and North America are projected to occur during winter. At high latitudes of the NH, the precipitation increase may lead to an increase of snowfall in the colder regions and a decrease of snowfall in the warmer regions due to the decreased number of freezing days (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_2 Section 12.4.6.2}).

Most models simulate a large increase of the annual mean precipitation over the equatorial ocean and an equatorward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}), in both summer and winter seasons, that are mainly explained by atmospheric circulation changes ({cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Sobel_and_Camargo_2011}). The changes of the atmospheric circulation have different origins. Along the margins of the {Glossary.*Convection convection} zones, spatial inhomogeneities, including local convergence {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} or the rate at which air masses from dry regions tend to flow into the convection zone, can yield a considerable sensitivity in precipitation response ({cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Neelin_et_al_2006}). Along the equator, {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean interactions yield to a maximum of {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} warming and a large precipitation increase there ({cite.12.'Xie_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). Model studies with idealized configurations suggest that tropical precipitation changes should be interpreted as responses to changes of the atmospheric {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} rather than responses to changes of SST ({cite.12.'Kang_and_Held_2012}). All of these atmospheric circulation changes, and therefore precipitation changes, can differ considerably from model to model. This is the case over both ocean and land. For instance, the spread of model projections in the Sahel {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, West Africa, is large in both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model data base ({cite.12.'Roehrig_et_al_2013}).

In the subtropical dry regions, there is a robust decrease of P – E that is accounted for by the thermodynamic contribution ({cite.12.'Chou_and_Neelin_2004}; {cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). Over ocean, the spatial heterogeneity of temperature increase impacts the lower-tropospheric water vapour increase, which impacts both the thermodynamic and the dynamic responses ({cite.12.'Xie_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). In addition, the pattern of precipitation changes in dry regions may be different from that of P – E because the contribution of evaporation changes can be as large (but of opposite sign) as the moisture transport changes ({cite.12.'Chou_and_Lan_2012}; {cite.12.'Scheff_and_Frierson_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). This is especially the case over the subsidence regions during the warm season over land where the agreement between models is the smallest ({cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Allan_2012}). A robust feature is the decline of precipitation on the poleward flanks of the subtropical dry zones as a consequence of the Hadley Cell expansion, with possible additional decrease from a poleward shift of the mid latitude storm tracks ({cite.12.'Seager_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Scheff_and_Frierson_2012}). On seasonal time scales, the minimum and the maximum values of precipitation both increase, with a larger increase of the maximum and therefore an increase of the annual precipitation range ({cite.12.'Sobel_and_Camargo_2011}; {cite.12.'Chou_and_Lan_2012}).

Long-term precipitation changes are driven mainly by the increase of the {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature}, as presented above, but other factors also contribute to them. Recent studies suggest that {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increase has a significant direct influence on atmospheric circulation, and therefore on global and tropical precipitation changes ({cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bala_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Cao_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). Over the ocean, the positive RF from increased atmospheric CO2 reduces the radiative cooling of the troposphere and the large scale rising motion and hence reduces precipitation in the convective regions. Over large landmasses, the direct effect of CO2 on precipitation is the opposite owing to the small thermal inertia of land surfaces ({cite.12.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Bala_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Cao_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). Regional precipitation changes are also influenced by {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} and {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({cite.12.'Ramanathan_et_al_2001}; {cite.12.'Allen_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Shindell_et_al_2013a}) through both local and large-scale processes, including changes in the circulation. Stratospheric ozone depletion contributes to the poleward expansion of the Hadley Cell and the related change of precipitation in the SH ({cite.12.'Kang_et_al_2011}) whereas {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon} and tropospheric ozone increases are major contributors in the NH ({cite.12.'Allen_et_al_2012}). Regional precipitation changes depend on regional {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} and on how models simulate their local and remote effects. Based on CMIP3 results, the inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} of the estimate of precipitation changes over land is larger than the inter-scenario spread except in East Asia ({cite.12.'Frieler_et_al_2012}).

Projected precipitation changes vary greatly between models, much more so than for temperature projections. Part of this variance is due to genuine differences between the models including their ability to replicate observed precipitation patterns (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_1 Section 9.4.1.1}). However, a large part of it is also the result of the small ensemble size from each model ({cite.12.'Rowell_2012}). This is especially true for regions of small projected changes located between two regions: one experiencing significant increases while the other experiences significant decreases. Individual climate model realizations will differ in their {Glossary.*Projection projection} of future precipitation changes in these regions simply owing to their {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} ({cite.12.'Deser_et_al_2012b}; {cite.12.'Deser_et_al_2012a}). Multi-model projections containing large numbers of realizations would tend to feature small changes in these regions, and hatching in {'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22} indicates regions where the projected multi-model mean change is less than one standard deviation of internal variability (method (a), {Box_12_1 Box 12.1}). Confidence in projections in regions of limited or no change in precipitation may be more difficult to obtain than confidence in regions of large projected changes. However, {cite.12.'Power_et_al_2012 Power et al. (2012)} and {cite.12.'Tebaldi_et_al_2011 Tebaldi et al. (2011)} show that for some of the regions featuring small multi-model average projected changes, effective consensus in projections may be better than the metrics reported in AR4 would imply.

Since the AR4, progress has been made in the understanding of the processes that control large scale precipitation changes. There is high confidence that the contrast of seasonal mean precipitation between dry and wet regions will increase in a warmer climate over most of the globe although there may be regional exceptions to this general pattern. This response is particularly robust when considering P – E changes as a function of atmospheric dynamical regimes. However, it is important to note that significant exceptions can occur in specific regions especially along the equator and on the poleward edges of the subtropical dry zone. In these regions, atmospheric circulation changes lead to shifts of the precipitation patterns. There is high confidence that the contrast between wet and dry seasons will increase over most of the globe as temperatures increase. Over the midand high-latitude regions, projected precipitation increases in winter are larger than in summer. Over most of the subtropical oceans, projected precipitation increases in summer are larger than in winter.

The changes in precipitation shown in {'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22} exhibit patterns that become more pronounced and confidence in them increases as temperatures increase. More generally, the spatial and temporal changes in precipitation between two scenarios or within two periods of a given scenario exhibit the pattern scaling behavior and limitations described in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_2 Section 12.4.2}. The patterns and the associated multi-model spreads in CMIP5 for the RCP scenarios are very similar to those in CMIP3 for the {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} discussed in the AR4, with the projections in CMIP5 being slightly more consistent over land than those from CMIP3 (Knutti and Sedláček, 2013). The largest percentage changes are at the high latitudes. By the end of the 21st century, over the large northern land masses, increased precipitation is likely under the RCP8.5 scenario in the winter and spring poleward of 50°N. The robustness across scenarios, the magnitude of the projected changes versus natural variability and physical explanations described above yield high confidence that the projected changes would be larger than natural 20-year variations (see {Box_12_1 Box 12.1}). In the tropics, precipitation changes exhibit strong regional contrasts, with increased precipitation over the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans and decreases over much of the subtropical ocean. However, decreases are not projected to be larger than natural 20-year variations anywhere until the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Decreased precipitation in the Mediterranean, Caribbean and Central America, southwestern United States and South Africa is likely under the RCP8.5 scenario and is projected with medium confidence to be larger than natural variations by the end of the 22nd century in some seasons ({Box_12_1 Box 12.1}). The CMIP3 models’ historical simulations of zonal mean precipitation trends were shown to underestimate observed trends ({cite.12.'Gillett_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Lambert_et_al_2005}; {cite.12.'Zhang_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Liepert_and_Previdi_2009}) (see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2.10_3_2_2 Section 10.3.2.2}). Therefore it is more likely than not that the magnitude of the projected future changes in {'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22} based on the multi-model mean is underestimated. Observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} including limited global coverage and large natural variability, in addition to challenges in precipitation modelling, limit confidence in assessment of climatic changes in precipitation.
