title: 12.4.5 - Changes in the Water Cycle

The {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} consists of water stored on the Earth in all its phases, along with the movement of water through the Earth’s climate system. In the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, water occurs primarily as gaseous water vapour, but it also occurs as solid ice and liquid water in clouds. The ocean is primarily liquid water, but is partly covered by ice in polar regions. Terrestrial water in liquid form appears as surface water (lakes, rivers), {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} and groundwater. Solid terrestrial water occurs in ice sheets, glaciers, frozen lakes, snow and ice on the surface and {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost}.

Projections of future changes in the water cycle are inextricably connected to changes in the energy cycle ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3 Section 12.4.3}) and atmospheric circulation ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4 Section 12.4.4}).

Saturation vapour pressure increases with temperature, but projected future changes in the water cycle are far more complex than projected temperature changes. Some regions of the world will be subject to decreases in hydrologic activity while others will be subject to increases. There are important local seasonal differences among the responses of the water cycle to climate change as well.

At first sight, the water cycles simulated by CMIP3/5 models may appear to be inconsistent, particularly at regional scales. {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} changes to the water cycle are superimposed on complex naturally varying modes of the climate (such as El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}), AO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}), etc.) aggravating the differences between model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. However, by careful consideration of the interaction of the water cycle with changes in other aspects of the climate system, the mechanisms of change are revealed, increasing confidence in projections.
