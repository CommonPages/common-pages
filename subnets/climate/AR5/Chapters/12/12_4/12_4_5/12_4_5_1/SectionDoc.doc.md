title: 12.4.5.1 - Atmospheric Humidity

Atmospheric water vapour is the primary GHG in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Its changes affect all parts of the {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle}. However, the amount of water vapour is dominated by naturally occurring processes and not significantly affected directly by {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities}. A common experience from past modelling studies is that {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} (RH) remains approximately constant on climatological time scales and planetary space scales, implying a strong constraint by the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausius–Clapeyron} relationship on how {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} will change. The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} stated that ‘a broad-scale, quasi-unchanged RH response [to climate change] is uncontroversial’ ({cite.12.'Randall_et_al_2007}). However, underlying this fairly straightforward behaviour are changes in RH that can influence changes in cloud cover and atmospheric {Glossary.*Convection convection} ({cite.12.'Sherwood_2010}). More recent analysis provides further detail and insight on RH changes. Analysis of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models shows near-surface RH decreasing over most land areas as temperatures increase with the notable exception of parts of tropical Africa (O’Gorman and Muller, 2010) ({'Figure_12_21 Figure 12.21}). The prime contributor to these decreases in RH over land is the larger temperature increases over land than over ocean in the RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} ({cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Fasullo_2010}; O’Gorman and Muller, 2010). The specific humidity of air originating over more slowly warming oceans will be governed by saturation temperatures of oceanic air. As this air moves over land and is warmed, its relative humidity drops as any further moistening of the air over land is insufficient to maintain constant RH, a behaviour {cite.12.'Sherwood_et_al_2010 Sherwood et al. (2010)} term a last-saturation-temperature constraint. The RH decrease over most land areas by the end of the 21st century is consistent with a last-saturation-temperature constraint and with observed behaviour during the first decade of the current century ({Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_5 Section 2.5.5}; {cite.12.'Simmons_et_al_2010}). Land– ocean differences in warming are {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} to continue through the 21st century, and although the CMIP5 projected changes are small, they are consistent with a last-saturation constraint, indicating with medium confidence that reductions in near-surface RH over many land areas are likely.
