title: 12.4.4.2 - Planetary-Scale Overturning Circulations

Large-scale atmospheric overturning circulations and their interaction with other atmospheric mechanisms are significant in determining tropical climate and regional changes in response to enhanced RF. Observed changes in tropical atmospheric circulation are assessed in {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_5 Section 2.7.5}, while {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3 Section 10.3.3} discusses {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of these observed changes to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing}. Evidence is inconclusive on recent trends in the strength of the Hadley ({cite.12.'Stachnik_and_Schumacher_2011}) and Walker Circulations ({cite.12.'Vecchi_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Sohn_and_Park_2010}; {cite.12.'Merrifield_2011}; {cite.12.'Luo_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Tokinaga_et_al_2012}), though there is medium confidence of an {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} influence on the observed widening of the {Glossary.*Hadley_Circulation Hadley Circulation} ({cite.12.'Hu_and_Fu_2007}; {cite.12.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}; {cite.12.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2012}). In the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, there are indications of a weakening of tropical overturning of air as the climate warms ({cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.12.'Gastineau_et_al_2008}, 2009; {cite.12.'Chou_and_Chen_2010}; {cite.12.'Chadwick_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). In the SRES A1B scenario, CMIP3 models show a remarkable agreement in simulating a weakening of the tropical atmospheric overturning circulation ({cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}). CMIP5 models also show a consistent weakening ({cite.12.'Chadwick_et_al_2012}). Along the ascending branches of tropical overturning cells, a reduction in convective mass flux from the boundary layer to the free {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is implied by the differential response to global warming of the boundary-layer moisture content and surface evaporation. This weakening of vertical motion along the ascending regions of both the tropical meridional and near-equatorial zonal cells is associated with an imbalance in the rate of atmospheric moisture increase and that of global mean precipitation ({cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). A reduction in the compensating climatological subsidence along the downward branches of overturning circulations, where the rate of increase of static stability exceeds radiative cooling, is implied.

Several mechanisms have been suggested for the changes in the intensity of the tropical overturning circulation. The weakening of low-level convective mass flux along ascending regions of tropical overturning cells has been ascribed to changes in the hydrologic cycle ({cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}). {Glossary.*Advection Advection} of dry air from subsidence regions towards the ascending branches of large-scale tropical circulation has been suggested to be a feasible mechanism weakening ascent along the edges of {Glossary.*Convection convection} regions ({cite.12.'Chou_et_al_2009}). A deepening of the tropical {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} in response to global warming increases the vertical extent of convection, which has been shown to increase the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}’s moist stability and thus also weakening overturning cells ({cite.12.'Chou_and_Chen_2010}). An imbalance between the increase in diabatic heating of the troposphere and in static stability whereby the latter increases more rapidly has also been thought to play a role in weakening tropical ascent ({cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2008}). Mean advection of enhanced vertical stratification under GHG forcing which involves cooling of convective regions and warming of subsidence regions has been shown to slow down tropical cells ({cite.12.'Ma_et_al_2012}). The latest findings using CMIP5 models reveal that an increase in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} (particularly {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}) contributes significantly to weakening tropical overturning cells by reducing radiative cooling in the upper atmosphere ({cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2013}). {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradients have also been found to play a role in altering the strength of tropical cells ({cite.12.'Tokinaga_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). Evidence has been provided suggesting that the SH Hadley Cell may strengthen in response to meridional SST gradients featuring reduced warming in the SH subtropical oceans relative to the NH, particularly over the Pacific and Indian Oceans ({cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). The north-to-south SST warming gradients are a {Glossary.*Source source} of intermodel differences in their projections of changes in the SH Hadley Circulation.

Apart from changes in Hadley Circulation strength, a robust feature in 21st century {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} simulations is an increase in the cell’s depth and width ({cite.12.'Mitas_and_Clement_2006}; {cite.12.'Frierson_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2008}), with the latter change translating to a broadening of tropical regions ({cite.12.'Seidel_and_Randel_2007}; {cite.12.'Seidel_et_al_2008}) and a poleward displacement of subtropical dry zones ({cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Scheff_and_Frierson_2012}). The increase in the cell’s depth is consistent with a tropical {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} rise. The projected increase in the height of the tropical tropopause and the associated increase in meridional temperature gradients close to the tropopause slope have been proposed to be an important mechanism behind the Hadley cell expansion and the poleward displacement of the subtropical westerly jet ({cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}). An increase in subtropical and mid-latitude static stability has been found to be an important factor widening the Hadley Cell by shifting baroclinic eddy activity and the associated eddy-driven jet and subsidence poleward ({cite.12.'Mitas_and_Clement_2006}; {cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2008}). The projected widening of the Hadley Cell is consistent with late 20th century observations, where ~2° to 5° latitude expansion was found ({cite.12.'Fu_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}). The consistency of simulated changes in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models and the consistency of Hadley Cell changes with the projected tropopause rise and increase in subtropical and mid-latitude static stability indicate that a widening and weakening of the NH Hadley Cell by the late 21st century is likely.

The zonally asymmetric {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} is projected to weaken under global warming ({cite.12.'Power_and_Kociuba_2011a}, 2011b), more than the Hadley Circulation ({cite.12.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}). The consistency of the projected Walker Circulation slowdown from CMIP3 to CMIP5 suggests that its change is robust ({cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). Almost everywhere around the equatorial belt, changes in the 500 hPa vertical motion oppose the climatological background motion, notably over the maritime continent ({cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.12.'Shongwe_et_al_2011}). Around the Indo-Pacific warm pool, in response to a spatially uniform SST warming, the climatological upper tropospheric divergence weakens ({cite.12.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}). Changes in the strength of the Walker Circulation also appear to be linked to differential warming between the Indian and Pacific Ocean warming at low latitudes ({cite.12.'Luo_et_al_2012}). Over the equatorial Pacific Ocean, where mid-tropospheric ascent is projected to strengthen, changes in zonal SST and hence {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure gradients induce low-level westerly wind anomalies that act to weaken the low-level branch of the Pacific Walker Circulation. These projected changes in the tropical Pacific circulation are already occurring ({cite.12.'Zhang_and_Song_2006}). However, the projected weakening of the Pacific Walker Cell does not imply an increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of El Niño events ({cite.12.'Collins_et_al_2010}). The consistency of simulated changes in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models and the consistency of Walker Cell changes with equatorial SST and pressure-gradient changes that are already observed indicate that a weakening of the Walker Cell by the late 21st century is likely.

In the upper atmosphere, a robust feature of projected stratospheric circulation change is that the {Glossary.*Brewer_Dobson_circulation Brewer–Dobson circulation} will likely strengthen in the 21st century ({cite.12.'Butchart_et_al_2006}, 2010; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'McLandress_and_Shepherd_2009}; {cite.12.'Shepherd_and_McLandress_2011}). In a majority of model experiments, the projected changes in the large-scale overturning circulation in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} feature an intensification of tropical upward mass flux, which may extend to the upper stratosphere. The proposed driver of the increase in mass flux at the tropical lower stratosphere is the enhanced propagation of wave activity, mainly resolved planetary waves, associated with a positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} in zonal wind structure ({cite.12.'Butchart_and_Scaife_2001}; {cite.12.'Garcia_and_Randel_2008}). In the 21st century, increases in wave excitation from diabatic heating in the upper tropical troposphere could reinforce the wave forcing on the tropical upwelling branch of the stratospheric mean meridional circulation ({cite.12.'Calvo_and_Garcia_2009}). Parameterized orographic gravity waves that result from strengthening of subtropical westerly jets and cause more waves to propagate into the lower stratosphere also play a role ({cite.12.'Sigmond_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Butchart_et_al_2006}). The projected intensification in tropical upwelling is counteracted by enhanced mean extratropical/polar lower stratospheric subsidence. In the NH high latitudes, the enhanced downwelling is associated with an increase in stationary planetary wave activities ({cite.12.'McLandress_and_Shepherd_2009}). The intensification of the stratospheric meridional residual circulation has already been reported in studies focussing on the last decades of the 20th century ({cite.12.'Garcia_and_Randel_2008}; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Young_et_al_2012}). The projected increase in troposphere-to-stratosphere mass exchange rate ({cite.12.'Butchart_et_al_2006}) and stratospheric mixing associated with the strengthening of the Brewer–Dobson circulation will likely result in a decrease in the mean age of air in the lower stratosphere. In the mid-latitude lower stratosphere, quasi-horizontal mixing is a significant contributor to reducing the lifetimes of air. There are some suggestions that the changes in stratospheric overturning circulation could lead to a reduction in tropical {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} concentrations and an increase at high latitudes ({cite.12.'Jiang_et_al_2007}) and an increase in the amplitude of the annual cycle of stratospheric ozone ({cite.12.'Randel_et_al_2007}).
