title: 12.4.4.3 - Extratropical Storms: Tracks and Influences on Planetary-Scale Circulation and Transports

Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, there has been continued evaluation of changes in extratropical {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} under projected warming using both CMIP3 and, more recently, CMIP5 simulations, as well as supporting studies using single models or idealized simulations. CMIP3 analyses use a variety of methods for diagnosing storm tracks, but diagnosis of changes in the tracks appears to be relatively insensitive to methods used ({cite.12.'Ulbrich_et_al_2013}). Analyses of SH storm tracks generally agree with earlier studies, showing that extratropical storm tracks will tend to shift poleward ({cite.12.'Bengtsson_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Gastineau_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Gastineau_and_Soden_2009}; {cite.12.'Perrie_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Schuenemann_and_Cassano_2010}; {cite.12.'Chang_et_al_2012b}). The behaviour is consistent with a likely {Glossary.*Trend trend} in observed storm-track behaviour (see {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_6 Section 2.7.6}). Similar behaviour appears in CMIP5 simulations for the SH ({'Figure_12_20 Figure 12.20}c, d). In SH winter there is a clear poleward shift in storm tracks of several degrees and a reduction in storm frequency of only a few percent (not shown). The poleward shift at the end of the century is consistent with a poleward shift in the SH of the latitudes with strongest tropospheric jets ({'Figure_12_19 Figure 12.19}). This appears to coincide with shifts in baroclinic dynamics governing extratropical storms ({cite.12.'Frederiksen_et_al_2011}), though the degree of jet shift appears to be sensitive to bias in a model’s contemporary-climate storm tracks ({cite.12.'Chang_et_al_2012a}, 2012b). Although there is thus some {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the degree of shift, the consistency of behaviour with observation-based trends, consistency between CMIP5 and CMIP3 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} under a variety of diagnostics and the physical consistency of the storm response with other climatic changes gives high confidence that a poleward shift of several degrees in SH storm tracks is likely by the end of the 21st century under the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario.

In the NH winter ({'Figure_12_20 Figure 12.20}a, b), the CMIP5 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} shows an overall reduced frequency of storms and less indication of a poleward shift in the tracks. The clearest poleward shift in the NH winter at the end of the 21st century occurs in the Asia-Pacific storm track, where intensification of the westerly jet promotes more intense cyclones in an ensemble of CMIP5 models ({cite.12.'Mizuta_2012}). Otherwise, changes in winter storm-track magnitude, as measured by band-pass {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure fluctuations, show only small change relative to interannual and inter-decadal variability by the end of the 21st century in SRES A1B and RCP4.5 simulations for several land areas over the NH ({cite.12.'Harvey_et_al_2012}). Consistency in CMIP3 and CMIP5 changes seen in the SH are absent in the NH ({cite.12.'Chang_et_al_2012a}). Factors identified that affect changes in the North Atlantic basin’s storm track include horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ({cite.12.'Colle_et_al_2013}) and how models simulate changes in the Atlantic’s {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation meridional overturning circulation} ({cite.12.'Catto_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Woollings_et_al_2012}), the zonal jet and {Glossary.*Hadley_Circulation Hadley Circulation} ({cite.12.'Mizuta_2012}; {cite.12.'Zappa_et_al_2013}) and subtropical upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} temperature ({cite.12.'Haarsma_et_al_2013}). Substantial uncertainty and thus low confidence remains in projecting changes in NH winter storm tracks, especially for the North Atlantic basin.

Additional analyses of CMIP3 {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} have determined other changes in properties of extratropical storms. Most analyses find that the frequency of storms decreases in projected climates ({cite.12.'Finnis_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Favre_and_Gershunov_2009}; {cite.12.'Dowdy_et_al_2013}), though the occurrence of strong storms may increase in some regions ({cite.12.'Pinto_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Bengtsson_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Zappa_et_al_2013}). Many studies focus on behaviour of specific regions, and results of these studies are detailed in {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}.

Changes in extratropical storms in turn may influence other large-scale climatic changes. {cite.12.'Kug_et_al_2010 Kug et al. (2010)} in a set of time-slice simulations show that a poleward shift of storm tracks in the NH could enhance polar warming and moistening. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is sensitive to synoptic eddy vorticity flux, so that projected changes in storm tracks can alter the AO ({cite.12.'Choi_et_al_2010}). The net result is that changes in extratropical storms alter the climate in which they are embedded, so that links between surface warming, extratropical storms and their influence on climate are more complex than simple responses to changes in baroclinicity (O’Gorman, 2010).
