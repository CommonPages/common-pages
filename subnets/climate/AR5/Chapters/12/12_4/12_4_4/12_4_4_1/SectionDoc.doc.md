title: 12.4.4.1 - Mean Sea Level Pressure and Upper-Air Winds

Sea level pressure gives an indication of surface changes in atmospheric circulation ({'Figure_12_18 Figure 12.18}). As in previous assessments, a robust feature of the pattern of change is a decrease in high latitudes and increases in the mid-latitudes, associated with poleward shifts in the SH mid-latitude {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4.12_4_4_3 Section 12.4.4.3}) and positive trends in the {Glossary.*Annular_modes annular modes} ({Chapters.14.14_5 Section 14.5}) as well as an expansion of the Hadley Cell ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4.12_4_4_2 Section 12.4.4.2}). Similar patterns of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure change are found in observed trends over recent decades, suggesting an already detectable change ({cite.12.'Gillett_and_Stott_2009}; {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3.10_3_3_4 Section 10.3.3.4}), although the observed patterns are influenced by both natural and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} as well as {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} and the relative importance of these influences is likely to change in the future. Internal variability has been found to play a large role in {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} of future sea level pressure {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, particularly at higher latitudes ({cite.12.'Deser_et_al_2012a}).

In boreal winter, decreases of sea level pressure over NH high latitudes are slightly weaker in the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} compared to previous assessments, consistent with {cite.12.'Scaife_et_al_2012 Scaife et al. (2012)} and {cite.12.'Karpechko_and_Manzini_2012 Karpechko and Manzini (2012)}, who suggest that improvements in the representation of the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} can influence this pattern. In austral summer, the SH projections are impacted by the additional influence of stratospheric ozone recovery (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4.11_3_2_4_2 Section 11.3.2.4.2}) which opposes changes due to {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}. Under the weaker GHG {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, decreases in sea level pressure over the SH mid-latitudes and increases over SH high latitudes are consistent with expected changes from ozone recovery ({cite.12.'Arblaster_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'McLandress_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Polvani_et_al_2011}). For all other {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}, the magnitude of SH extratropical changes scales with the RF, as found in previous model ensembles ({cite.12.'Paeth_and_Pollinger_2010}; {cite.12.'Simpkins_and_Karpechko_2012}).

Large increases in seasonal sea level pressure are also found in regions of sub-tropical drying such as the Mediterranean and northern Africa in DJF and Australia in JJA. Projected changes in the tropics are less consistent across the models; however, a decrease in the eastern equatorial Pacific and increase over the maritime continent, associated with a weakening of the {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.12.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.12.'Power_and_Kociuba_2011b}), is found in all RCPs.

Future changes in zonal and annual mean zonal winds ({'Figure_12_19 Figure 12.19}) are seen throughout the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} with stronger changes in higher RCPs. Large increases in winds are evident in the tropical stratosphere and a poleward shift and intensification of the SH tropospheric jet is seen under RCP4.5 and {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}, associated with an increase in the SH upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient ({'Figure_12_12 Figure 12.12}) ({cite.12.'Wilcox_et_al_2012}). In the NH, the response of the tropospheric jet is weaker and complicated by the additional thermal forcing of polar amplification ({cite.12.'Woollings_2008}). {cite.12.'Barnes_and_Polvani_2013 Barnes and Polvani (2013)} evaluate changes in the annual mean mid-latitude jets in the CMIP5 ensemble, finding consistent poleward shifts in both hemispheres under RCP8.5 for the end of the 21st century. In the NH, the poleward shift is ~1°, similar to that found for the CMIP3 ensemble ({cite.12.'Woollings_and_Blackburn_2012}). In the SH, the annual mean mid-latitude jet shifts poleward by ~2° under RCP8.5 at the end of the 21st century in the CMIP5 multi-model mean ({cite.12.'Barnes_and_Polvani_2013}), with a similar shift of 1.5° in the surface westerlies ({cite.12.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}). A strengthening of the SH surface westerlies is also found under all RCPs except RCP2.6 ({cite.12.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}), with largest changes in the Pacific basin ({cite.12.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2013}). In austral summer, ozone recovery offsets changes in GHGs to some extent, with a weak reversal of the jet shift found in the multi-model mean under the low {Topics.*Scenarios emissions scenario} of RCP2.6 ({cite.12.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}) and weak or poleward shifts in other RCPs ({cite.12.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}; {cite.12.'Wilcox_et_al_2012}). {cite.12.'Eyring_et_al_2013 Eyring et al. (2013)} note the sensitivity of the CMIP5 SH summertime circulation changes to both the strength of the ozone recovery (simulated by some models interactively) and the rate of GHG increases.

Although the poleward shift of the tropospheric jets are robust across models and likely under increased GHGs, the dynamical mechanisms behind these projections are still not completely understood and have been explored in both simple and complex models ({cite.12.'Chen_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Lim_and_Simmonds_2009}; {cite.12.'Butler_et_al_2010}). The shifts are associated with a strengthening in the upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient ({cite.12.'Wilcox_et_al_2012}) and hypotheses for associated changes in planetary wave activity and/or synoptic eddy characteristics that impact on the position of the jet have been put forward ({cite.12.'Gerber_et_al_2012}). Equatorward biases in the position of the SH jet ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_2 Section 9.5.3.2}), while somewhat improved over similar biases in the CMIP3 models ({cite.12.'Kidston_and_Gerber_2010}) still remain, limiting our confidence in the magnitude of future changes.

In summary, poleward shifts in the mid-latitude jets of about 1 to 2 degrees latitude are likely at the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 in both hemispheres (medium confidence) with weaker shifts in the NH and under lower emission scenarios. {Glossary.*Ozone Ozone} recovery will likely weaken the GHG-induced changes in the SH extratropical circulation in austral summer.
