title: 12.4.4 - Changes in Atmospheric Circulation

Projected changes in energy and water cycles couple with changes in atmospheric circulation and mass distribution. Understanding this coupling is necessary to assess physical behaviour underlying {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} changes, particularly at regional scales, revealing why changes occur and the realism of the changes. The focus in this section is on atmospheric circulation behaviour that CMIP5 {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} resolve well. Thus, the section includes discussion of extratropical cyclones but not tropical cyclones: extratropical cyclones are fairly well resolved by most CMIP5 {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs}, whereas tropical cyclones are not, requiring resolutions finer than used by the large majority of CMIP5 GCMs (see {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_4.9_5_4_3 Section 9.5.4.3}). Detailed discussion of tropical cyclones appears in {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 Section 14.6.1} (see also {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_5.11_3_2_5_3 Section 11.3.2.5.3} for near term changes and {Chapters.3.3_4.3_4_4 Section 3.4.4} in {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012 Seneviratne et al. (2012)}). Regional detail concerning extratropical {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks}, including causal processes, appears in {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2} (see also {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4 Section 11.3.2.4} for near-term changes and {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012 Seneviratne et al. (2012)} for an assessment of projected changes related to weather and climate extremes).
