title: 12.4.3.5 - Clouds

This section provides a summary description of future changes in clouds and their feedbacks on climate. A more general and more precise description and assessment of the role of clouds in the climate system is provided in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}, in particular {Chapters.7.7_2 Section 7.2} for cloud processes and feedbacks and {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4} for {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments are presented in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5 Section 7.2.5} and a synthesis is provided in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_6 Section 7.2.6}. Clouds are a major component of the climate system and play an important role in {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} ({cite.12.'Cess_et_al_1990}; {cite.12.'Randall_et_al_2007}), the {Glossary.*Diurnal_temperature_range diurnal temperature range} (DTR) over land ({cite.12.'Zhou_et_al_2009}), and land–sea contrast (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_1 Section 12.4.3.1}). The observed global mean cloud {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} is about –20 W m–2 ({cite.12.'Loeb_et_al_2009}) (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_1 Section 7.2.1}), that is, clouds have a net cooling effect. Current {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} simulate clouds through various complex parameterizations (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3 Section 7.2.3}), and cloud {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} is a major {Glossary.*Source source} of the spread of the climate sensitivity estimate ({cite.12.'Soden_and_Held_2006}; {cite.12.'Randall_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Dufresne_and_Bony_2008}) (see {Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_2 Section 9.7.2}).

Under future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} the multi-model pattern of total cloud amount shows consistent decreases in the subtropics, in conjunction with a decrease of the {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} there, and increases at high latitudes. Another robust pattern is an increase in cloud cover at all latitudes in the vicinity of the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause}, a signature of the increase of the altitude of high level clouds in convective regions ({cite.12.'Wetherald_and_Manabe_1988}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.12.'Soden_and_Vecchi_2011}; {cite.12.'Zelinka_et_al_2012}). Low-level clouds were identified as a primary cause of inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in cloud feedbacks in CMIP3 models (Bony and

Dufresne, 2005; {cite.12.'Webb_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Wyant_et_al_2006}). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, these results have been confirmed along with the positive feedbacks due to high level clouds in the CMIP3 or CFMIP models ({cite.12.'Zelinka_and_Hartmann_2010}; {cite.12.'Soden_and_Vecchi_2011}; {cite.12.'Webb_et_al_2013}) and CMIP5 models ({cite.12.'Vial_et_al_2013}). Since AR4, the response of clouds has been partitioned in a direct or ‘rapid’ response of clouds to {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and a ‘slow’ response of clouds to the {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} increase (i.e., the usual feedback response) ({cite.12.'Gregory_and_Webb_2008}). The {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} of clouds depends mainly on their fraction, optical depth and temperature. The contribution of these variables to the {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} has been quantified for the multi-model CMIP3 ({cite.12.'Soden_and_Vecchi_2011}) and CFMIP1 database ({cite.12.'Zelinka_et_al_2012}). These findings are consistent with the radiative changes obtained with the CMIP5 models ({'Figure_12_16 Figure 12.16}) and may be summarized as follows (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5 Section 7.2.5} for more details).

The dominant contributor to the SW cloud feedback is the change in cloud fraction. The reduction of cloud fraction between 50°S and 50°N, except along the equator and the eastern part of the ocean basins ({'Figure_12_17 Figure 12.17}), contributes to an increase in the absorbed {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} ({'Figure_12_16 Figure 12.16}c). Physical mechanisms and the role of different parameterizations have been proposed to explain this reduction of low-level clouds ({cite.12.'Zhang_and_Bretherton_2008}; {cite.12.'Caldwell_and_Bretherton_2009}; {cite.12.'Brient_and_Bony_2013}; {cite.12.'Webb_et_al_2013}). Poleward of 50°S, the cloud fraction and the cloud optical depth increases, thereby increasing cloud reflectance. This leads to a decrease of solar absorption around Antarctica where the ocean is nearly ice free in summer ({'Figure_12_16 Figure 12.16}c). However, there is low confidence in this result because {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} do not reproduce the nearly 100% cloud cover observed there and the negative feedback could be overestimated ({cite.12.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010}) or, at the opposite, underestimated because the cloud optical depth simulated by models is biased high there ({cite.12.'Zelinka_et_al_2012}).

In the LW domain, the tropical high cloud changes exert the dominant effect. A lifting of the cloud top with warming is simulated consistently across models ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}) which leads to a positive feedback whereby the LW {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from high clouds decrease as they cool ({'Figure_12_16 Figure 12.16}b). The dominant driver of this effect is the increase of tropopause height and physical explanations have been proposed ({cite.12.'Hartmann_and_Larson_2002}; {cite.12.'Lorenz_and_DeWeaver_2007}; {cite.12.'Zelinka_and_Hartmann_2010}). Although the decrease in cloudiness generally increases outgoing {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation} and partly offsets the effect of cloud rising, the net effect is a consistent positive global mean LW cloud feedback across CMIP and CFMIP models. Global mean SW cloud feedbacks range from slightly negative to strongly positive ({cite.12.'Soden_and_Vecchi_2011}; {cite.12.'Zelinka_et_al_2012}), with an inter-model spread in net cloud feedback being mainly attributable to low-level cloud changes.

In summary, both the multi-model mean and the inter-model spread of the cloud fraction and radiative flux changes simulated by the CMIP5 models are consistent with those previously obtained by the CMIP3 models. These include decreases in cloud amount in the subtropics, increases at high latitudes and increases in the altitude of high level clouds in convective regions. Many of these changes have been understood primarily as responses to large-scale circulation changes (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_6 Section 7.2.6}).
