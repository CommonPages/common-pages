title: 12.4.3.3 - Temperature Extremes

As the climate continues to warm, changes in several types of {Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} have been observed ({cite.12.'Donat_et_al_2013}), and are expected to continue in the future in concert with global warming ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). Extremes occur on multiple time scales, from a single day or a few consecutive days (a {Glossary.*Heat_wave heat wave}) to monthly and seasonal events. Extreme temperature events are often defined by indices (see {Box_2_4 Box 2.4} for the common definitions used), for example, percentage of days in a year when maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile of a present day distribution or by long period return values. Although changes in temperature extremes are a very robust signature of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} climate change ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}), the magnitude of change and consensus among models varies with the characteristics of the event being considered (e.g., time scale, magnitude, duration and spatial extent) as well as the definition used to describe the extreme.

Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} many advances have been made in establishing global observed records of extremes ({cite.12.'Alexander_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Perkins_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Donat_et_al_2013}) against which models can be evaluated to give context to future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({cite.12.'Sillmann_and_Roeckner_2008}; {cite.12.'Alexander_and_Arblaster_2009}). Numerous regional assessments of future changes in extremes have also been performed and a comprehensive summary of these is given in {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012 Seneviratne et al. (2012)}. Here we summarize the key findings from this report and assess updates since then.

It is virtually certain that there will be more hot and fewer cold extremes as global temperature increases ({cite.12.'Caesar_and_Lowe_2012}; {cite.12.'Orlowsky_and_Seneviratne_2012}; {cite.12.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}), consistent with previous assessments ({cite.12.'Solomon_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). {'Figure_12_13 Figure 12.13} shows multi-model mean changes in the absolute temperature indices of the coldest day of the year and the hottest day of the year and the threshold-based indices of frost days and tropical nights from the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} ({cite.12.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). A robust increase in warm temperature extremes and decrease in cold temperature extremes is found at the end of the 21st century, with the magnitude of the changes increasing with increased {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing}. The coldest night of the year undergoes larger increases than the hottest day in the globally averaged time series ({'Figure_12_13 Figure 12.13}b and d). This tendency is consistent with the CMIP3 model results shown in {'Figure_12_13 Figure 12.13}, which use different models and the SRES {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} (see {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012 Seneviratne et al. (2012)} for earlier CMIP3 results). Similarly, increases in the frequency of warm nights are greater than increases in the frequency of warm days ({cite.12.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). Regionally, the largest increases in the coldest night of the year are projected in the high latitudes of the NH under the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario ({'Figure_12_13 Figure 12.13}a). The subtropics and mid-latitudes exhibit the greatest projected changes in the hottest day of the year, whereas changes in tropical nights and the frequency of warm days and warm nights are largest in the tropics ({cite.12.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). The number of frost days declines in all regions while significant increases in tropical nights are seen in southeastern North America, the Mediterranean and central Asia.

It is very likely that, on average, there will be more record high than record cold temperatures in a warmer average climate. For example, {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2009 Meehl et al. (2009)} find that the current ratio of 2 to 1 for record daily high maxima to low minima over the USA becomes approximately 20 to 1 by the mid-21st century and 50 to 1 by late century in their model simulation of the SRES A1B scenario. However, even at the end of the century daily record low minima continue to be broken, if in a small number, consistent with {cite.12.'Kodra_et_al_2011 Kodra et al. (2011)}, who conclude that cold extremes will continue to occur in a warmer climate, even though their frequency will decline.

It is also very likely that heat waves, defined as spells of days with temperature above a threshold determined from historical climatology, will occur with a higher frequency and duration, mainly as a direct consequence of the increase in seasonal mean temperatures ({cite.12.'Barnett_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Ballester_et_al_2010a}, 2010b; Fischer and Schär, 2010). Changes in the absolute value of temperature extremes are also very likely and expected to regionally exceed global temperature increases by far, with substantial changes in hot extremes projected even for moderate (<2.5°C above present day) average warming levels ({cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Diffenbaugh_and_Ashfaq_2010}). These changes often differ from the mean temperature increase, as a result of changes in variability and shape of the temperature distribution ({cite.12.'Hegerl_et_al_2004}; {cite.12.'Meehl_and_Tebaldi_2004}; {cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2006}). For example, summer temperature extremes over central and southern Europe are projected to warm substantially more than the corresponding mean local temperatures as a result of enhanced temperature variability at interannual to intraseasonal time scales (Schär et al., 2004; {cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Kjellstrom_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Vidale_et_al_2007}; Fischer and Schär, 2009, 2010; {cite.12.'Nikulin_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2012a}). Several recent studies have also argued that the probability of occurrence of a Russian heat wave at least as severe as the one in 2010 increases substantially (by a factor of 5 to 10 by the mid-century) along with increasing mean temperatures and enhanced temperature variability ({cite.12.'Barriopedro_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Dole_et_al_2011}).

Since the AR4, an increased understanding of mechanisms and feedbacks leading to projected changes in extremes has been gained ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} suggest that hot extremes are amplified by {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}-temperature feedbacks ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Diffenbaugh_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Lenderink_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Vidale_et_al_2007}; Fischer and Schär, 2009; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2012a}) in northern mid-latitude regions as the climate warms, consistent with previous assessments. Changes in temperature extremes may also be impacted by changes in land–sea contrast, with {cite.12.'Watterson_et_al_2008 Watterson et al. (2008)} showing an amplification of southern Australian summer warm extremes over the mean due to anomalous temperature {Glossary.*Advection advection} from warmer continental interiors. The largest increases in the magnitude of warm extremes are simulated over mid-latitude continental areas, consistent with the drier conditions, and the associated reduction in evaporative cooling from the land surface projected over these areas ({cite.12.'Kharin_et_al_2007}). The representation of the latter constitutes a major {Glossary.*Source source} of model uncertainty for projections of the absolute magnitude of temperature extremes ({cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2011}).

Winter cold extremes also warm more than the local mean temperature over northern high latitudes ({cite.12.'Orlowsky_and_Seneviratne_2012}; {cite.12.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}) as a result of reduced temperature variability related to declining snow cover ({cite.12.'Gregory_and_Mitchell_1995}; {cite.12.'Kjellstrom_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2011}) and decreases in land–sea contrast (de Vries et al., 2012). Changes in atmospheric circulation, induced by remote surface heating can also modify the temperature distribution ({cite.12.'Haarsma_et_al_2009}). Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli (2009) note that cold winter extremes over Europe are in part driven by atmospheric {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} and changes to these blocking patterns in the future lead to changes in the frequency and spatial distribution of cold temperature extremes as global temperatures increase. Occasional cold winters will continue to occur (Räisänen and Ylhaisi, 2011).

Human discomfort, morbidity and mortality during heat waves depend not only on temperature but also {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity}. Heat stress, defined as the combined effect of temperature and humidity, is expected to increase along with warming temperatures and dominates the local decrease in summer {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} due to soil drying ({cite.12.'Diffenbaugh_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2012b}; {cite.12.'Dunne_et_al_2013}). Areas with abundant atmospheric moisture availability and high present-day temperatures such as Mediterranean coastal regions are expected to experience the greatest heat stress changes because the heat stress response scales with humidity which thus becomes increasingly important to heat stress at higher temperatures (Fischer and Schär, 2010; {cite.12.'Sherwood_and_Huber_2010}; {cite.12.'Willett_and_Sherwood_2012}). For some regions, simulated heat stress indicators are remarkably robust, because those models with stronger warming simulate a stronger decrease in atmospheric relative humidity ({cite.12.'Fischer_and_Knutti_2013}).

Changes in rare temperature extremes can be assessed using extreme value theory based techniques ({cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). {cite.12.'Kharin_et_al_2007 Kharin et al. (2007)}, in an analysis of CMIP3 models, found large increases in the 20-year return values of the annual maximum and minimum daily averaged surface air temperatures (i.e., the size of an event that would be expected on average once every 20 years, or with a 5% chance every year) with larger changes over land than ocean. {'Figure_12_14 Figure 12.14} displays the end of 21st century change in the magnitude of these rare events from the CMIP5 models in the {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios ({cite.12.'Kharin_et_al_2013}). Comparison to the changes in summer mean temperature shown in Figure AI.5 and A1.7 of Annex I Supplementary Material reveals that rare high temperature events are projected to change at rates similar to or slightly larger than the summertime mean temperature in many land areas. However, in much of Northern Europe 20-year return values of daily high temperatures are projected to increase 2°C or more than JJA mean temperatures under RCP8.5, consistent with previous studies ({cite.12.'Sterl_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Orlowsky_and_Seneviratne_2012}). Rare low temperature events are projected to experience significantly larger increases than the mean in most land regions, with a pronounced effect at high latitudes. Twenty-year return values of cold extremes increase significantly more than winter mean temperature changes, particularly over parts of North America and Europe. {cite.12.'Kharin_et_al_2013 Kharin et al. (2013)} concluded from the CMIP5 models that it is likely that in most land regions a current 20 year maximum temperature event is projected to become a one-in-two-year event by the end of the 21st century under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, except for some regions of the high latitudes of the NH where it is likely to become a one-in-five-year event (see also {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012 Seneviratne et al. (2012)} {'Figure_3_5 Figure 3.5}). Current 20-year minimum temperature events are projected to become exceedingly rare, with return periods likely increasing to more than 100 years in almost all locations under RCP8.5 ({cite.12.'Kharin_et_al_2013}). {Chapters.10.10_6.10_6_1.10_6_1_1 Section 10.6.1.1} notes that a number of {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} since SREX suggest that the model changes may tend to be too large for warm extremes and too small for cold extremes and thus these {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} statements are somewhat less strongly stated than a direct interpretation of model output and its ranges. The CMIP5 analysis shown in {'Figure_12_14 Figure 12.14} reinforces this assessment of large changes in the frequency of rare events, particularly in the RCP8.5 scenario ({cite.12.'Kharin_et_al_2013}).

{image:'Figure_12_14}

There is high consensus among models in the sign of the future change in temperature extremes, with recent studies confirming this conclusion from the previous assessments ({cite.12.'Tebaldi_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}; {cite.12.'Orlowsky_and_Seneviratne_2012}; {cite.12.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}; {cite.12.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). However, the magnitude of the change remains uncertain owing to scenario and model (both structural and parameter) uncertainty ({cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2010}) as well as {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}. These {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are much larger than corresponding uncertainties in the magnitude of mean temperature change ({cite.12.'Barnett_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2006}; Fischer and Schär, 2010; {cite.12.'Fischer_et_al_2011}).
