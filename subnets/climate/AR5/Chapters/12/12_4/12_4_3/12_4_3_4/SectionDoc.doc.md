title: 12.4.3.4 - Energy Budget

{Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} or natural perturbations to the climate system produce RFs that result in an imbalance in the global {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} at the top of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} (TOA) and affect the global mean temperature ({Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_3 Section 12.3.3}). The climate responds to a change in RF on multiple time scales and at multiyear time scales the energy imbalance (i.e., the energy heating or cooling the Earth) is very close to the ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} due to the much lower thermal inertia of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and the continental surfaces ({cite.12.'Levitus_et_al_2005}; {cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2008a}; {cite.12.'Murphy_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2011}). The radiative responses of the fluxes at TOA are generally analysed using the forcing-{Glossary.*Feedback feedback} framework and are presented in {Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_2 Section 9.7.2}.

CMIP5 models simulate a small increase of the energy imbalance at the TOA over the 20th century (see {Box_3_1 Box 3.1}, {Box_9_2 Box 9.2} and {Box_13_1 Box 13.1}). The future evolution of the imbalance is very different depending on the scenario ({'Figure_12_15 Figure 12.15}a): for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} it continues to increase rapidly, much less for RCP6.0, it is almost constant for RCP4.5 and decreases for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}. This latter negative {Glossary.*Trend trend} reveals the quasi-stabilization characteristic of RCP2.6. (In a transient scenario simulation, the TOA imbalance is always less than the RF because of the slow rate of ocean heat uptake.)

The rapid fluctuations that are simulated during the 20th century originate from volcanic eruptions that are prescribed in the models (see {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_2 Section 12.3.2}). These aerosols reflect {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} and thus decrease the amount of SW radiation absorbed by the Earth ({'Figure_12_15 Figure 12.15}c). The minimum of shortwave (SW) radiation absorbed by the Earth during the period 1960–2000 is due mainly to two factors: a sequence of volcanic eruptions and an increase of the reflecting {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} burden due to {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities} (see Sections {Chapters.7.7_5 7.5}, {Chapters.8.8_5 8.5} and {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_6 9.4.6}). During the 21st century, the absorbed SW radiation monotonically increases for the RCP8.5 scenario, and increases and subsequently stabilizes for the other {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, consistent with what has been previously obtained with CMIP3 models and {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} ({cite.12.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2009}). The two main contributions to the SW changes are the change of clouds (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_5 Section 12.4.3.5}) and the change of the {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere} (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6 Section 12.4.6}) at high latitudes. In the longwave (LW) domain ({'Figure_12_15 Figure 12.15}b), the net flux at TOA represents the opposite of the flux that is emitted by the Earth’s surface and atmosphere toward space, i.e., a negative anomaly represents an increase of the emitted LW radiation. The LW net flux depends mainly on two factors: the {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} and the magnitude of the {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect} of the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the rapid fluctuations of LW radiation are driven by volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, which decrease the absorbed SW radiation, {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature}, and the LW radiation emitted by the Earth toward space. During the period 1960–2000, the fast increase of GHG concentrations also decreases the radiation emitted by the Earth. In response to this net heating of the Earth, temperatures warm and thereby increase emitted LW radiation although the change of the temperature vertical profile, water vapour, and cloud properties modulate this response (e.g., {cite.12.'Bony_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Randall_et_al_2007}).
