title: 12.4.3.1 - Patterns of Surface Warming: Land–Sea Contrast, Polar Amplification and Sea Surface Temperatures

Patterns of surface air temperature change for various {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} show widespread warming during the 21st century ({'Figure_12_11 Figure 12.11}; see Annex I for seasonal patterns). A key feature that has been present throughout the history of coupled modelling is the larger warming over land compared to oceans, which occurs in both transient and equilibrium climate change (e.g., {cite.12.'Manabe_et_al_1990}). The degree to which warming is larger over land than ocean is remarkably constant over time under transient warming due to {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} ({cite.12.'Lambert_and_Chiang_2007}; {cite.12.'Boer_2011}; {cite.12.'Lambert_et_al_2011}) suggesting that heat capacity differences between land and ocean do not play a major role in the land–sea warming contrast ({cite.12.'Sutton_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2008}, 2013). The phenomenon is predominantly a feature of the surface and lower {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2008}). Studies have found it occurs due to contrasts in surface sensible and latent fluxes over land ({cite.12.'Sutton_et_al_2007}), land–ocean contrasts in boundary layer {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} changes ({cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2008}), boundary layer {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} and associated low-level cloud cover changes over land (Doutriaux-Boucher et al., 2009; {cite.12.'Fasullo_2010}) and {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} reductions ({cite.12.'Dong_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Clark_et_al_2010}) under climate change. The land–sea warming contrast is also sensitive to {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.12.'Allen_and_Sherwood_2010}; {cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2013}). Globally averaged warming over land and ocean is identified separately in {'Table_12_2 Table 12.2} for the CMIP5 models and the ratio of land to ocean warming is likely in the range of 1.4 to 1.7, consistent with previous studies ({cite.12.'Lambert_et_al_2011}). The CMIP5 multi-model mean ratio is approximately constant from 2020 through to 2100 (based on an update of {cite.12.'Joshi_et_al_2008} from available CMIP5 models).

Amplified surface warming in Arctic latitudes is also a consistent feature in climate model integrations (e.g., {cite.12.'Manabe_and_Stouffer_1980}). This is often referred to as polar amplification, although numerous studies have shown that under transient forcing, this is primarily an Arctic phenomenon ({cite.12.'Manabe_et_al_1991}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}). The lack of an amplified transient warming response in high Southern polar latitudes has been associated with deep ocean mixing, strong ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} and the persistence of the vast Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet}. In equilibrium simulations, amplified warming occurs in both polar regions.

On an annual average, and depending on the forcing scenario (see {'Table_12_2 Table 12.2}), the CMIP5 models show a mean Arctic (67.5°N to 90°N) warming between 2.2 and 2.4 times the global average warming for 2081–2100 compared to 1986–2005. Similar polar amplification factors occurred in earlier coupled model simulations (e.g., {cite.12.'Holland_and_Bitz_2003}; {cite.12.'Winton_2006a}). This factor in models is slightly higher than the observed central value, but it is within the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of the best estimate from observations of the recent past ({cite.12.'Bekryaev_et_al_2010}). The uncertainty is large in the observed factor because station records are short and sparse ({cite.12.'Serreze_and_Francis_2006}) and the forced signal is contaminated by the noise of {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}. By contrast, model trends in surface air temperature are 2.5 to 5 times higher than observed over Antarctica, but here also the observational estimates have a very large uncertainty, so, for example, the CMIP3 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean is consistent with observations within error estimates ({cite.12.'Monaghan_et_al_2008}). Moreover, recent work suggests more widespread current West Antarctic surface warming than previously estimated ({cite.12.'Bromwich_et_al_2013}).

The amplified Arctic warming in models has a distinct seasonal character ({cite.12.'Manabe_and_Stouffer_1980}; {cite.12.'Rind_1987}; {cite.12.'Holland_and_Bitz_2003}; {cite.12.'Lu_and_Cai_2009}; {cite.12.'Kumar_et_al_2010}). Arctic amplification (defined as the 67.5 N° to 90°N warming compared to the global average warming for 2081–2100 versus 1986–2005) peaks in early winter (November to December) with a CMIP5 RCP4.5 multi-model mean warming for 67.5°N to 90°N exceeding the global average by a factor of more than 4. The warming is smallest in summer when excess heat at the Arctic surface goes into melting ice or is absorbed by the ocean, which has a relatively large thermal inertia. Simulated Arctic warming also has a consistent vertical structure that is largest in the lower {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} (e.g., {cite.12.'Manabe_et_al_1991}; {cite.12.'Kay_et_al_2012}). This is in agreement with recent observations ({cite.12.'Serreze_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Screen_and_Simmonds_2010}) but contrary to an earlier study that suggested a larger warming aloft ({cite.12.'Graversen_et_al_2008}). The discrepancy in observed vertical structure may reflect inadequacies in data sets ({cite.12.'Bitz_and_Fu_2008}; {cite.12.'Grant_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Thorne_2008}) and sensitivity to the time period used for averaging (see also {Box_2_3 Box 2.3}).

As also discussed in {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, there are many mechanisms that contribute to Arctic amplification, some of which were identified in early modelling studies ({cite.12.'Manabe_and_Stouffer_1980}). Feedbacks associated with changes in {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} and snow amplify surface warming near the poles ({cite.12.'Hall_2004}; {cite.12.'Soden_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Graversen_and_Wang_2009}; {cite.12.'Kumar_et_al_2010}). The {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation} changes in the top of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} associated with surface warming opposes surface warming at all latitudes, but less so in the Arctic ({cite.12.'Winton_2006a}; {cite.12.'Soden_et_al_2008}). Rising temperature globally is expected to increase the horizontal latent heat transport by the atmosphere into the Arctic ({cite.12.'Flannery_1984}; {cite.12.'Alexeev_et_al_2005}; {cite.12.'Cai_2005}; {cite.12.'Langen_and_Alexeev_2007}; {cite.12.'Kug_et_al_2010}), which warms primarily the lower troposphere. On average, CMIP3 models simulate enhanced latent heat transport ({cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006}), but north of about 65°N, the sensible heat transport declines enough to more than offset the latent heat transport increase ({cite.12.'Hwang_et_al_2011}). Increased atmospheric heat transport into the Arctic and subsidence warming has been associated with a {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} driven by enhanced {Glossary.*Convection convection} in the tropical western Pacific ({cite.12.'Lee_et_al_2011}). Ocean heat transport plays a role in the simulated Arctic amplification, with both large late 20th century transport ({cite.12.'Mahlstein_and_Knutti_2011}) and increases over the 21st century ({cite.12.'Hwang_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Bitz_et_al_2012}) associated with higher amplification. As noted by {cite.12.'Held_and_Soden_2006 Held and Soden (2006)}, {cite.12.'Kay_et_al_2012 Kay et al. (2012)}, and {cite.12.'Alexeev_and_Jackson_2012 Alexeev and Jackson (2012)}, diagnosing the role of various factors in amplified warming is complicated by coupling in the system in which local feedbacks interact with poleward heat transports.

Although models consistently exhibit Arctic amplification as global mean temperatures rise, the multitude of physical processes described above mean that they differ considerably in the magnitude. Previous work has implicated variations across {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} in numerous factors including inversion strength (Boé et al., 2009a), ocean heat transport ({cite.12.'Holland_and_Bitz_2003}; {cite.12.'Mahlstein_and_Knutti_2011}), {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({cite.12.'Winton_2006a}), longwave radiative feedbacks ({cite.12.'Winton_2006a}) and shortwave {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} ({cite.12.'Crook_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Kay_et_al_2012}) as playing a role in the across-model scatter in polar amplification. The magnitude of amplification is generally higher in models with less extensive late 20th century sea ice in June, suggesting that the initial ice state influences the 21st century Arctic amplification. The pattern of simulated Arctic warming is also associated with the initial ice state, and in particular with the location of the winter sea ice edge ({cite.12.'Holland_and_Bitz_2003}; Räisänen, 2007; {cite.12.'Bracegirdle_and_Stephenson_2012}). This relationship has been suggested as a constraint on {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} Arctic warming ({cite.12.'Abe_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Bracegirdle_and_Stephenson_2012}), although, in general, the ability of models to reproduce observed climate and its trends is not a sufficient condition for attributing high confidence to the {Glossary.*Projection projection} of future trends (see {Chapters.9.9_8 Section 9.8}).

Minima in surface warming occur in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans under transient forcing in part due to deep ocean mixed layers in those regions ({cite.12.'Manabe_et_al_1990}; {cite.12.'Xie_et_al_2010}). {cite.12.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010 Trenberth and Fasullo (2010)} find that the large biases in the Southern Ocean {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} in CMIP3 coupled models negatively correlate with equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_3 Section 12.5.3}), suggesting that an improved mean state in the Southern Ocean is needed before warming there can be understood. In the equatorial Pacific, warming is enhanced in a narrow band which previous assessments have described as ‘El Niño-like’, as may be expected from the projected decrease in atmospheric tropical circulations (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4 Section 12.4.4}). However, {cite.12.'DiNezio_et_al_2009 DiNezio et al. (2009)} highlight that the tropical Pacific warming in the CMIP3 models is not ‘El Niño-like’ as the pattern of warming and associated teleconnections ({cite.12.'Xie_et_al_2010}; {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5.12_4_5_2 Section 12.4.5.2}) is quite distinct from that of an El Niño event. Instead the pattern is of enhanced equatorial warming and is due to a meridional minimum in evaporative damping on the equator ({cite.12.'Liu_et_al_2005}) and ocean dynamical changes that can be decoupled from atmospheric changes ({cite.12.'DiNezio_et_al_2009}) (see also further discussion in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_7 Section 12.4.7}).

In summary, there is robust evidence over multiple generations of models and high confidence in these large-scale warming patterns. In the absence of a strong reduction in the Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation Meridional Overturning Circulation} (AMOC), there is very high confidence that the Arctic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} is projected to warm most.
