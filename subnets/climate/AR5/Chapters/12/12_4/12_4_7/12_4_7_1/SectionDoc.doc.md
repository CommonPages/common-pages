title: 12.4.7.1 - Sea Surface Temperature, Salinity and Ocean Heat Content

Projected increase of {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} and heat content over the next two decades is relatively insensitive to the {Topics.*Emissions emissions} trajectory. However, projected outcomes diverge as the 21st century progresses. When SSTs increase as a result of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing}, the interior water masses respond to the integrated signal at the surface, which is then propagated down to greater depth ({cite.12.'Gleckler_et_al_2006}; {cite.12.'Gregory_2010}). Changes in globally averaged ocean heat content currently account for about 90% of the change in global energy inventory since 1970 (see {Box_3_1 Box 3.1}). Heat is transported within the interior of the ocean by its large-scale {Glossary.*General_circulation general circulation} and by smaller-scale mixing processes. Changes in transports lead to redistribution of existing heat content and can cause local cooling even though the global mean heat content is rising ({cite.12.'Banks_and_Gregory_2006}; {cite.12.'Lowe_and_Gregory_2006}; {cite.12.'Xie_and_Vallis_2012}).

{'Figure_12_12 Figure 12.12} shows the multi-model mean {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of zonally averaged ocean temperature change under three emission {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. The differences in projected ocean temperature changes for different {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} manifest themselves more markedly as the century progresses. The largest warming is found in the top few hundred metres of the subtropical gyres, similar to the observed pattern of ocean temperature changes ({cite.12.'Levitus_et_al_2012}, see also {Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}). Surface warming varies considerably between the emission scenarios ranging from about 1°C ({Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}) to more than 3°C in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}. Mixing and {Glossary.*Advection advection} processes gradually transfer the additional heat to deeper levels of about 2000 m at the end of the 21st century. Depending on the {Glossary.*Emission_scenario emission scenario}, global ocean warming between 0.5°C (RCP2.6) and 1.5°C (RCP8.5) will reach a depth of about 1 km by the end of the century. The strongest warming signal is found at the surface in subtropical and tropical regions. At depth the warming is most pronounced in the Southern Ocean. From an energy point of view, for RCP4.5 by the end of the 21st century, half of the energy taken up by the ocean is in the uppermost 700 m, and 85% is in the uppermost 2000 m.

In addition to the upper-level warming, the patterns are further characterized by a slight cooling in parts of the northern midand high latitudes below 1000 m and a pronounced heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} in the deep Southern Ocean at the end of the 21st century. The cooling may be linked to the projected decrease of the strength of the AMOC (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_7.12_4_7_2 Section 12.4.7.2}; 13.4.1; {cite.12.'Banks_and_Gregory_2006}).

The response of ocean temperatures to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} comprises mainly two time scales: a relatively fast adjustment of the ocean mixed layer and the slow response of the deep ocean ({cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_1985}; {cite.12.'Knutti_et_al_2008a}; {cite.12.'Held_et_al_2010}). Simulations with coupled ocean– {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} suggest time-scales of several millennia until the deep ocean is in equilibrium with the external forcing ({cite.12.'Stouffer_2004}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Li_et_al_2013a}). Thus, the long time-scale of the ocean response to external forcing implies an additional commitment to warming for many centuries when GHG emissions are decreased or concentrations kept constant (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_2 Section 12.5.2}). Further assessment of ocean heat uptake and its relationship to projections of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise is presented in {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_1 Section 13.4.1}.

{cite.12.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010 Durack and Wijffels (2010)} and {cite.12.'Durack_et_al_2012 Durack et al. (2012)} examined trends in global sea surface salinity (SSS) changes over the period 1950– 2008. Their analysis revealed strong, spatially coherent trends in SSS over much of the global ocean, with a pattern that bears striking resemblance to the climatological SSS field and is associated with an intensification of the global {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} (see Sections {Chapters.3.3_3.3_3_2.3_3_2_1 3.3.2.1}, {Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_2 10.4.2} and {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5 12.4.5}). The CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} projections available suggest that high SSS subtropical regions that are dominated by net evaporation are typically getting more saline; lower SSS regions at high latitudes are typically getting fresher. They also suggest a continuation of this {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the Atlantic where subtropical surface waters become more saline as the century progresses ({'Figure_12_34 Figure 12.34}) (see also {cite.12.'Terray_et_al_2012}). At the same time, the North Pacific is projected to become less saline.
