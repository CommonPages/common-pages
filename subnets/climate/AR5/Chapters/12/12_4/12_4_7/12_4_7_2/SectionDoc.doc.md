title: 12.4.7.2 - Atlantic Meridional Overturning

Almost all {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} reveal an increase of high latitude temperature and high latitude precipitation ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}). Both of these effects tend to make the high latitude surface waters lighter and hence increase their stability. As seen in {'Figure_12_35 Figure 12.35}, all models show a weakening of the AMOC over the course of the 21st century (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_2 Section 12.5.5.2} for further analysis). Projected changes in the strength of the AMOC at high latitudes appear stronger in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) CM2.1 when density is used as a vertical coordinate instead of depth ({cite.12.'Zhang_2010a}). Once the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} is stabilized, the AMOC recovers, but in some models to less than its pre-industrial level. The recovery may include a significant overshoot (i.e., a weaker circulation may persist) if the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} RF is eliminated ({cite.12.'Wu_et_al_2011a}). {cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2005 Gregory et al. (2005)} found that for all eleven models analysed (six from CMIP2/3 and five {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs}), the AMOC reduction was caused more by changes in surface heat flux than changes in surface freshwater flux. They further found that models with a stronger AMOC in their control run exhibited a larger weakening (see also {cite.12.'Gregory_and_Tailleux_2011}).

Based on the assessment of the CMIP5 RCP simulations and on our understanding gleaned from analysis of CMIP3 models, observations and our understanding of physical mechanisms, it is very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century. Best estimates and ranges for the reduction from CMIP5 are 11% (1 to 24%) in {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} and 34% (12 to 54%) in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}. There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the AMOC beyond the 21st century.
