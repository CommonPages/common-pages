title: 12.4.2.2 - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Patterns Scaled by Global Average Temperature Change

On the basis of CMIP5 simulations, we show geographical patterns ({'Figure_12_10 Figure 12.10}) of warming and precipitation change and indicate measures of their variability across models and across {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}. The patterns are scaled to 1°C global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} change above the reference period 1986–2005 for 2081–2100 (first row) and for a period of approximate stable temperature, 2181–2200 (thus excluding {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}, which does not stabilize by that time) (second row). Spatial correlation of fields of temperature and precipitation change range from 0.93 to 0.99 when considering {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} means under different RCPs. The lower values are found when computing correlation between {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} and the higher RCPs, and may be related to the high {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} enacted under RCP2.6 from early in the 21st century. Pattern correlation varies between 0.91 and 0.98 for temperature and between 0.91 and 0.96 for precipitation when comparing patterns computed by averaging and normalizing changes at the end of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd centuries, with the largest value representing the correlation between the patterns at the end of the 22nd and 23rd centuries, the lowest representing the correlation between the pattern at the end of the 21st and the pattern at the end of the 23rd century. The zonal means shown to the side of each plot represent each model by one line, colour coding the four different {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. They show good agreement of models and scenarios over low and mid-latitudes for temperature, but higher spread across models and especially across scenarios for the areas subject to polar amplification, for which the previous discussion about the sensitivity of the patterns to the {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} edge may be relevant. A comparison of the mean of the lines to their spread indicates overall the presence of a strong mean signal with respect to the spread of the ensemble. Precipitation shows an opposite pattern of inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread}, with larger variations in the low latitudes and around the equator, and smaller around the high latitudes. Precipitation has also a lower signal-to-noise ratio (measured as above by comparing the ensemble mean change magnitude to the spread across models and scenarios of these zonal mean averages).

As already mentioned, although we do not explicitly use pattern scaling in the sections that follow, we consider it a useful approximation when the need emerges to interpolate or extrapolate results to different scenarios or time periods, noting the possibility that the scaling may break down at higher levels of global warming, and that the validity of the approximation is limited to broad patterns of change, as opposed to local scales. An important caveat is that pattern scaling only applies to the {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} that is externally forced. The actual response is a combination of forced change and natural variability, which is not and should not be scaled up or down by the application of this technique, which becomes important on small spatial scales and shorter time scales, and whose relative magnitude compared to the forced component also depends on the variable ({cite.12.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2009}, 2011; {cite.12.'Mahlstein_et_al_2011}; {cite.12.'Deser_et_al_2012a}, 2012b; {cite.12.'Mahlstein_et_al_2012}) (see {Chapters.11.11_2 Section 11.2}). One approach to produce {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} that include both components is to estimate natural variability separately, scale the forced response and add the two.
