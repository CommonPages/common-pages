title: 12.4.6.2 - Changes in Snow Cover and Frozen Ground

Excluding ice sheets and glaciers, analyses of seasonal snow cover changes generally focus on the NH, where the configuration of the continents on the Earth induces a larger maximum seasonal {Glossary.*Snow_cover_extent snow cover extent} (SCE) and a larger sensitivity of SCE to climate changes. Seasonal snow cover extent and snow water equivalent ({Glossary.*Snow_water_equivalent SWE}) respond to both temperature and precipitation. At the beginning and the end of the snow season, SCE decreases are closely linked to a shortening of the seasonal snow cover duration, while SWE is more sensitive to snowfall amount ({cite.12.'Brown_and_Mote_2009}). Future widespread reductions of SCE, particularly in spring, are simulated by the CMIP3 models ({cite.12.'Roesch_2006}; {cite.12.'Brown_and_Mote_2009}) and confirmed by the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013). The NH spring (March-April average) snow cover area changes are coherent in the CMIP5 models although there is considerable scatter. Relative to the 1986–2005 reference period, the CMIP5 models simulate a weak decrease of about 7 ± 4% (one-σ inter-model dispersion) for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} during the last two decades of the 21st century, while SCE decreases of about 13 ± 4% are simulated for RCP4.5, 15 ± 5% for RCP6.0, and 25 ± 8% for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} ({'Figure_12_32 Figure 12.32}). There is medium confidence in these numbers because of the considerable inter-model scatter mentioned above and because snow processes in global climate models are strongly simplified.

Projections for the change in annual maximum SWE are more mixed. Warming decreases SWE both by reducing the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow and by increasing snowmelt, but projected increases in precipitation over much of the northern high latitudes during winter months act to increase snow amounts. Whether snow covering the ground will become thicker or thinner depends on the balance between these competing factors. Both in the CMIP3 (Räisänen, 2008) and in the CMIP5 models (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013), annual maximum SWE tends to increase or only marginally decrease in the coldest regions, while annual maximum SWE decreases are strong closer to the southern limit of the seasonally snow-covered area.

It is thus very likely (high confidence) that by the end of the 21st century, NH spring snow cover extent will be substantially lower than today if {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} is similar to the stronger {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} considered here. Conversely, there is only medium confidence in the latitudinal pattern of annual maximum SWE changes (increase or little change in the coldest regions, stronger decrease further to the South) because annual maximum SWE is influenced by competing factors (earlier melt onset, higher solid precipitation rates in some regions).

The strong projected warming across the northern high latitudes in climate model simulations has implications for {Glossary.*Frozen_ground frozen ground}. Recent {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the extent of {Glossary.*Near_surface_permafrost near-surface permafrost} (see Glossary) degradation continue to vary widely depending on the underlying climate forcing scenario and model physics, but virtually all of them indicate substantial near-surface permafrost degradation and thaw depth deepening over much of the permafrost area ({cite.12.'Saito_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Lawrence_et_al_2008a}, 2012; {cite.12.'Koven_et_al_2011}, 2013; {cite.12.'Eliseev_et_al_2013}; {cite.12.'Slater_and_Lawrence_2013}). {Glossary.*Permafrost Permafrost} at greater depths is less directly relevant to the surface energy and water balance, and its degradation naturally occurs much more slowly ({cite.12.'Delisle_2007}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} are beginning to represent permafrost physical processes and properties more accurately ({cite.12.'Alexeev_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Nicolsky_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Lawrence_et_al_2008a}; {cite.12.'Rinke_et_al_2008}; {cite.12.'Koven_et_al_2009}; {cite.12.'Gouttevin_et_al_2012}), but there are large disagreements in the calculation of current frozen soil extent and {Glossary.*Active_layer active layer} depth due to differences in the land model physics in the CMIP5 ensemble ({cite.12.'Koven_et_al_2013}). The projected changes in permafrost are a response not only to warming, but also to changes in snow conditions because snow properties and their seasonal evolution exert significant control on soil thermal state ({cite.12.'Zhang_2005}; {cite.12.'Lawrence_and_Slater_2010}; {cite.12.'Shkolnik_et_al_2010}; {cite.12.'Koven_et_al_2013}). Applying the surface frost index method ({cite.12.'Nelson_and_Outcalt_1987}) to coupled climate model anomalies from the CMIP5 models ({cite.12.'Slater_and_Lawrence_2013}) yields a reduction of the diagnosed 2080–2099 near-surface permafrost area (continuous plus discontinuous near-surface permafrost) by 37 ± 11% (RCP2.6), 51 ± 13% (RCP4.5), 58 ± 13% (RCP6.0), and 81±12% (RCP8.5), compared to the 1986–2005 diagnosed near-surface permafrost area, with medium confidence in the numbers as such because of the strongly simplified soil physical processes in current-generation global climate models ({'Figure_12_33 Figure 12.33}). The {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range given here is the 1-σ inter-model dispersion. Applying directly the model output to diagnose permafrost extent and its changes over the 21st century yields similar relative changes ({cite.12.'Koven_et_al_2013}). In summary, based on high agreement across CMIP5 and older model projections, fundamental process understanding, and paleoclimatic evidence (e.g., {cite.12.'Vaks_et_al_2013}), it appears virtually certain (high confidence) that near-surface permafrost extent will shrink as global climate warms. However, the amplitude of the projected reductions of near-surface permafrost extent not only depends on the {Topics.*Emissions emission} scenario and the global climate model response, but also very much on the permafrost-related soil processes taken into account in the models.
