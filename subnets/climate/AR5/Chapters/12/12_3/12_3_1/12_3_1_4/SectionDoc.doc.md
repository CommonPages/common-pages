title: 12.3.1.4 - Comparison of Special Report on Emission Scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios

The four RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} used in CMIP5 lead to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} values that range from 2.3 to 8.0 W m–2 at 2100, a wider range than that of the three {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} used in CMIP3 which vary from 4.2 to 8.1 W m–2 at 2100 (see Table AII.6.8 and {'Figure_12_3 Figure 12.3}). The SRES scenarios do not assume any policy to control climate change, unlike the RCP scenarios. The RF of {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} is hence lower by 1.9 W m–2 than the three SRES scenarios and very close to the ENSEMBLES E1 scenario ({cite.12.'Johns_et_al_2011}). RCP4.5 and SRES B1 have similar RF at 2100, and comparable time evolution (within 0.2 W m–2). The RF of SRES A2 is lower than {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} throughout the 21st century, mainly due to a faster decline in the {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} of aerosols in RCP8.5 than SRES A2, but they converge to within 0.1 W m–2 at 2100. RCP6.0 lies in between SRES B1 and SRES A1B. Results obtained with one General Circulation Model ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM}) ({cite.12.'Dufresne_et_al_2013}) and with a reduced-complexity model ({cite.12.'Rogelj_et_al_2012}) confirm that the differences in temperature responses are consistent with the differences in RFs estimates. RCP2.6, which assumes strong {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} action, yields a smaller temperature increase than any SRES scenario. The temperature increase with the RCP4.5 and SRES B1 scenarios are close and the temperature increase is larger with RCP8.5 than with SRES A2. The spread of projected {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature} for the RCP scenarios ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_1 Section 12.4.1}) is considerably larger (at both the high and low response ends) than for the three SRES scenarios used in CMIP3 (B1, A1B and A2) as a direct consequence of the larger range of RF across the RCP scenarios compared to that across the three SRES scenarios (see analysis of SRES versus RCP global temperature {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_9 Section 12.4.9} and {'Figure_12_40 Figure 12.40}).
