title: 12.3.1 - Description of Scenarios

Long-term climate change {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} reflect how {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities} or natural effects could alter the climate over decades and centuries. In this context, defined {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} are important, as using specific time series of {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, land use, atmospheric concentrations or {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} across multiple models allows for coherent {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} intercomparisons and synthesis. Some scenarios present a simple stylized future (not accompanied by a socioeconomic {Glossary.*Storyline storyline}) and are used for process understanding. More comprehensive scenarios are produced by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) as internally consistent sets of emissions and socioeconomic assumptions (e.g., regarding population and socioeconomic development) with the aim of presenting several plausible future worlds (see {Chapters.1.1_5.1_5_2 Section 1.5.2} and {Box_1_1 Box 1.1}). In general it is these scenarios that are used for policy relevant climate change, impact, adaptation and {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} analysis. It is beyond the scope of this report to consider the full range of currently published scenarios and their implications for mitigation policy and climate targetsâ€”that is covered by the Working Group III contribution to the AR5. Here, we focus on the RCP scenarios used within the CMIP5 intercomparison exercise (Taylor et al. 2012) along with the {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} ({cite.12.'IPCC_2000}) developed for the IPCC Third Assessment Report ({cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR}) but still widely used by the climate community.
