title: 12.3.1.1 - Stylized Concentration Scenarios

A 1% per annum compound increase of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration until a doubling or a quadrupling of its initial value has been widely used since the second phase of CMIP ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2000}) and the {cite.1.'IPCC_1996 Second Assessment Report} ({cite.12.'Kattenberg_et_al_1996}). This stylized scenario is a useful benchmark for comparing coupled model {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity}, climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} and transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}, but is not used directly for future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. The exponential increase of CO2 concentration induces approximately a linear increase in RF due to a ‘saturation effect’ of the strong absorbing bands ({cite.12.'Augustsson_and_Ramanathan_1977}; {cite.12.'Hansen_et_al_1988}; {cite.12.'Myhre_et_al_1998}). Thus, a linear ramp function in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} results from these stylized pathways, adding to their suitability for comparative diagnostics of the models’ climate feedbacks and inertia. The CMIP5 intercomparison project again includes such a stylized pathway, in which the CO2 concentration reaches twice the initial concentration after 70 years and four times the initial concentration after 140 years. The corresponding RFs are 3.7 W m–2 ({cite.12.'Ramaswamy_et_al_2001}) and 7.4 W m–2 respectively with a range of ±20% accounting for {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in radiative transfer calculations and rapid adjustments (see {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_2.8_3_2_1 Section 8.3.2.1}), placing them within the range of the RFs at the end of the 21st century for the future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} presented below. The CMIP5 project also includes a second stylized experiment in which the CO2 concentration is quadrupled instantaneously, which allows a distinction between effective RFs and longer-term climate feedbacks ({cite.12.'Gregory_et_al_2004}).
