title: 12.3.3 - Synthesis of Projected Global Mean Radiative Forcing for the 21st Century

Quantification of future global mean RF is of interest as it is directly related to changes in the global {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} of the climate system and resultant climate change. {Chapters.8 Chapter 8} discusses RF concepts and methods for computing it that form the basis of analysis directly from the output of model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}.

We assess three related estimates of projected global mean forcing and its range through the 21st century in the context of forcing estimated for the recent past ({'Figure_12_4 Figure 12.4}). The estimates used are: the total forcings for the defined RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, harmonized to RF in the past ({cite.12.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011a}; Meinshausen et al., 2011c); the total effective {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF}) estimated from CMIP5 models through the 21st century for the four RCP experiments ({cite.12.'Forster_et_al_2013}); and that estimated from models in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project (ACCMIP; {cite.12.'Lamarque_et_al_2013}—see {Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_2 Section 8.2.2} ) for RCP time-slice experiments ({cite.12.'Shindell_et_al_2013b}). Methodological differences mean that whereas CMIP5 estimates include both natural and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcings based entirely on ERF, ACCMIP estimates anthropogenic composition forcing only (neglecting forcing changes due to natural, i.e., solar and volcanic, and land use factors) based on a combination of ERF for aerosols and RF for {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} (see {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_3 Section 8.5.3}). Note also that total forcing for the defined RCP scenarios is based on Meinshausen et al. (2011c) but combining total anthropogenic ERF (allowing for efficacies of the various anthropogenic forcings as in {'Figure_12_3 Figure 12.3}) with natural (solar and volcanic) RF.

The CMIP5 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean ERF at 2100 (relative to an 1850–1869 base period) is 2.2, 3.8, 4.8 and 7.6 W m–2 respectively for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} concentration-driven projections, with a 1-σ range based on annual mean data for year 2100 of about ±0.5 to 1.0 W m–2 depending on scenario (lowest for RCP2.6 and highest for RCP8.5). The CMIP5-based ERF estimates are close to the total forcing at 2100 (relative to an 1850–1859 base period) of 2.4, 4.0, 5.2 and 8.0 W m–2 as defined for the four {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}.

The spread in ERF indicated from CMIP5 model results with specified GHG concentration pathways is broadly consistent with that found for CMIP3 models for the A1B scenario using the corresponding method ({cite.12.'Forster_and_Taylor_2006}). As for CMIP3 models, part of the forcing spread in CMIP5 models ({cite.12.'Forster_et_al_2013}) is consistent with differences in GHG forcings arising from the radiative transfer codes ({cite.12.'Collins_et_al_2006b}). {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} forcing implementations in CMIP5 models also vary considerably, however ({Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_2 Section 12.3.2}), leading to a spread in aerosol concentrations and forcings which contributes to the overall {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread}. A further small {Glossary.*Source source} of spread in CMIP5 results possibly arises from an underlying ambiguity in the CMIP5 experimental design regarding the volcanic forcing offset between the historical experiment versus the pre-industrial control experiment. Most models implement zero volcanic forcing in the control experiment but some use constant negative forcing equal to the time-mean of historical volcanic forcing (see {'Table_12_1 Table 12.1} and {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_2 Section 12.3.2}). The effect of this volcanic forcing offset persists into the future projections.

ACCMIP projected forcing at 2030 (for RCP8.5) and 2100 (all RCPs) is systematically higher than corresponding CMIP5 ERF, although with some overlap between 1-σ ranges. CMIP5 and ACCMIP comprise different sets of models and they are related in many but not all cases ({Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_2 Section 8.2.2}). Confining analysis to a subset of closely related models also gives higher forcing estimates from ACCMIP compared to CMIP5 so the discrepancy in multi-model ensemble mean forcings appears unrelated to the different model samples associated with the two methods of estimation. The discrepancy is thought to originate mostly from differences in the underlying methodologies used to estimate RF, but is not yet well understood (see also {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_3 Section 8.5.3}).

There is high confidence in projections from ACCMIP models ({cite.12.'Shindell_et_al_2013b}) based on the GISS-E2 CMIP5 simulations ({cite.12.'Shindell_et_al_2013a}) and an earlier study with a version of the HadGEM2-ES model related to that used in CMIP5 ({cite.12.'Bellouin_et_al_2011}), consistent with understanding of the processes controlling nitrate formation ({cite.12.'Adams_et_al_2001}), that nitrate aerosols (which provide a negative forcing) will increase substantially over the 21st century under the RCPs ({Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_3 Section 8.5.3}, {'Figure_8_20 Figure 8.20}). The magnitude of total aerosol-related forcing (also negative in sign) will therefore tend to be underestimated in the CMIP5 multi-model mean ERF, as nitrate aerosol has been omitted as a forcing from almost all CMIP5 models.

Natural RF variations are, by their nature, difficult to project reliably (see {Chapters.8.8_4 Section 8.4}). There is very high confidence that Industrial Era natural forcing has been a small fraction of the (positive) anthropogenic forcing except for brief periods following large volcanic eruptions (Sections {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_1 8.5.1} and {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_2 8.5.2}). Based on that assessment and the assumption that variability in natural forcing remains of a similar magnitude and character to that over the Industrial Era, total anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial, for any of the RCP scenarios through the 21st century, is very likely to be greater in magnitude than changes in natural (solar plus volcanic) forcing on decadal time scales.

In summary, global mean forcing projections derived from {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} exhibit a substantial range for the given RCP scenarios in concentration-driven experiments, contributing to the projected {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature} range ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_1 Section 12.4.1}). Forcings derived from ACCMIP models for 2100 are systematically higher than those estimated from CMIP5 models for reasons that are not fully understood but are partly due to methodological differences. The multi-model mean estimate of combined anthropogenic plus natural forcing from CMIP5 is consistent with indicative RCP forcing values at 2100 to within 0.2 to 0.4 W m–2.
