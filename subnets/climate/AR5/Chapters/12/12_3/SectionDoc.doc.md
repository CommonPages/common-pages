title: 12.3 - Projected Changes in Forcing Agents, Including Emissions and Concentrations

The experiments that form the basis of global future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} discussed in this chapter are extensions of the simulations of the observational record discussed in Chapters {Chapters.9} and {Chapters.10}. The {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} assessed in AR5, introduced in {Chapters.1 Chapter 1}, include four new scenarios designed to explore a wide range of future climate characterized by representative trajectories of well-mixed {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} ({Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG}) concentrations and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} agents. These are described further in {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_1 Section 12.3.1}. The implementation of forcing agents in model projections, including natural and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} aerosols, {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_2 Section 12.3.2}, with a strong focus on CMIP5 experiments. Global mean {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, concentrations and RFs applicable to the historical record simulations assessed in Chapters {Chapters.8}, {Chapters.9} and {Chapters.10}, and the future scenario simulations assessed here, are listed in Annex II. Global mean RF for the 21st century consistent with these scenarios, derived from CMIP5 and other {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} studies, is discussed in {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_3 Section 12.3.3}.
