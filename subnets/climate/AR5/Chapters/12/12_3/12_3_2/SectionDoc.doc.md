title: 12.3.2 - Implementation of Forcings in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Experiments

The CMIP5 experimental protocol for long-term transient climate experiments prescribes a common basis for a comprehensive set of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} agents acting as boundary conditions in three experimental phases—historical, {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} and ECPs ({cite.12.'Taylor_et_al_2012}). To permit common implementations of this set of forcing agents in CMIP5 models, self-consistent forcing data time series have been computed and provided to participating models (see Sections {Chapters.9.9_3.9_3_2.9_3_2_2 9.3.2.2} and {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_1.12_3_1_3 12.3.1.3}) comprising {Topics.*Emissions emissions} or concentrations of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and related compounds, {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and atmospheric aerosols and their chemical {Glossary.*Precursors precursors}, and {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}.

The forcing agents implemented in {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models} (AOGCMs) and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} used to make long-term climate {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} in CMIP5 are summarized in {'Table_12_1 Table 12.1}. The number of CMIP5 models listed here is about double the number of CMIP3 models listed in Table 10.1 of {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}).

Natural forcings (arising from solar variability and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} emissions via volcanic activity) are also specified elements in the CMIP5 experimental protocol, but their future time evolutions are not prescribed very precisely. A repeated 11-year cycle for total solar irradiance ({cite.12.'Lean_and_Rind_2009}) is suggested for future projections but the periodicity is not specified precisely as solar cycles vary in length. Some models include the effect of orbital variations as well, but most do not. For volcanic eruptions, no specific CMIP5 prescription is given for future emissions or concentration data, the general recommendation being that volcanic aerosols should either be omitted entirely both from the control experiment and future projections or the same background volcanic aerosols should be prescribed in both. This provides a consistent framework for {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison model intercomparison} given a lack of knowledge of when future large eruptions will occur. In general models have adhered to this guidance, but there are variations in the background volcanic aerosol levels chosen (zero or an average volcano background in general) and some cases, for example, Australian Community Climate and {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Simulator (ACCESS)1.0 and ACCESS1.3 ({cite.12.'Dix_et_al_2013}), where the background volcanic aerosol in future differs significantly from that in the control experiment, with a small effect on future RF.

For the other natural aerosols (dust, sea-salt, etc.), no emission or concentration data are recommended. The emissions are potentially computed interactively by the models themselves and may change with climate, or prescribed from separate model simulations carried out in the implementation of CMIP5 experiments, or simply held constant. Natural aerosols (mineral dust and sea salt) are in a few cases prescribed with no year-to-year variation (giving no transient forcing effect), in some cases prescribed from data sets computed off-line as described above, and in other cases calculated interactively via prognostic or diagnostic calculations. The degree to which natural aerosol emissions are interactive is effectively greater in some such models than others, however, as mineral dust emissions are more constrained when land vegetation cover is specified (e.g., as in Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-Mk3.6.0) ({cite.12.'Rotstayn_et_al_2012}) than when vegetation is allowed to evolve dynamically (e.g., as in Hadley Centre new Global Environmental Model 2-ES (HadGEM2-ES)) ({cite.12.'Jones_et_al_2011}) (Table 9.A.1).
