title: 12.3.2.1 - ‘Emissions-Driven’ versus ‘Concentration Driven’ Experiments

A novel feature within the CMIP5 experimental design is that experiments with prescribed {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} are included in addition to classical experiments with prescribed concentration pathways for {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} ({cite.12.'Taylor_et_al_2012}). The essential features of these two classes of experiment are described in {Box_6_4 Box 6.4}. The CMIP5 protocol includes experiments in which ‘{Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs}’ (models possessing at least a carbon cycle, allowing for interactive calculation of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} or {Glossary.*Compatible_emissions compatible emissions}) and {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} (that do not possess such an interactive carbon cycle) are both forced with {Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG} concentration pathways to derive a range of climate responses consistent with those pathways from the two types of model. The range of climate responses including climate–carbon cycle feedbacks can additionally be explored in ESMs driven with emissions rather than concentrations, analogous to Coupled Climate {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle Carbon Cycle} {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project (C4MIP) experiments ({cite.12.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006})—see {Box_6_4 Box 6.4}. Results from the two types of experiment cannot be compared directly, but they provide complementary information. Uncertainties in the forward {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} driven with specified emissions or concentrations can be derived from all participating models, while concentration-driven ESM experiments also permit a policy-relevant diagnosis of the range of anthropogenic carbon emissions compatible with the imposed concentration pathways ({cite.12.'Hibbard_et_al_2007}; {cite.12.'Moss_et_al_2010}).

WMGHG {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} implementations in CMIP5 concentration-driven experiments conform closely in almost all cases to the standard protocol ({'Table_12_1 Table 12.1}; CO2, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)), imposing an effective control over the RF due to WMGHGs across the multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}, apart from the {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} arising from radiative transfer codes ({cite.12.'Collins_et_al_2006b}; {cite.12.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}). The ability of ESMs to determine their own WMGHG concentrations in emissions-driven experiments means that RF due to WMGHGs is less tightly controlled in such experiments. Even in concentration-driven experiments, many models implement some emissions-driven forcing agents (more often aerosols, but also {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} in some cases), leading to a potentially greater spread in both the concentrations and hence RF of those emissions-driven agents.
