title: 12.3.2 - Implementation of Forcings in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Experiments
section 12_3_2

  |The CMIP5 experimental protocol for long-term transient climate experiments prescribes a common basis for a comprehensive set of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} agents acting as boundary conditions in three experimental phasesâ€”historical, {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} and ECPs. A novel feature within the CMIP5 experimental design is that experiments with prescribed {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} are included in addition to classical experiments with prescribed concentration pathways for {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}. Apart from the distinction between concentration-driven and emissions-driven protocols, a number of variations are present in the implementation of forcing agents listed in {'Table_12_1 Table 12.1}.
