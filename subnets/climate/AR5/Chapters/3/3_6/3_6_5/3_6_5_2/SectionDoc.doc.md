title: 3.6.5.2 - The Antarctic Circumpolar Current

There is medium confidence that the westerly winds in the Southern Ocean have increased since the early 1980s ({Chapters.3.3_4.3_4_4 Section 3.4.4}), associated with a positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} ({cite.3.'Marshall_2003}); also see Sections {Chapters.3.3_4.3_4_4 3.4.4} and {Chapters.3.3_6.3_6_3 3.6.3}). Although a few observational studies have found evidence for correlation between SAM and ACC transport on subseasonal to interannual scales (e.g., {cite.3.'Hughes_et_al_2003}; {cite.3.'Meredith_et_al_2004}), there is no significant observational evidence of an increase in ACC transport associated with the multi-decadal trend in wind {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} over the Southern Ocean. Repeat hydrographic sections spread unevenly over 35 years in Drake Passage (e.g., {cite.3.'Cunningham_et_al_2003}; {cite.3.'Koshlyakov_et_al_2007}, 2011; {cite.3.'Gladyshev_et_al_2008}), south of Africa ({cite.3.'Swart_et_al_2008}) and south of Australia ({cite.3.'Rintoul_et_al_2002}) reveal moderate variability but no significant trends in these sparse and discontinuous records. A comparison of recent Argo data and a long-term climatology showed that the slope of density surfaces (hence baroclinic transport) associated with the ACC had not changed in recent decades (Böning et al., 2008). Eddy-resolving models suggest the ACC transport is relatively insensitive to trends in wind forcing, consistent with the ACC being in an “eddy-saturated” state where increases in wind forcing are compensated by changes in the eddy field ({cite.3.'Hallberg_and_Gnanadesikan_2006}; {cite.3.'Farneti_et_al_2010}; {cite.3.'Spence_et_al_2010}). While there is limited evidence for (or against) multi-decadal changes in transport of the ACC, observations of changes in temperature, salinity and SSH indicate the current system has shifted poleward (medium confidence) (Böning et al., 2008; {cite.3.'Gille_2008}; {cite.3.'Morrow_et_al_2008}; {cite.3.'Sokolov_and_Rintoul_2009}; {cite.3.'Kazmin_2012}).
