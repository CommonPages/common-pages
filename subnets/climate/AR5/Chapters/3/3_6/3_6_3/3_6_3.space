title: 3.6.3 - The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
section 3_6_3

  |The Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation Meridional Overturning Circulation} (AMOC) is responsible for most of the meridional transport of heat and carbon by the mid-latitude NH ocean and associated with the production of about half of the global oceanâ€™s deep waters in the northern North Atlantic. The observational record of AMOC variability is short, and there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of change in the transport of the AMOC.
