title: 3.1 - Introduction

The ocean influences climate by storing and transporting large amounts of heat, freshwater, and carbon, and by exchanging these properties with the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. About 93% of the excess heat energy stored by the Earth over the last 50 years is found in the ocean ({cite.3.'Church_et_al_2011}; {cite.3.'Levitus_et_al_2012}). The ability of the ocean to store vast amounts of heat reflects the large mass and heat capacity of seawater relative to air and the fact that ocean circulation connects the surface and interior ocean. More than three quarters of the total exchange of water between the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and the Earth’s surface through evaporation and precipitation takes place over the oceans ({cite.3.'Schmitt_2008}). The ocean contains 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere ({cite.3.'Sabine_et_al_2004}) and is at present acting to slow the rate of climate change by absorbing about 30% of human {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of carbon dioxide ({Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}) from fossil fuel burning, cement production, {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation} and other {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} (Mikaloff-Fletcher et al., 2006; Le Quéré et al., 2010). Changes in the ocean may result in climate feedbacks that either increase or reduce the rate of climate change. Climate variability and change on time scales from seasons to millennia is therefore closely linked to the ocean and its interactions with the atmosphere and {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}. The large inertia of the oceans means that they naturally integrate over short-term variability and often provide a clearer signal of longer-term change than other components of the climate system. Observations of ocean change therefore provide a means to track the evolution of climate change, and a relevant benchmark for {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.

The lack of long-term measurements of the global ocean and changes in the observing system over time makes documenting and understanding change in the oceans a difficult challenge ({Appendix_3_A Appendix 3.A}). Many of the issues raised in {Box_2_1 Box 2.1} regarding uncertainty in atmospheric climate records are common to oceanographic data. Despite the limitations of historical records, {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} identified significant trends in a number of ocean variables relevant to climate change, including ocean heat content, sea level, regional patterns of salinity, and biogeochemical parameters ({cite.3.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}). Since AR4, substantial progress has been made in improving the quality and coverage of ocean observations. Biases in historical measurements have been identified and reduced, providing a clearer record of past change. The Argo array of profiling floats has provided near-global, year-round measurements of temperature and salinity in the upper 2000 m since 2005. The satellite {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} record is now more than 20 years in length. Longer continuous time series of important components of the {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation meridional overturning circulation} and tropical oceans have been obtained. The spatial and temporal coverage of biogeochemical measurements in the ocean has expanded. As a result of these advances, there is now stronger {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change evidence of change} in the ocean, and our understanding of the causes of ocean change is improved.

This chapter summarizes the observational evidence of change in the ocean, with an emphasis on basinand global-scale changes relevant to climate, with a focus on studies published since the AR4. As in {Chapters.2 Chapter 2}, the robustness of observed changes is assessed relative to sources of observational uncertainty. The {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of ocean change, including the degree to which observed changes are consistent with {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} climate change, is addressed in {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}. The evidence for changes in subsurface ocean temperature and heat content is assessed in {Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}; changes in sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} ({Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}) are covered in {Chapters.2 Chapter 2}. Changes in ocean heat content dominate changes in the global energy inventory ({Box_3_1 Box 3.1}). Recent studies have strengthened the evidence for regional changes in ocean salinity and their link to changes in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans ({Chapters.3.3_3 Section 3.3}), a connection already identified in AR4. Evidence for changes in the fluxes of heat, water and momentum (wind stress) across the air–sea interface is assessed in {Chapters.3.3_4 Section 3.4}. Considering ocean changes from a water-mass perspective adds additional insight into the nature and causes of ocean change ({Chapters.3.3_5 Section 3.5}). Although direct observations of ocean circulation are more limited than those of temperature and salinity, there is growing evidence of variability and change of ocean current patterns relevant to climate ({Chapters.3.3_6 Section 3.6}). Observations of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} are summarized in {Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7}; {Chapters.13 Chapter 13} builds on the evidence presented in this and other chapters to provide an overall synthesis of past and future {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change}. Biogeochemical changes in the ocean, including {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification}, are covered in {Chapters.3.3_8 Section 3.8}. {Chapters.6 Chapter 6} combines observations with models to discuss past and present changes in the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. {Chapters.3.3_9 Section 3.9} provides an overall synthesis of changes observed in the ocean during the instrumental period and highlights key {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}. Unless otherwise noted, uncertainties (in square brackets) represent 5 to 95% confidence intervals.
