title: 3.5.3.1 - Upper North Atlantic Deep Water

Upper North Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW) is formed by deep {Glossary.*Convection convection} in the Labrador Sea between Canada and Greenland, so is also known as Labrador Sea Water (LSW). It is the shallowest component of the NADW, located above the overflow water masses that supply the Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW). {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} assessed the variability in {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} properties of LSW from the 1950s. Recent studies have confirmed the large interannual-to-multi-decadeal variability of LSW properties and provided new information on variability in formation rates and the impact on heat and carbon ({Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_1 Section 3.8.1}) {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} by the deep ocean.

During the 1970s and 1980s and especially the 1990s the UNADW has been cold and fresh. In {'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}A it is the strong freshening signal from the 1960s to the 1990s that dominates the {Glossary.*Trend trend}. This freshening trend reversed in the late 1990s ({cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Holliday_et_al_2008}; see {Chapters.3.3_3.3_3_3.3_3_3_2 Section 3.3.3.2}). Estimates of the LSW formation rate3 decreased from about 7.6 to 8.9 Sv in 1997–1999 ({cite.3.'Kieke_et_al_2006}) to roughly 0.5 Sv in 2003–2005 ({cite.3.'Rhein_et_al_2011}), and since 1997, only less dense LSW was formed compared to the high {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} years before. There is, however, evidence that formation of denser LSW occurred in 2008 (Våge et al., 2009; {cite.3.'Yashayaev_and_Loder_2009}), but not in the following years ({cite.3.'Yashayaev_and_Loder_2009}; {cite.3.'Rhein_et_al_2011}).

The strong variability in the formation of UNADW affected significantly the heat transfer into the deep North Atlantic ({cite.3.'Mauritzen_et_al_2012}). Substantial heat entered the deep North Atlantic during the low NAO years of the 1960s, when salinity was large enough to compensate for the high temperatures, and dense LSW was still formed and exported to the subtropics.
