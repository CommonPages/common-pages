title: 3.5.2.2 - Antarctic Intermediate Water

In {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}, Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) was reported to have warmed and freshened since the 1960s ({'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}). In most recent studies, usually—but not always—a dipole pattern was found: on isopycnals denser than the AAIW salinity minimum, a warming and salinification was observed and on isopycnals lighter than the AAIW salinity minimum, a cooling and freshening {Glossary.*Trend trend} (Böning et al., 2008; {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.3.'Helm_et_al_2010}; {cite.3.'McCarthy_et_al_2011}). The salinity minimum core of the AAIW also underwent changes consistent with these patterns on isopycnals: In 1970–2009, south of 30°S, the AAIW salinity minimum core showed a strong, large-scale shoaling (30 to 50 dbar per decade) and warming (0.05°C to 0.15°C per decade), leading to lighter densities (up to 0.03 kg m–3 per decade), while the salinity trends varied regionally. A long-term freshening of the AAIW core is found in the southwest Atlantic, southeast Pacific, and south-central Indian oceans, with salinification south of Africa and Australia. All trends were strongest close to the AAIW formation latitude just north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ({cite.3.'Schmidtko_and_Johnson_2012}).

Both an increase in precipitation—evaporation and poleward migration of density surfaces caused by warming have likely contributed to the observed trends ({Chapters.3.3_3 Section 3.3}; Böning et al., 2008; {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.3.'Helm_et_al_2010}; {cite.3.'McCarthy_et_al_2011}). Changes in AAIW properties in particular locations have also been linked to other processes, including exchange between the Indian and Atlantic basins ({cite.3.'McCarthy_et_al_2011}) and changes in surface {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} related to modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} like {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} ({cite.3.'Garabato_et_al_2009}). Whether these changes in properties also affected the formation rates of AAIW cannot be assessed from the available observations.
