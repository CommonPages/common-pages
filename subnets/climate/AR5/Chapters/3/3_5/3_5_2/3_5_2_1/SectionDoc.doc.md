title: 3.5.2.1 - North Pacific Intermediate Water

The North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) has freshened over the last two decades ({cite.3.'Wong_et_al_1999}; {cite.3.'Nakano_et_al_2007}; {'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}g) and has warmed since the 1950s, as reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}. NPIW in the northwestern North Pacific warmed by 0.5Â°C from 1955 to 2004 and is now entering the subtropics at lower density; oxygen concentrations in the NPIW have declined, indicating weaker {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation} ({cite.3.'Nakanowatari_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Kouketsu_et_al_2010}). The strongest trends are in the Sea of Okhotsk, where NPIW is formed, and have been tentatively linked to increased air temperature and decreased sea-ice extent in winter ({cite.3.'Nakanowatari_et_al_2007}; {'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}i).
