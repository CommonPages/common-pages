title: 3.5.4 - Conclusions

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} concluded that observed changes in upper ocean water masses reflect the combination of long-term trends and interannual to decadal variability related to {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate modes} like {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} and {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}. The time series are still generally too short and incomplete to distinguish decadal variability from long-term trends, but understanding of the nature and causes of variability has improved in this assessment. The observed patterns of change in subsurface temperature and salinity (Sections {Chapters.3.3_2 3.2} and {Chapters.3.3_3 3.3}) are consistent with understanding of how and where water masses form, enhancing the level of confidence in the assessment of the observed changes.

Recent studies showed that the warming of the upper ocean ({Chapters.3.3_2.3_2_2 Section 3.2.2}) very likely affects properties of water masses in the interior, in direct and indirect ways. Transport of {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} and SSS anomalies caused by changes in surface heat and freshwater fluxes are brought into the ocean’s interior by contact with the surface ocean (Sections {Chapters.3.3_2 3.2} and {Chapters.3.3_3 3.3}). Vertical and horizontal displacements of isopycnals due to surface warming could change salinity and temperature ({Chapters.3.3_3 Section 3.3}). Circulation changes ({Chapters.3.3_6 Section 3.6}) could also change salinity by shifting the outcrop area of this isopycnal in regions with higher (or lower) E – P. Properties of several deep and bottom water masses are the product of near surface processes and significant mixing or entrainment of other ambient water masses ({Chapters.3.3_5 Section 3.5}). Changes in the properties of the entrained or admixed {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} could dominate the observed deep and bottom water mass changes, for instance, in the LNADW and the AABW in the Weddell Sea.

From 1950 to 2000, it is likely that subtropical salinity maximum waters have become more saline, while fresh intermediate waters formed at higher latitudes have generally become fresher. In the extratropical North Atlantic, it is very likely that the temperature, salinity, and formation rate of the UNADW is dominated by strong decadal variability related to NAO. It is likely that LNADW has cooled from 1955 to 2005. It is likely that the abyssal layer ventilated by AABW warmed over much of the globe since the 1980s or 1990s respectively, and the volume of cold AABW has been reduced over this time period.
