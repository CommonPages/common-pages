title: 3.8.5 - Conclusions

Based on high agreement between independent estimates using different methods and data sets (e.g., oceanic carbon, oxygen, and transient tracer data), it is very likely that the global ocean inventory of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} carbon (Cant) increased from 1994 to 2010. The oceanic Cant inventory in 2010 is estimated to be 155 PgC with an uncertainty of ±20%. The annual global oceanic {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} rates calculated from independent data sets (from oceanic Cant inventory changes, from atmospheric O2/ N2 measurements or from pCO2 data) and for different time periods agree with each other within their {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and very likely are in the range of 1.0 to 3.2 PgC yr–1. ({Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_1 Section 3.8.1}, Figures {'Figure_3_16 3.16} and {'Figure_3_17 3.17})

Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} results in gradual acidification of the ocean. The {Glossary.*pH pH} of surface seawater has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era, corresponding to a 26% increase in hydrogen ion concentration. The observed pH trends range between –0.0014 and –0.0024 yr–1 in surface waters. In the ocean interior, natural physical and biological processes, as well as uptake of anthropogenic CO2, can cause changes in pH over decadal and longer time scales ({Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_2 Section 3.8.2}, {'Table_3_2 Table 3.2}, {Box_3_2 Box 3.2}, Figures {'Figure_3_18 3.18} and {'Figure_3_19 3.19}, {FAQ_3_3 FAQ 3.3}).

High agreement among analyses provides medium confidence that oxygen concentrations have decreased in the open ocean {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} in many ocean regions since the 1960s. The general decline is consistent with the expectation that warming-induced stratification leads to a decrease in the supply of oxygen to the thermocline from near surface waters, that warmer waters can hold less oxygen, and that changes in wind-driven circulation affect oxygen concentrations. It is likely that the tropical oxygen minimum zones have expanded in recent decades ({Chapters.3.3_8.3_8_3 Section 3.8.3}, {'Figure_3_20 Figure 3.20}).
