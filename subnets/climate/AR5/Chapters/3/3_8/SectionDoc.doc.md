title: 3.8 - Ocean Biogeochemical Changes, Including Anthropogenic Ocean Acidification

The oceans can store large amounts of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}. The {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir} of inorganic carbon in the ocean is roughly 50 times that of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.3.'Sabine_et_al_2004}). Therefore even small changes in the ocean reservoir can have an impact on the atmospheric concentration of CO2. The ocean also provides an important {Glossary.*Sink sink} for carbon dioxide released by {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities}, the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 (Cant). Currently, an amount of CO2 equivalent to approximately 30% of the total human {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of CO2 to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} is accumulating in the ocean (Mikaloff-Fletcher et al., 2006; Le Quéré et al., 2010). In this section, observations of change in the ocean {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of carbon, the inventory of Cant, and {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} are assessed, as well as changes in oxygen and nutrients. {Chapters.6 Chapter 6} provides a synthesis of the overall {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, including the ocean, atmosphere and {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} and considering both past trends and future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}.
