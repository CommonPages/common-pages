title: 3.8.1.1 - Ocean Uptake of Carbon

The air–sea flux of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} is computed from the observed difference in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) across the air–water interface (∆pCO2 = pCO2,swpCO2,air), the solubility of CO2 in seawater, and the gas transfer velocity ({cite.3.'Wanninkhof_et_al_2009}). However, the limited geographic and temporal coverage of the ∆pCO2 measurement as well as {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in wind {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} and transfer velocity parameterizations mean that uncertainties in global and regional fluxes calculated from measurements of ∆pCO2 can be as larges as ±50% ({cite.3.'Wanninkhof_et_al_2013}). Using ∆pCO2 data in combination with the riverine input {cite.3.'Gruber_et_al_2009 Gruber et al. (2009)} estimated a global uptake rate of 1.9 [1.2 to 2.5] PgC yr–1 for the time period 1995–2000 and {cite.3.'Takahashi_et_al_2009 Takahashi et al. (2009)} found 2.0 [1.0 to 3.0] PgC yr–1 normalized to the year 2000. Uncertainties in fluxes calculated from ∆pCO2 are too large to detect trends in global ocean carbon uptake.

Trends in surface ocean pCO2 are calculated from ocean time series stations and repeat hydrographic sections in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ({'Table_3_2 Table 3.2}). At all locations and for all time periods shown, pCO2 in both the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and ocean has increased, while {Glossary.*pH pH} and [CO32–] have decreased. At some sites, oceanic surface pCO2 increased faster than the atmospheric {Glossary.*Trend trend}, implying a decreasing uptake of atmospheric CO2 at those locations. The oceanic pCO2 trend can differ from that in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} owing to changes in the intensity of biological production and changes in physical conditions, for instance between El Niño and {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña} ({cite.3.'Keeling_et_al_2004}; {cite.3.'Midorikawa_et_al_2005}; Yoshikawa-Inoue and Ishii, 2005; {cite.3.'Takahashi_et_al_2006}, 2009; {cite.3.'Schuster_and_Watson_2007}; {cite.3.'Ishii_et_al_2009}; {cite.3.'McKinley_et_al_2011}; {cite.3.'Bates_2012}; {cite.3.'Lenton_et_al_2012}).

Although local variations of ∆pCO2 with time have little effect on the atmospheric CO2 growth rate in the short term, they provide important information on the dynamics of the ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} and the potential for longer-term climate feedbacks. For example, El Niño and La Niña can drive large changes in the efflux of CO2 in the Pacific. Differences in ∆pCO2 can exceed 100 μatm in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific between El Niño and La Niña; an increase in ∆pCO2 observed between 1998 and 2004 was {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to wind and circulation changes associated with the {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation Pacific Decadal Oscillation} ({cite.3.'Feely_et_al_2006}). CO2 uptake in the North Atlantic decreased by 0.24 [0.19– 0.29] PgC yr–1 between 1994 and 2003 ({cite.3.'Schuster_and_Watson_2007}) and has partially recovered since then ({cite.3.'Watson_et_al_2009}). Linear trends for the North Atlantic from 1995 to 2009 reveal an increased uptake ({cite.3.'Schuster_et_al_2013}). {Glossary.*Uptake Uptake} of CO2 in the Subtropical Mode Water (STMW) of the North Atlantic was enhanced during the 1990s, a predominantly positive phase of the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, and much reduced in the 2000s when the NAO phase was neutral or negative ({cite.3.'Bates_2012}). Observations in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean were interpreted as evidence for reduced winter-time CO2 uptake as a result of increased winds, increased upwelling and outgassing of natural CO2 ({cite.3.'Metzl_2009}; {cite.3.'Lenton_et_al_2012}).
