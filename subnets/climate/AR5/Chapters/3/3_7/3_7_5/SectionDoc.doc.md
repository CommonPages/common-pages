title: 3.7.5 - Changes in Extreme Sea Level

Aside from non-climatic events such as tsunamis, extremes in sea level (i.e., coastal flooding, {Glossary.*Storm_surge storm surge}, high water events, etc.) tend to be caused by large storms, especially when they occur at times of high tide. However, any low-pressure system offshore with associated high winds can cause a coastal flooding event depending on the duration and direction of the winds. Evaluation of changes in frequency and intensity of storms have been treated in Sections {Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_3 2.6.3} and {Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_4 2.6.4}, as well as SREX {Chapters.3 Chapter 3} ({Chapters.3.3_5.3_5_2 Section 3.5.2}). The main conclusions from both are that there is low confidence of any {Glossary.*Trend trend} or long term change in tropical or extratropic storm frequency or intensity in any ocean basin, although there is robust evidence for an increase in the most intense tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin since the 1970s. The magnitude and frequency of {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} can still increase without a change in storm intensity, however, if the mean water level is also increasing. {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that the highest water levels have been increasing since the 1950s in most regions of the world, caused mainly by increasing {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level}. Studies published since AR4 continue to support this conclusion, although higher regional extremes are also caused by large interannual and multi-decadal variations in sea level associated with climate fluctuations such as {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation North Atlantic Oscillation} and the {Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation}, among others (e.g., {cite.3.'Abeysirigunawardena_and_Walker_2008}; {cite.3.'Haigh_et_al_2010}; Menéndez and Woodworth, 2010; {cite.3.'Park_et_al_2011}).

Global analyses of the changes in {Glossary.*Extreme_sea_level extreme sea level} are limited, and most reports are based on analysis of regional data (see {cite.3.'Lowe_et_al_2010} for a review). Estimates of changes in extremes rely either on the analysis of local {Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge} data, or on multi-decadal hindcasts of a dynamical model (WASA-Group, 1998). Most analyses have focused on specific regions and find that extreme values have been increasing since the 1950s, using various statistical measures such as annual maximum surge, annual maximum surge-at-high-water, monthly mean high water level, changes in number of high storm surge events, or changes in 99th percentile events (e.g., {cite.3.'Church_et_al_2006}; D’Onofrio et al., 2008; {cite.3.'Marcos_et_al_2009}; {cite.3.'Haigh_et_al_2010}; {cite.3.'Letetrel_et_al_2010}; {cite.3.'Tsimplis_and_Shaw_2010}; {cite.3.'Vilibic_and_Sepic_2010}; {cite.3.'Grinsted_et_al_2012}). A global analysis of tide gauge records has been performed for data from the 1970s onwards when the global data sampling has been robust and finds that the magnitude of extreme sea level events has increased in all regions studied since that time ({cite.3.'Woodworth_and_Blackman_2004}; Menéndez and Woodworth, 2010; {cite.3.'Woodworth_et_al_2011}).

The height of a 50-year flood event has increased anywhere from 2 to more than 10 cm per decade since 1970 ({'Figure_3_15 Figure 3.15}a), although some areas have seen a negative rate because vertical land motion is much larger than the rate of mean sea level rise. However, when the annual median height at each gauge is removed to reduce the effect of local mean sea level rise, interannual and decadal fluctuations, and vertical land motion, the rate of extreme {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} drops in 49% of the gauges to below significance ({'Figure_3_15 Figure 3.15}b), while at 45% it fell to less than 5 mm yr–1. Only 6% of tide gauge records evaluated had a change in the amplitude of more than 5 mm yr–1 after removing mean sea level variations, mainly in the southeast United States, the western Pacific, Southeast Asia and a few locations in Northern Europe. The higher rates in the southeastern United States have been linked to larger storm surge events unconnected to global sea level rise ({cite.3.'Grinsted_et_al_2012}).
