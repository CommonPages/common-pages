title: 3.2.2 - Upper Ocean Temperature

Depth-averaged 0 to 700 m ocean temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive over most of the globe ({cite.3.'Levitus_et_al_2009}; {'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}a). The warming is more prominent in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), especially the North Atlantic. This result holds in different analyses, using different time periods, bias corrections and data sources (e.g., with or without XBT or MBT data) (e.g., {cite.3.'Palmer_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.3.'Gleckler_et_al_2012}; Figures {'Figure_3_1 3.1} and {'Figure_3_9 3.9}). However, the greater volume of the SH oceans increases the contribution of their warming to global heat content. Zonally averaged upper ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths ({cite.3.'Levitus_et_al_2009}, {'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}b). A maximum in warming south of 30°S appears in {'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}b, but is not as strong as in other analyses (e.g., {cite.3.'Gille_2008}), likely because the data are relatively sparse in this location so anomalies are attenuated by the objectively analyzed fields used for {'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1} and because warming in the upper 1000 m of the Southern Ocean was stronger between the 1930s and the 1970s than between the 1970s and 1990s ({cite.3.'Gille_2008}). Another warming maximum is present at 25°N to 65°N. Both warming signals extend to 700 m ({cite.3.'Levitus_et_al_2009}, {'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}b), and are consistent with poleward displacement of the mean temperature field. Other zonally averaged temperature changes are also consistent with poleward displacement of the mean temperatures. For example, cooling at depth between 30°S and the equator ({'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}b) is consistent with a southward shift of cooler water near the equator. Poleward displacements of some subtropical and subpolar zonal currents and associated wind changes are discussed in {Chapters.3.3_6 Section 3.6}.

Globally averaged ocean temperature anomalies as a function of depth and time ({'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}c) relative to a 1971–2010 mean reveal warming at all depths in the upper 700 m over the relatively well-sampled 40-year period considered. Strongest warming is found closest to the sea surface, and the near-surface trends are consistent with independently measured {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} ({Chapters.2 Chapter 2}). The global average warming over this period is 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade in the upper 75 m, decreasing to 0.015°C per decade by 700 m ({'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}c). Comparison of Argo data to Challenger expedition data from the 1870s suggests that warming started earlier than 1971, and was also larger in the Atlantic than in the Pacific over that longer time interval ({cite.3.'Roemmich_et_al_2012}). An observational analysis of temperature in the upper 400 m of the global ocean starting in the year 1900 ({cite.3.'Gouretski_et_al_2012}) finds warming between about 1900 and 1945, as well as after 1970, with some evidence of slight cooling between 1945 and 1970.

The globally averaged temperature difference between the ocean surface and 200 m ({'Figure_3_1 Figure 3.1}d) increased by about 0.25oC from 1971 to 2010 ({cite.3.'Levitus_et_al_2009}). This change, which corresponds to a 4% increase in density stratification, is widespread in all the oceans north of about 40°S.

A potentially important impact of ocean warming is the effect on {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, floating glacial ice and {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} dynamics (see {Chapters.4 Chapter 4} for a discussion of these topics). Although some of the global integrals of UOHC neglect changes poleward of ±60° ({cite.3.'Ishii_and_Kimoto_2009}) or ±65° ({cite.3.'Domingues_et_al_2008}) latitude, at least some parts of the Arctic have warmed: In the Arctic Ocean, subsurface pulses of relatively warm water of Atlantic origin can be traced around the Eurasian Basin, and analyses of data from 1950–2010 show a decadal warming of this {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} since the late 1970s ({cite.3.'Polyakov_et_al_2012}), as well as a shoaling, by 75 to 90 m ({cite.3.'Polyakov_et_al_2010}). Arctic surface waters have also warmed, at least in the Canada Basin, from 1993 to 2007 ({cite.3.'Jackson_et_al_2010}).
