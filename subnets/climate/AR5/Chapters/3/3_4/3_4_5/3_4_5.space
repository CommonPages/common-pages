section 3_4_5

  |Surface wind waves are generated by wind {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} and are partitioned into two components, namely windâ€“sea and swell. {Glossary.*Significant_wave_height Significant wave height} (SWH) represents the measure of the wind wave field and is approximately equal to the highest one-third of wave heights. Studies since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} have provided further evidence for significant positive SWH trends.
