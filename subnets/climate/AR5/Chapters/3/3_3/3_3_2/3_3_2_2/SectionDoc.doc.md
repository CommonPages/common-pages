title: 3.3.2.2 - Upper Ocean Subsurface Salinity

Compatible with observed changes in surface salinity, robust multi-decadal trends in subsurface salinity have been detected ({cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2005}; {cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Steele_and_Ermold_2007}; Böning et al., 2008; {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.3.'Helm_et_al_2010}; {cite.3.'Wang_et_al_2010}). Global, zonally averaged multi-decadal salinity trends (1950–2008) in the upper 500 m ({'Figure_3_4 Figures 3.4}, 3.5, 3.9 and {Chapters.3.3_5 Section 3.5}) show salinity increases at the salinity maxima of the subtropical gyres, freshening of the low-salinity intermediate waters sinking in the Southern Ocean (Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water) and North Pacific (North Pacific Intermediate Water). On average, the Pacific freshened, and the Atlantic became more saline. These trends, shown in Figures {'Figure_3_5 3.5} and {'Figure_3_9 3.9}, are significant at a 95% confidence interval.

Freshwater content in the upper 500 m very likely changed, based on the World Ocean Database 2009 ({cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2009}), analyzed by {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010 Durack and Wijffels (2010)} and independently as an update to {cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2005 Boyer et al. (2005)} for 1955–2010 ({'Figure_3_5 Figure 3.5}a, b, e, f). Both show freshening in the North Pacific, salinification in the North Atlantic south of 50°N and salinification in the northern Indian Ocean (trends significant at 90% confidence). A significant freshening is observed in the circumpolar Southern Ocean south of 50S.

Density layers that are ventilated (connected to the sea surface) in precipitation-dominated regions have freshened, while those ventilated in evaporation-dominated regions have increased in salinity, compatible with an enhancement of the mean surface freshwater flux pattern ({cite.3.'Helm_et_al_2010}). In addition, where warming has caused surface outcrops of density layers to move (poleward) into higher salinity surface waters, the subducted salinity in the density layers has increased; where outcrops have moved into fresher surface waters, the subducted salinity decreased ({cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}). Vertical and lateral shifts of density surfaces, due to both changes in {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} renewal rates and wind-driven circulation, have also contributed to the observed subsurface salinity changes ({cite.3.'Levitus_1989}; {cite.3.'Bindoff_and_McDougall_1994}).

A change in total, globally integrated freshwater content and salinity requires an addition or removal of freshwater; the only significant {Glossary.*Source source} is land ice (ice sheets and glaciers). The estimate of change in globally averaged salinity and freshwater content remains smaller than its {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty}, as was true in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessment. For instance, the globally averaged sea surface salinity change from 1950 to 2008 is small (+0.003 [–0.056 to 0.062]) compared to its error estimate ({cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}). Thus a global freshening due to land ice loss has not yet been discerned in global surface salinity change even if it were assumed that all added freshwater were in the ocean’s {Glossary.*Surface_layer surface layer}.
