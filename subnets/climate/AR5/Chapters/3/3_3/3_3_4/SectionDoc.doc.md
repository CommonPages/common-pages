title: 3.3.4 - Evidence for Change of the Hydrological Cycle from Salinity Changes

The similarity between the geographic distribution of significant salinity and freshwater content trends (Figures {'Figure_3_4 3.4}, {'Figure_3_5 3.5} and {'Figure_3_21 3.21}) and both the mean salinity pattern and the distribution of mean evaporation – precipitation (E – P; {'Figure_3_4 Figure 3.4}) indicates, with medium confidence, that the large-scale pattern of net evaporation minus precipitation over the oceans has been enhanced. Whereas the surface salinity pattern could be enhanced by increased stratification due to surface warming, the large-scale changes in column-integrated freshwater content are very unlikely to result from changes in stratification in the thin {Glossary.*Surface_layer surface layer}. Furthermore, the large spatial scale of the observed changes in freshwater content cannot be explained by changes in ocean circulation such as shifts of {Glossary.*Gyre gyre} boundaries. The observed changes in surface and subsurface salinity require additional horizontal atmospheric water transport from regions of net evaporation to regions of net precipitation. A similar conclusion was reached in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.3.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}). The water vapour in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} has likely increased since the 1970s, due to warming (2.4.4, 2.5.5, 2.5.6; {FAQ_3_2 FAQ 3.2}). The inferred enhanced pattern of net E – P can be related to water vapor increase, although the linkage is complex ({cite.3.'Emori_and_Brown_2005}; {cite.3.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). From 1950 to 2000, the large-scale pattern of surface salinity has amplified at a rate that is larger than model simulations for the historical 20th century and 21st century {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. The observed rate of surface salinity amplification is comparable to the rate expected from a {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} response following the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausius–Clapeyron} relationship ({cite.3.'Durack_et_al_2012}).

Studies published since AR4, based on expanded data sets and new analysis approaches, have substantially decreased the level of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the salinity and freshwater content trends (e.g., {cite.3.'Stott_et_al_2008}; {cite.3.'Hosoda_et_al_2009}; {cite.3.'Roemmich_and_Gilson_2009}; {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.3.'Helm_et_al_2010}), and thus increased confidence in the inferred changes of evaporation and precipitation over the ocean.
