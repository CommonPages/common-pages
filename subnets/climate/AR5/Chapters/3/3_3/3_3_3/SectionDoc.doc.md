title: 3.3.3 - Regional Changes in Upper Ocean Salinity

Regional changes in ocean salinity are broadly consistent with the conclusion that regions of net precipitation (precipitation greater than evaporation) have very likely become fresher, while regions of net evaporation have become more saline. This pattern is seen in salinity {Glossary.*Trend trend} maps ({'Figure_3_4 Figure 3.4}); zonally averaged salinity trends and freshwater inventories for each ocean ({'Figure_3_5 Figure 3.5}); and the globally averaged contrast between regions of high and low salinity ({'Figure_3_21 Figure 3.21}d). In the high-latitude regions, higher {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, increased melting of ice and changes in freshwater transport by ocean currents have likely also contributed to observed salinity changes ({cite.3.'Bersch_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Polyakov_et_al_2008}; {cite.3.'Jacobs_and_Giulivi_2010}).
