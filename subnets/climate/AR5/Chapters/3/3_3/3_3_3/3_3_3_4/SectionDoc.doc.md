Widespread freshening ({Glossary.*Trend trend} of –0.01 per decade, significant at 95% confidence, from the 1980s to 2000s) of the upper 1000 m of the Southern Ocean was inferred by taking differences between modern data (mostly Argo) and a long-term climatology along mean streamlines (Böning et al., 2008). Decadal variability, although notable, does not overwhelm this trend (Böning et al., 2008). Both a southward shift of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and water-mass changes contribute to the observed trends during the period 1992–2009 ({cite.3.'Meijers_et_al_2011}). The zonally averaged freshwater content for each ocean and the world ({'Figure_3_5 Figure 3.5}) shows this significant Southern Ocean freshening, which exceeds other regional trends and is present in each basin (Indian, Atlantic and Pacific, {'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}).
