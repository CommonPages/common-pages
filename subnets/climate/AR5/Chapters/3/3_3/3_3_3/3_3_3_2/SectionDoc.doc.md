The net evaporative North Atlantic has become saltier as a whole over the past 50 years ({'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}; {cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2007}). The largest increase in the upper 700 m occurred in the Gulf Stream {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} (0.006 per decade between 1955–1959 and 2002–2006) ({cite.3.'Wang_et_al_2010}). Salinity increase is also evident following the circulation pathway of Mediterranean Outflow Water ({'Figure_3_9 Figure 3.9}; {cite.3.'Fusco_et_al_2008}). This increase can be traced back to the western basin of the Mediterranean, where salinity of the deep water increased during the period from 1943 to the mid-2000s ({cite.3.'Smith_et_al_2008}; Vargas-Yáñez et al., 2010).

During the time period between 1955–1959 and 2002–2006 (using salinities averaged over the indicated 5-year ranges), the upper 700 m of the subpolar North Atlantic freshened by up to 0.002 per decade ({cite.3.'Wang_et_al_2010}), while an increase in surface salinity was found between the average taken over 1960–1989 and the 5-year average over 2003–2007 ({cite.3.'Hosoda_et_al_2009}). Decadal and multi-decadal variability in the subpolar {Glossary.*Gyre gyre} and Nordic Seas is vigorous and has been related to various {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate modes} such as the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}, {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}), and even El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}; {cite.3.'Polyakov_et_al_2005}; {cite.3.'Yashayaev_and_Loder_2009}), obscuring long-term trends. The 1970s to 1990s freshening of the northern North Atlantic and Nordic Seas ({cite.3.'Dickson_et_al_2002}; {cite.3.'Curry_et_al_2003}; {cite.3.'Curry_and_Mauritzen_2005}) reversed to salinification (0 to 2000 m depth) starting in the late 1990s ({cite.3.'Boyer_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Holliday_et_al_2008}), and the propagation of this signal could be followed along the eastern boundary from south of 60°N in the Northeast Atlantic to Fram Strait at 79°N ({cite.3.'Holliday_et_al_2008}). {Glossary.*Advection Advection} has also played a role in moving higher salinity subtropical waters to the subpolar gyre ({cite.3.'Hatun_et_al_2005}; {cite.3.'Bersch_et_al_2007}; {cite.3.'Lozier_and_Stewart_2008}; {cite.3.'Valdimarsson_et_al_2012}). The variability of the cross equatorial transport contribution to this budget is highly uncertain. Reversals of North Atlantic surface salinity of similar amplitude and duration to those observed in the last 50 years are apparent in the early 20th century ({cite.3.'Reverdin_et_al_2002}; {cite.3.'Reverdin_2010}). The evaporation-dominated subtropical South Atlantic has become saltier by 0.1 to 0.3 during the period from 1950 to 2008 ({cite.3.'Hosoda_et_al_2009}; {cite.3.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {'Figure_3_4 Figure 3.4}).
