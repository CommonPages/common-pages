title: Box 6.1 - Multiple Residence Times for an Excess of Carbon Dioxide Emitted in the Atmosphere

On an average, {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} molecules are exchanged between the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and the Earth surface every few years. This fast CO2 cycling through the atmosphere is coupled to a slower cycling of carbon through land vegetation, litter and soils and the upper ocean (decades to centuries); deeper soils and the deep sea (centuries to millennia); and geological reservoirs, such as deep-sea carbonate sediments and the upper mantle (up to millions of years) as explained in {Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_1.6_1_1_1 Section 6.1.1.1}. Atmospheric CO2 represents only a tiny fraction of the carbon in the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System}, the rest of which is tied up in these other reservoirs. Emission of carbon from fossil fuel reserves, and additionally from {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} (see {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}) is now rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 content. The removal of all the human-emitted CO2 from the atmosphere by natural processes will take a few hundred thousand years (high confidence) as shown by the timescales of the removal process shown in the table below ({cite.6.'Archer_and_Brovkin_2008}). For instance, an extremely long atmospheric CO2 recovery time scale from a large emission pulse of CO2 has been inferred from geological evidence when during the Paleoceneâ€“Eocene thermal maximum event about 55 million years ago a large amount of CO2 was released to the atmosphere ({cite.6.'McInerney_and_Wing_2011}). Based on the amount of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere after a pulse of {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (data from Joos et al. 2013) and on the magnitude of the historical and future emissions for each RCP scenario, we assessed that about 15 to 40% of CO2 emitted until 2100 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1000 years.

These processes are active on all time scales, but the relative importance of their role in the CO2 removal is changing with time and depends on the level of emissions. Accordingly, the times of atmospheric CO2 adjustment to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} carbon emissions can be divided into three phases associated with increasingly longer time scales.

Phase 1. Within several decades of CO2 emissions, about a third to half of an initial pulse of anthropogenic CO2 goes into the land and ocean, while the rest stays in the atmosphere ({Box_6_1 Box 6.1}, {'Box_6_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}a). Within a few centuries, most of the anthropogenic CO2 will be in the form of additional dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean, thereby decreasing ocean {Glossary.*pH pH} ({Box_6_1 Box 6.1}, {'Box_6_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}b). Within a thousand years, the remaining atmospheric fraction of the CO2 emissions (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_4 Section 6.3.2.4}) is between 15 and 40%, depending on the amount of carbon released ({cite.6.'Archer_et_al_2009b}). The carbonate buffer capacity of the ocean decreases with higher CO2, so the larger the cumulative emissions, the higher the remaining atmospheric fraction ({cite.6.'Eby_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Joos_et_al_2013}).

Phase 2. In the second stage, within a few thousands of years, the pH of the ocean that has decreased in Phase 1 will be restored by reaction of ocean dissolved CO2 and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) of sea floor sediments, partly replenishing the buffer capacity of the ocean and further drawing down atmospheric CO2 as a new balance is re-established between CaCO3 sedimentation in the ocean and terrestrial {Glossary.*Weathering weathering} ({Box_6_1 Box 6.1}, {'Box_6_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}c right). This second phase will pull the remaining atmospheric CO2 fraction down to 10 to 25% of the original CO2 pulse after about 10 kyr ({cite.6.'Lenton_and_Britton_2006}; {cite.6.'Montenegro_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Ridgwell_and_Hargreaves_2007}; {cite.6.'Tyrrell_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Archer_and_Brovkin_2008}).

Phase 3. In the third stage, within several hundred thousand years, the rest of the CO2 emitted during the initial pulse will be removed from the atmosphere by silicate weathering, a very slow process of CO2 reaction with calcium silicate (CaSiO3) and other minerals of igneous rocks (e.g., {cite.6.'Sundquist_1990}; {cite.6.'Walker_and_Kasting_1992}).

Involvement of extremely long time scale processes into the removal of a pulse of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere complicates comparison with the cycling of the other {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}. This is why the concept of a single, characteristic atmospheric {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} is not applicable to CO2 ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}).
