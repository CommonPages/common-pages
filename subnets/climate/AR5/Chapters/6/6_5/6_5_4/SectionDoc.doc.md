title: 6.5.4 - Impacts of Solar Radiation Management on the Carbon Cycle

{Glossary.*Solar_radiation Solar radiation} management ({Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM}) methods aim to reduce {Glossary.*Incoming_solar_radiation incoming solar radiation} at the surface (discussed in {Chapters.7.7_7 Section 7.7} and in AR5, WG2, Chapter 19). Balancing reduced outgoing radiation by reduced incoming radiation may be able to cool {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature} but may lead to a less intense global {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} ({cite.6.'Bala_et_al_2008}) with regionally different climate impacts ({cite.6.'Govindasamy_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007}; {cite.6.'Robock_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Irvine_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Ricke_et_al_2010}). Therefore, SRM will not prevent the effects of climate change on the carbon and other biogeochemical cycles.

SRM could reduce climate warming but will not interfere with the direct biogeochemical effects of elevated {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} on the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. For example, {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} caused by elevated CO2 ({Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_4 Section 6.4.4}) and the CO2 fertilisation of productivity ({Box_6_3 Box 6.3}) will not be altered by SRM ({cite.6.'Govindasamy_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Naik_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007}). Similarly, SRM will not interfere with the stomatal response of plants to elevated CO2 (the CO2-physiological effect) that leads to a decline in {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration}, causing land temperatures to warm and {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} to increase ({cite.6.'Gedney_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Betts_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007}; {cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Cao_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Fyfe_et_al_2013}).

However, due to carbonâ€“climate feedbacks ({Chapters.6.6_4 Section 6.4}), the implementation of SRM could affect the carbon cycle. For instance, carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} by land and ocean could increase in response to SRM by reducing the negative effects of climate change on carbon sinks ({cite.6.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007}). For instance, for the SRES A2 scenario with SRM, a lower CO2 concentration of 110 ppm by year 2100 relative to a baseline case without SRM has been simulated by {cite.6.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007 Matthews and Caldeira (2007)}. Land carbon sinks may be enhanced by increasing the amount of diffuse relative to direct radiation ({cite.6.'Mercado_et_al_2009}) if SRM causes the fraction of diffuse light to increase (e.g., injection of aerosols into the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}). However, reduction of total incoming solar radiation could decrease terrestrial CO2 sinks as well.
