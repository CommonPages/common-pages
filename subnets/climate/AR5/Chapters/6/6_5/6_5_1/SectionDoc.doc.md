title: 6.5.1 - Introduction to Carbon Dioxide Removal Methods

To slow or perhaps reverse {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} increases in atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({Chapters.6.6_4 Section 6.4}), several methods have been proposed to increase the removal of atmospheric CO2 and enhance the storage of carbon in land, ocean and geological reservoirs. These methods are categorized as ‘Carbon Dioxide Removal ({Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR})’ methods (see Glossary). Another class of methods involves the intentional manipulation of planetary solar absorption to counter climate change, and is called the ‘Solar Radiation Management ({Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM})’ (discussed in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}, {Chapters.7.7_7 Section 7.7}; see Glossary). In this section, CDR methods are discussed from the aspect of the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} processes ({Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_2 Section 6.5.2}) and their impacts and side effects on carbon cycle and climate ({Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_3 Section 6.5.3}). A brief discussion on the indirect carbon cycle effects of SRM methods is given in {Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_4 Section 6.5.4}. Most of the currently proposed CDR methods are summarized in {'Table_6_14 Table 6.14} and some are illustrated schematically in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7} ({Chapters.7.7_7 Section 7.7}; {FAQ_7_3 FAQ 7.3} Figure 1). Since some CDR methods might operate on large spatial scales they are also called ‘{Glossary.*Geoengineering Geoengineering}’ proposals ({cite.6.'Keith_2001}). Removal of {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} has also been proposed to reduce climate change ({cite.6.'Stolaroff_et_al_2012}). While the science of geoengineering methods is assessed in this section (CDR) and {Chapters.7 Chapter 7} (SRM), the benefits and risks of SRM are planned to be assessed in Chapter 19 of AR5 WGII report. Further, Chapter 6 of AR5 WGIII report plans to assess the cost and socioeconomic implications of some CDR and SRM methods for climate stabilization pathways.

Large-scale industrial methods such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), biofuel energy production (without CCS) and reducing {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation} and degradation (REDD) cannot be called CDR methods since they reduce fossil fuel use or {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} CO2 emissions to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} but they do not involve a net removal of CO2 that is already in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}. However, {Glossary.*Direct_Air_Capture direct air capture} of CO2 using industrial methods ({'Table_6_14 Table 6.14}; and {FAQ_7_3 FAQ 7.3} Figure 1) will remove CO2 from the atmosphere and is thus considered as a CDR method. The distinction between CDR and {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} (see Glossary) is not clear and there could be some overlap between the two.

Insofar as the CDR-removed CO2 is sequestered in a permanent {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir}, CDR methods could potentially reduce direct consequences of high CO2 levels, including {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} (see {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_4 Section 6.4.4}) ({cite.6.'Matthews_et_al_2009}). However, the effects of CDR methods that propose to manipulate carbon cycle processes are slow (see {Box_6_1 Box 6.1}) and hence the consequent climate effects would be slow. The climate system has a less than 5-years relaxation (e-folding) time scale for an assumed instantaneous reduction in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} to preindustrial levels ({cite.6.'Held_et_al_2010}). While the climate effect of SRM could be rapid ({cite.6.'Shepherd_et_al_2009}) given this time scale, at present, there is no known CDR method, including industrial direct air capture that can feasibly reduce atmospheric CO2 to pre-industrial levels within a similar time scale. Therefore, CDR methods do not present an option for rapidly preventing climate change when compared to SRM. It is likely that CDR would have to be deployed at large-scale for at least one century to be able to significantly reduce atmospheric CO2.

Important carbon cycle science considerations for evaluating CDR methods include the associated carbon storage capacity, the permanence of carbon storage and potential adverse side effects ({cite.6.'Shepherd_et_al_2009}). Geological reservoirs could store several thousand PgC and the ocean may be able to store a few thousand PgC of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} carbon in the long-term ({cite.6.'Metz_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'House_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Orr_2009}) (see {Box_6_1 Box 6.1} and {cite.6.'Archer_et_al_2009b}). The terrestrial {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} may have a typical potential to store carbon equivalent to the cumulative historical land use loss of 180 ± 80 PgC ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}; {Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_2.6_5_2_1 Section 6.5.2.1}).

In this assessment, we use “permanence” to refer to time scales larger than tens of thousands of years. CDR methods associated with either permanent or non-permanent carbon {Glossary.*Sequestration sequestration} (see {'Table_6_14 Table 6.14}) have very different climate implications ({cite.6.'Kirschbaum_2003}). Permanent sequestration methods have the potential to reduce the radiative forcing of CO2 over time. By contrast, non-permanent sequestration methods will release back the temporarily sequestered carbon as CO2 to the atmosphere, after some delayed time interval ({cite.6.'Herzog_et_al_2003}). As a consequence, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and climate warming will only be delayed and not avoided by the implementation of non-permanent CDR methods ({'Figure_6_39 Figure 6.39}). Nevertheless, CDR methods that could create a temporary CO2 removal ({'Table_6_14 Table 6.14}) may still have value ({cite.6.'Dornburg_and_Marland_2008}) by reducing the cumulative impact of higher temperature.

Another important carbon cycle consequence of CDR methods is the ‘{Glossary.*Rebound_effect rebound effect}’ (see Glossary). In the Industrial Era (since 1750) about half of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from {Glossary.*Fossil_fuel_emissions fossil fuel emissions} has been taken up by land and ocean carbon reservoirs (see {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3} and {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). As for current CO2 emissions and the consequent CO2 rise, which are currently opposed by {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of CO2 by natural reservoirs, any removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by CDR will be opposed by release of CO2 from natural reservoirs ({'Figure_6_40 Figure 6.40}). It is thus virtually certain that the removal of CO2 by CDR will be partially offset by outgassing of CO2 from the ocean and land ecosystems. Therefore, returning to pre-industrial CO2 levels would require permanently sequestering an amount of carbon equal to total anthropogenic CO2 emissions that have been released before the time of CDR, roughly twice as much the excess of atmospheric CO2 above pre-industrial level ({cite.6.'Lenton_and_Vaughan_2009}; {cite.6.'Cao_and_Caldeira_2010b}; {cite.6.'Matthews_2010}).
