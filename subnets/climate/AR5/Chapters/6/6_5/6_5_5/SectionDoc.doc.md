{Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR} methods are intentional large scale methods to remove atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} either by managing the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} or by direct industrial processes ({'Table_6_14 Table 6.14}). In contrast to {Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM} methods, CDR methods that manage the carbon cycle are unlikely to present an option for rapidly preventing climate change. The maximum (idealised) potential for atmospheric CO2 removal by individual CDR methods is compiled in {'Table_6_15 Table 6.15}. In this compilation, note that unrealistic assumptions about the scale of deployment, such as fertilising the entire global ocean, are used, and hence large potentials are simulated. The ‘{Glossary.*Rebound_effect rebound effect}’ in the natural carbon cycle is likely to diminish the effectiveness of all the CDR methods ({'Figure_6_40 Figure 6.40}). The level of confidence on the effects of both CDR and SRM methods on carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is very low.
