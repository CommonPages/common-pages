title: 6.5.3.3 - Impact of Enhanced Weathering

In the case of {Glossary.*Weathering weathering}-based {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR}, the {Glossary.*pH pH} and carbonate mineral saturation of soils, rivers and ocean surface waters will increase where CDR is implemented. Köhler et al. (2010) simulated that the pH of the Amazon river would rise by 2.5 units if the dissolution of olivine in the entire Amazon basin was used to remove 0.5 PgC yr–1 from the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. In the marine environment, elevated pH and increased {Glossary.*Alkalinity alkalinity} could potentially counteract the effects of {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification}, which is beneficial. Changes in alkalinity could also modify existing ecosystems. There is {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in our understanding of the net effect on ocean {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} but there will be a partial offset of the abiotic effect by calcifying species. As for other CDR methods, the confidence level on the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} impacts of enhanced weathering is low.
