title: 6.5.3.2 - Impacts of Enhanced Carbon Sequestration in the Ocean

In the case of ocean-based {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR} using fertilisation, adding macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate in the fertilised {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} could lead to a decrease in production ‘downstream’ of the fertilised region ({cite.6.'Gnanadesikan_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Gnanadesikan_and_Marinov_2008}; {cite.6.'Watson_et_al_2008}). {cite.6.'Gnanadesikan_et_al_2003 Gnanadesikan et al. (2003)} simulated a decline in export production of 30 tC for every ton removed from the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. A sustained global-ocean iron fertilisation for SRES A2 {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emission} scenario was also found to acidify the deep ocean ({Glossary.*pH pH} decrease of about 0.1 to 0.2) while mitigating surface pH change by only 0.06 ({cite.6.'Cao_and_Caldeira_2010a}). Other environmental risks associated with ocean fertilisation include expanded regions with low oxygen concentration ({cite.6.'Oschlies_et_al_2010a}), increased {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} emission ({cite.6.'Jin_and_Gruber_2003}), increased production of dimethylsulphide (DMS), isoprene, CO, N2O, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and other non-CO2 {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} ({cite.6.'Oschlies_et_al_2010a}) and possible disruptions to marine ecosystems ({cite.6.'Denman_2008}).

In the case of enhanced ocean upwelling CDR methods there could be disturbance to the regional carbon balances, since the extra-upwelling will be balanced by extra-downwelling at another location. Along with growth-supporting nutrients, enhanced concentrations of DIC will also be brought to surface waters and partially offset the removal of CO2 by increased {Glossary.*Biological_pump biological pump}. Further, in case artificially enhanced upwelling would be stopped, atmospheric CO2 concentrations could rise rapidly because carbon removed from the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and stored in soils in the cooler climate caused by artificial upwelling could be rapidly released back ({cite.6.'Oschlies_et_al_2010b}). The level of confidence on the impacts of the enhanced upwelling is low.
