title: 6.5.3 - Impacts of Carbon Dioxide Removal Methods on Carbon Cycle and Climate

One impact common to all {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR} methods is related to the thermal inertia of the climate system. Climate warming will indeed continue for at least decades after CDR is applied. Therefore, temperature (and climate change) will lag a CDR-induced decrease in atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({cite.6.'Boucher_et_al_2012}). Modelling the impacts of CDR on climate change is still in its infancy. Some of the first studies ({cite.6.'Wu_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Cao_et_al_2011}) showed that the global {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} could intensify in response to a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
