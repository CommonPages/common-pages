title: 6.5.3.1 - Impacts of Enhanced Land Carbon Sequestration

In the case of land-based {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR}, {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} in forests is a non-permanent {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} carbon pool and hence there is a risk that this carbon may return to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, for example, by disturbances such as fire, or by future {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}. When considering {Glossary.*Afforestation afforestation}/{Glossary.*Reforestation reforestation}, it is also important to account for biophysical effects on climate that come together with carbon {Glossary.*Sequestration sequestration} because afforestation/ reforestation changes the {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} (see Glossary), {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration} and the roughness of the surface ({cite.6.'Bonan_2008}; {cite.6.'Bernier_et_al_2011}). Modelling studies show that afforestation in seasonally snow covered boreal and temperate regions will decrease the land surface albedo and have a net (biophysical plus biogeochemical) warming effect, whereas afforestation in low latitudes (Tropics) is likely to enhance {Glossary.*Latent_heat_flux latent heat flux} from evapotranspiration and have a net cooling effect ({cite.6.'Bonan_et_al_1992}; {cite.6.'Betts_2000}; {cite.6.'Bala_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Montenegro_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Bathiany_et_al_2010}). Consequently, the location of land ecosystem based CDR methods needs to be considered carefully when evaluating their effects on climate ({cite.6.'Bala_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Arora_and_Montenegro_2011}; {cite.6.'Lee_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Pongratz_et_al_2011b}). In addition CDR in land ecosystems is likely to increase {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({cite.6.'Li_et_al_2005}). Enhanced biomass production may also require more nutrients (fertilisers) which are associated with fossil fuel {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} emission from industrial fertiliser production and Nr impacts. Biochar-based CDR could reduce N2O emissions but may increase CO2 and {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} emissions from agricultural soils ({cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2012b}). Addition of biochar could also promote a rapid loss of {Glossary.*Forest forest} humus and soil carbon in some ecosystems during the first decades ({cite.6.'Wardle_et_al_2008}).
