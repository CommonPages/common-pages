title: 6.5.2.4 - Carbon Dioxide Removal by Direct Industrial Capture of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

{Glossary.*Direct_Air_Capture Direct Air Capture} refers to the chemical process by which a pure {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} stream is produced by capturing CO2 from ambient air. The captured CO2 could be sequestered in geological reservoirs or the deep ocean. At least three methods have been proposed to capture CO2 from the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}: (1) adsorption on solids ({cite.6.'Gray_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Lackner_2009}, 2010; {cite.6.'Lackner_et_al_2012}); (2) absorption into highly alkaline solutions ({cite.6.'Stolaroff_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Mahmoudkhani_and_Keith_2009}) and (3) absorption into moderate alkaline solution with a catalyst ({cite.6.'Bao_and_Trachtenberg_2006}). The main limitation to direct air capture is the thermodynamic barrier due to the low concentration of CO2 in ambient air.
