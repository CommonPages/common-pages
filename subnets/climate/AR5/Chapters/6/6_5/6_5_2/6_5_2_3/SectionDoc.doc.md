title: 6.5.2.3 - Accelerated Weathering

The removal of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} by the {Glossary.*Weathering weathering} of silicate and carbonate minerals ({cite.6.'Berner_et_al_1983}; {cite.6.'Archer_et_al_2009b}) occurs on time scales from thousands to tens of thousands of years (see {Box_6_1 Box 6.1}) and at a rate of ~ 0.3 PgC yr–1 ({'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}; {cite.6.'Gaillardet_et_al_1999}; {cite.6.'Hartmann_et_al_2009}). This rate is currently much too small to offset the rate at which fossil fuel CO2 is being emitted ({Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}).

The principle of accelerated weathering {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR} on land is to dissolve artificially silicate minerals so drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and geochemical equilibrium restoration could proceed on a much faster (century) time scale. For instance, large amounts of silicate minerals such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4) could be mined, crushed, transported to and distributed on agricultural lands, to remove atmospheric CO2 and form carbonate minerals in soils and/or bicarbonate ions that would be transported to the ocean by rivers ({cite.6.'Schuiling_and_Krijgsman_2006})l. Alternatively, CO2 removal by weathering reactions might be enhanced by exposing minerals such as basalt or olivine to elevated CO2, with potential CO2 removal rates exceeding 0.25 PgC yr–1 ({cite.6.'Kelemen_and_Matter_2008}). In the idealised case where olivine could be spread as a fine powder over all the humid tropics, potential removal rates of up to 1 PgC yr–1 have been estimated, despite limitations by the saturation concentration of silicic acid (Köhler et al., 2010). For the United Kingdom, the potential from silicate resources was estimated to be more than 100 PgC ({cite.6.'Renforth_2012}).

Fossil fuel CO2 released to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} leads to the addition of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 in the ocean ({Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5 Section 6.3.2.5}). This anthropogenic CO2 will eventually dissolve ocean floor carbonate sediments to reach geochemical equilibrium on a 10 kyr time scale ({cite.6.'Archer_et_al_1997}). The principle of ocean based weathering CDR methods is to accelerate this process. For instance, carbonate rocks could be crushed, reacted with CO2 (e.g., captured at power plants) to produce bicarbonate ions that would be released to the ocean ({cite.6.'Rau_and_Caldeira_1999}; {cite.6.'Caldeira_and_Rau_2000}; {cite.6.'Rau_2008}). Alternatively, carbonate minerals could be directly released into the ocean ({cite.6.'Kheshgi_1995}; {cite.6.'Harvey_2008}). Strong bases, derived from silicate rocks, could also be released to ocean ({cite.6.'House_et_al_2007}) to increase {Glossary.*Alkalinity alkalinity} and drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Carbonate minerals such as limestone could be heated to produce lime (Ca(OH)2); this lime could be added to the ocean to increase alkalinity as well ({cite.6.'Kheshgi_1995}). While the level of confidence is very high for the scientific understanding of weathering chemical reactions, it is low for its effects and risks at planetary scale ({Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_3.6_5_3_3 Section 6.5.3.3}).
