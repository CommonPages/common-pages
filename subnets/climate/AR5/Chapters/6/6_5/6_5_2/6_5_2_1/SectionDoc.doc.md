title: 6.5.2.1 - Enhanced Carbon Sequestration by Land Ecosystems

The key driver of these {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR} methods is net primary productivity on land that currently produces {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} at a rate of approximately 50 to 60 PgC yr–1 ({cite.6.'Nemani_et_al_2003}). The principle of these CDR methods is to increase net primary productivity and/or store a larger fraction of the biomass produced into {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} carbon pools with long turnover times, for example, under the form of wood or refractory organic matter in soils ({'Table_6_14 Table 6.14}). One variant is to harvest biomass for energy production and sequester the emitted {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} (BECCS). BECCS technology has not been tested at industrial scale, but is commonly included in Integrated Assessment Models and future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} that aim to achieve low CO2 concentrations.

Estimates of the global potential for enhanced primary productivity over land are uncertain because the potential of any specific method will be severely constrained by competing land needs (e.g., agriculture, biofuels, urbanization and conservation) and sociocultural considerations. An order of magnitude of the upper potential of {Glossary.*Afforestation afforestation}/ {Glossary.*Reforestation reforestation} would be the restoration of all the carbon released by historical land use (180 ± 80 PgC; {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}; {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_2 Section 6.3.2.2}). {cite.6.'House_et_al_2002 House et al. (2002)} estimated that the atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2100 would be lowered by only about 40 to 70 ppm in that scenario (accounting for the ‘rebound’ effect).

The capacity for enhancing the soil carbon content on agricultural and degraded lands was estimated by one study at 50 to 60% of the historical soil carbon released, that is 42 to 78 PgC ({cite.6.'Lal_2004a}). The proposed agricultural practices are the adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses and nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure. Recent estimates suggest a cumulative potential of 30 to 60 PgC of additional storage over 25 to 50 years ({cite.6.'Lal_2004b}).

Finally, biochar and biomass burial methods aim to store organic carbon into very long {Glossary.*Turnover_time_T turnover time} ecosystem carbon pools. The maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar cumulative {Glossary.*Sequestration sequestration} is estimated at 130 PgC over a century by one study ({cite.6.'Woolf_et_al_2010}). The residence time of carbon converted to biochar and the additional effect of biochar on soil productivity are uncertain, and further research is required to assess the potential of this method ({cite.6.'Shepherd_et_al_2009}).
