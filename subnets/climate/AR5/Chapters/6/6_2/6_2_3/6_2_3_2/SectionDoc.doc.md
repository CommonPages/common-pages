title: 6.2.3.2 - Mechanisms Controlling Methane and Nitrous Oxide during the Last Millennium

Recent high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ice core records confirm a {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} decrease in the late 16th century by about 40 ppb (MacFarling-Meure et al., 2006; {cite.6.'Mitchell_et_al_2011}), as shown in {'Figure_6_7 Figure 6.7}. Correlations between this drop in atmospheric CH4 and the lower temperatures reconstructed during the 15th and 16th centuries suggest that climate change may have reduced CH4 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} by wetlands during this period. In addition to changes in the wetland CH4 {Glossary.*Source source}, changes in {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning have been invoked to explain the last millennium CH4 record ({cite.6.'Ferretti_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Mischler_et_al_2009}), ice core CO and CO {Glossary.*Isotopes isotopes} ({cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2010b}) and global {Glossary.*Charcoal charcoal} depositions ({cite.6.'Marlon_et_al_2008}). Changes in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CH4 emissions during times of war and plague hypothetically contributed to variability in atmospheric CH4 concentration ({cite.6.'Mitchell_et_al_2011}). {Glossary.*Ice_core Ice core} δ13CH4 measurements suggested pronounced variability in both natural and anthropogenic CH4 sources over the 1000–1800 period ({cite.6.'Sapart_et_al_2012}). No studies are known about mechanisms of {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} changes for the last millennium.
