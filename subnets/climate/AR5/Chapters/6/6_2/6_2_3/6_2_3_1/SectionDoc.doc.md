title: 6.2.3.1 - A Decrease of Carbon Dioxide around Year 1600 and Possible Explanations for this Event

High {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ice cores records reveal that atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} during the last millennium varied with a drop in atmospheric CO2 concentration by 7 to 10 ppm around year 1600, followed by a CO2 increase during the 17th century ({cite.6.'Trudinger_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Siegenthaler_et_al_2005a}; MacFarling-Meure et al., 2006; {cite.6.'Ahn_et_al_2012}). This is shown in {'Figure_6_7 Figure 6.7}. The CO2 decrease during the 17th century was used to evaluate the response of atmospheric CO2 concentration to a century-scale shift in global temperature ({cite.6.'Scheffer_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Cox_and_Jones_2008}; {cite.6.'Frank_et_al_2010}) which was found to be dependent on the choice of global temperature reconstructions used in the model.

One of the possible explanations for the drop in atmospheric CO2 around year 1600 is enhanced land and/or ocean carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} in response to the cooling caused by reduced solar irradiance during the Maunder Minimum ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_3 Section 5.3.5.3}). However, simulations using {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models of Intermediate Complexity ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs})({cite.6.'Gerber_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Brovkin_et_al_2004}) and by complex Earth System Models ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs}) ({cite.6.'Jungclaus_et_al_2010}) suggest that solar irradiance {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} alone is not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the CO2 decrease. The drop in atmospheric CO2 around year 1600 could also be caused by a cooling from increased volcanic eruptions ({cite.6.'Jones_and_Cox_2001}; {cite.6.'Brovkin_et_al_2010}; Frölicher et al., 2011). A third hypothesis calls for a link between CO2 and epidemics and wars associated with {Glossary.*Forest forest} regrowth over abandoned lands and increased carbon storage, especially in Central America. Here, results are model and scenario dependent. Simulations by {cite.6.'Pongratz_et_al_2011a Pongratz et al. (2011a)} do not reproduce a decrease in CO2, while simulations by {cite.6.'Kaplan_et_al_2011 Kaplan et al. (2011)} suggest a considerable increase in land carbon storage around year 1600. The temporal resolution of Central American {Glossary.*Charcoal charcoal} and pollen records is insufficient to support or falsify these model results (e.g., {cite.6.'Nevle_and_Bird_2008}; {cite.6.'Marlon_et_al_2008}).

{Glossary.*Ensemble Ensemble} simulations over the last 1200 years have been conducted using an ESM ({cite.6.'Jungclaus_et_al_2010}) and EMICs ({cite.6.'Eby_et_al_2013}) including a fully interactive {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. The sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 concentration to NH temperature changes in ESM was modeled to be of 2.7 to 4.4 ppm °C–1, while EMICs show on average a higher sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 to global temperature changes of 8.6 ppm °C–1.These sensitivities fall within the range of 1.7 to 21.4 ppm °C–1 of a recent {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} based on tree-ring NH temperature reconstructions ({cite.6.'Frank_et_al_2010}).
