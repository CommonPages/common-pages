title: 6.2.1.3 - Processes Controlling Changes in Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide During Abrupt Glacial Events
section 6_2_1_3

  |{Glossary.*Ice_core Ice core} measurements of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} show sharp (millennial-scale) changes in the course of glaciations. Conflicting hypotheses exist on the drivers of these changes.
