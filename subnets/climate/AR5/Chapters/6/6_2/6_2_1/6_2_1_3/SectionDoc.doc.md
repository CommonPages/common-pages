title: 6.2.1.3 - Processes Controlling Changes in Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide During Abrupt Glacial Events

{Glossary.*Ice_core Ice core} measurements of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} show sharp (millennial-scale) changes in the course of glaciations, associated with the so-called Dansgaard/Oeschger (DO) climatic events (see {Chapters.5.5_7 Section 5.7}), but their amplitude, shape and timing differ. During these millennial scale climate events, atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied by about 20 ppm, in phase with Antarctic, but not with Greenland temperatures. CO2 increased during cold (stadial) periods in Greenland, several thousands years before the time of the rapid warming event in Greenland ({cite.6.'Ahn_and_Brook_2008}). CH4 and N2O showed rapid transitions in phase with Greenland temperatures with little or no lag. CH4 changes are in the 50 to 200 ppb range (Flückiger et al., 2004), in phase with Greenland temperature warming at a decadal time scale ({cite.6.'Huber_et_al_2006}). N2O changes are large, of same magnitude than glacial–interglacial changes, and for the warmest and longest DO events N2O starts to increase several centuries before Greenland temperature and CH4 ({cite.6.'Schilt_et_al_2010b}).

Conflicting hypotheses exist on the drivers of these millennial-scale changes. Some model simulations suggest that both CO2 and N2O fluctuations can be explained by changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning ocean circulation ({cite.6.'Schmittner_and_Galbraith_2008}), CO2 variations being explained mainly by changes in the efficiency of the {Glossary.*Biological_pump biological pump} which affects deep ocean carbon storage ({cite.6.'Bouttes_et_al_2011}), whereas N2O variations could be due to changes in productivity and oxygen concentrations in the subsurface ocean ({cite.6.'Schmittner_and_Galbraith_2008}). Other studies, however, suggest that the millennial-scale CO2 fluctuations can be explained by changes in the land carbon storage ({cite.6.'Menviel_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Bozbiyik_et_al_2011}). For CH4, models have difficulties in reproducing changes in wetland {Topics.*Emissions emissions} compatible with DO atmospheric variations ({cite.6.'Hopcroft_et_al_2011}), and the changes in the atmospheric oxidizing capacity of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} during DO events seem to be too weak to explain the CH4 changes ({cite.6.'Levine_et_al_2012}).
