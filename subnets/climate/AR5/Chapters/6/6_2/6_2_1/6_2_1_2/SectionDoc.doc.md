title: 6.2.1.2 - Processes Controlling Glacial Methane and Nitrous Oxide

{Glossary.*Ice_core Ice core} measurements show that atmospheric {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} were much lower under glacial conditions compared to interglacial ones. Their reconstructed history encompasses the last 800 ka ({cite.6.'Loulergue_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Schilt_et_al_2010a}). Glacial CH4 mixing ratios are in the 350 to 400 ppb range during the eight glacial maxima covered by the ice core record. This is about half the levels observed during interglacial conditions. The N2O concentration amounts to 202 ± 8 ppb at the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}, compared to the early {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} levels of about 270 ppb (Flückiger et al., 1999).

CH4 and N2O isotopic ratio measurements in ice cores provide important constraints on the mechanisms responsible for their temporal changes. N2O {Glossary.*Isotopes isotopes} suggest a similar increase in marine and terrestrial N2O {Topics.*Emissions emissions} during the last {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} ({cite.6.'Sowers_et_al_2003}). Marine sediment proxies of ocean oxygenation suggest that most of the observed N2O deglacial rise was of marine origin ({cite.6.'Jaccard_and_Galbraith_2012}). δD and {Glossary.*14C 14C} isotopic composition measurements of CH4 have shown that catastrophic methane hydrate degassing events are unlikely to have caused the last deglaciation CH4 increase ({cite.6.'Sowers_2006}; {cite.6.'Petrenko_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Bock_et_al_2010}). δ13C and δD measurements of CH4 combined with interpolar atmospheric CH4 gradient changes (Greenland minus Antarctica ice cores) suggest that most of the deglacial CH4 increase was caused by increased emissions from boreal and tropical wetlands and an increase in CH4 atmospheric residence time due to a reduced oxidative capacity of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.6.'Fischer_et_al_2008}). The {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning {Glossary.*Source source} apparently changed little on the same time scale, whereas this CH4 source experienced large fluctuations over the last millennium ({cite.6.'Mischler_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2010b}). Recent modelling studies, however, suggest that changes in the atmospheric oxidising capacity of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} at the LGM are probably negligible compared to changes in sources ({cite.6.'Levine_et_al_2011}) and that tropical temperature influencing tropical wetlands and global vegetation were the dominant controls for CH4 atmospheric changes on glacial–interglacial time scales ({cite.6.'Konijnendijk_et_al_2011}).
