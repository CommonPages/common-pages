title: 6.2.1.1.4 - Ocean circulation and sea ice

Reorganization in ocean circulation during glacial periods that promoted the retention of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep ocean during the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} has become the focus of most research on the glacial–interglacial {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} problem. That ocean circulation plays a key role in low glacial period atmospheric CO2 concentration is exemplified by the tight coupling observed between reconstructed deep ocean temperatures and atmospheric CO2 ({cite.6.'Shackleton_2000}). Evidence from marine bore hole sites ({cite.6.'Adkins_et_al_2002}) and from marine sediment cores ({cite.6.'Jaccard_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Skinner_et_al_2010}) show that the glacial ocean was highly stratified compared to interglacial conditions and may thus have held a larger store of carbon during glacial times. δ13CO2 {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records ({cite.6.'Lourantou_et_al_2010a}, 2010b; {cite.6.'Schmitt_et_al_2012}), as well as radiocarbon records from deep-sea corals demonstrate the role of a deep and stratified Southern Ocean in the higher LGM ocean carbon storage. However, conflicting hypotheses exist on the drivers of this increase in the Southern Ocean stratification, for example, northward shift and weakening of Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerly winds ({cite.6.'Toggweiler_et_al_2006}), reduced air–sea buoyancy fluxes ({cite.6.'Watson_and_Garabato_2006}) or massive brine rejections during {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} formation ({cite.6.'Bouttes_et_al_2011}, 2012). Ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} models have simulated a circulation-induced effect on LGM CO2 that can explain lower values than during interglacial by 3 ppm ({cite.6.'Bopp_et_al_2003}) to 57 ppm ({cite.6.'Toggweiler_1999}).

A long-standing hypothesis is that increased LGM sea ice cover acted as a barrier to air–sea gas exchange and hence reduced the ‘leakage’ of CO2 during winter months from the ocean to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} during glacial periods ({cite.6.'Broecker_and_Peng_1986}). However, concurrent changes in ocean circulation and biological productivity complicate the estimation of the impact of increased sea ice extent on LGM atmospheric CO2 (Kurahashi-Nakamura et al., 2007). With the exception of the results of an idealised box model ({cite.6.'Stephens_and_Keeling_2000}), ocean carbon models are relatively consistent in projecting a small effect of higher sea ice extent on maintaining atmospheric CO2 lower during LGM ({cite.6.'Archer_et_al_2003}).
