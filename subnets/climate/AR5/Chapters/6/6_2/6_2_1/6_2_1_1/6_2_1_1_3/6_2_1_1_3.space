title: 6.2.1.1.3 - Lower sea level and increased salinity
section 6_2_1_1_3

  |During the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}, {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} was about ~120 m lower than today. Lower sea level is estimated to contribute to higher {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} values by 15 ppm during the LGM, implying that other processes must explain the lower CO2 values measured in ice cores.
