title: 6.2.1.1 - Processes Controlling Glacial Carbon Dioxide

Ice cores recovered from the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} reveal that the concentration of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} at the Last Glacial Maximum ({Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}; see Glossary) at 21 ka was about one third lower than during the subsequent interglacial ({Glossary.*Holocene Holocene}) period started at 11.7 ka ({cite.6.'Delmas_et_al_1980}; {cite.6.'Neftel_et_al_1982}; {cite.6.'Monnin_et_al_2001}). Longer (to 800 ka) records exhibit similar features, with CO2 values of ~180 to 200 ppm during glacial intervals ({cite.6.'Petit_et_al_1999}). Prior to 420 ka, interglacial CO2 values were 240 to 260 ppm rather than 270 to 290 ppm after that date (Lüthi et al., 2008).

A variety of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} reconstructions as well as models of different complexity from conceptual to complex {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESM}; see Glossary) have been used to test hypotheses for the cause of lower LGM atmospheric CO2 concentrations (e.g., Köhler et al., 2005; {cite.6.'Sigman_et_al_2010}). The mechanisms of the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} during the LGM which lead to low atmospheric CO2 can be broken down by individual drivers ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}). It should be recognized, however, that this separation is potentially misleading, as many of the component drivers shown in {'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5} may combine nonlinearly ({cite.6.'Bouttes_et_al_2011}). Only well-established individual drivers are quantified ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}), and discussed here.
