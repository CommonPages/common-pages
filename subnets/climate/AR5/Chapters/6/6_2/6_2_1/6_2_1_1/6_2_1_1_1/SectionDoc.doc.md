title: 6.2.1.1.1 - Reduced land carbon

Despite local evidence of larger carbon storage in {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} regions during glacial periods ({cite.6.'Zimov_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Zech_et_al_2011}), the Î´13C record of ocean waters as preserved in benthic foraminiferal shells has been used to infer that global terrestrial carbon storage was reduced in glacial times, thus opposite to recorded changes in atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}. Data-based estimates of the deficit between {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} and pre-industrial land carbon storage range from a few hundreds to 1000 PgC (e.g., {cite.6.'Bird_et_al_1996}; {cite.6.'Ciais_et_al_2012}). Dynamic vegetation models tend to simulate values at the higher end (~800 PgC) ({cite.6.'Kaplan_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Otto_et_al_2002}) and indicate a role for the physiological effects of low CO2 on {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} at the LGM at least as large as that of colder and dryer climate conditions in determining the past extent of forests ({cite.6.'Prentice_and_Harrison_2009}).
