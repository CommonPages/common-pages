title: 6.2.1.1.5 - Iron fertilisation

Both marine and terrestrial sediment records indicate higher rates of deposition of dust and hence iron (Fe) supply at the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} ({cite.6.'Mahowald_et_al_2006}), implying a potential link between Fe fertilisation of marine productivity and lower glacial {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({cite.6.'Martin_1990}). However, despite the fact that ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} models generally employ similar reconstructions of glacial dust fluxes (i.e., {cite.6.'Mahowald_et_al_1999}; {cite.6.'Mahowald_et_al_2006}), there is considerable disagreement among them in the associated CO2 change. OGCM that include a description of the Fe cycle tend to cluster at the lower end of simulated CO2 changes between glacial and interglacial (e.g., Archer at al., 2000; {cite.6.'Bopp_et_al_2003}), whereas box models (e.g., {cite.6.'Watson_et_al_2000}) or {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models of Intermediate Complexity ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs}, e.g., {cite.6.'Brovkin_et_al_2007}) tend to produce CO2 changes which are at the higher end ({cite.6.'Parekh_et_al_2008}). An alternative view comes from inferences drawn from the timing and magnitude of changes in dust and CO2 in ice cores (RoÌˆthlisberger et al., 2004), assigning a 20 ppm limit for the lowering of CO2 during the LGM in response to an Southern Ocean Fe fertilisation effect, and a 8 ppm limit for the same effect in the North Pacific.
