title: 6.2.1.1.3 - Lower sea level and increased salinity

During the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}, {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} was about ~120 m lower than today, and this change in ocean volume had several well-understood effects on atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations. Lower sea level impacts the LGM ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} in two main ways. First, the resulting higher LGM ocean surface salinity causes atmospheric CO2 to be higher than during the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene}. Second, the total dissolved inorganic carbon and {Glossary.*Alkalinity alkalinity} (a measure of the capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize acid) become more concentrated in equal proportions, and this process also causes atmospheric CO2 to be higher during the LGM. In total, lower sea level is estimated to contribute to higher CO2 values by 15 ppm during the LGM ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}), implying that other processes must explain the lower CO2 values measured in ice cores.
