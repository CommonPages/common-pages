title: 6.2.1.1.7 - Summary

All of the major drivers of the glacial-to-interglacial atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} changes ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}) are likely to have already been identified. However, {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models have been unable to reproduce the full magnitude of the glacial-to-interglacial CO2 changes. Significant {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} exist in glacial boundary conditions and on some of the primary controls on carbon storage in the ocean and in the land. These uncertainties prevent an unambiguous {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of individual mechanisms as controllers of the low glacial CO2 concentrations. Further assessments of the interplay of different mechanisms prior to deglacial transitions or in glacial inceptions will provide additional insights into the drivers and processes that caused the glacial decrease of CO2. Because several of these identified drivers (e.g., organic matter {Glossary.*Mineralization_Remineralization remineralization}, ocean stratification) are sensitive to climate change in general, improved understanding drawn from the {Glossary.*Glacial_interglacial_cycles glacialâ€“interglacial cycles} will help constrain the magnitude of future ocean feedbacks on atmospheric CO2. Other drivers (e.g., iron fertilisation) are involved in {Glossary.*Geoengineering geoengineering} methods (see Glossary), such that improved understanding could also help constrain the potential and applicability of these methods (see {Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_2 Section 6.5.2}).
