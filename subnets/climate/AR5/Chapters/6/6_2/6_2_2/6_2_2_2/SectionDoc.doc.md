title: 6.2.2.2 - Holocene Methane and Nitrous Oxide Drivers

The atmospheric {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} levels decreased from the early {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} to about 6 ka, were lowest at around 5 ka, and increased between 5 ka and year 1750 by about 100 ppb ({'Figure_6_6 Figure 6.6}). Major Holocene agricultural developments, in particular rice paddy cultivation and widespread domestication of ruminants, have been proposed as an explanation for the Late Holocene CH4 rise ({cite.6.'Ruddiman_2007}). The most recent syntheses of archaeological data point to an increasing {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CH4 {Glossary.*Source source} from domesticated ruminants after 5 ka and from rice cultivation after 4 ka ({cite.6.'Ruddiman_2007}; {cite.6.'Fuller_et_al_2011}). The modelling support for either natural or anthropogenic explanations of the Late Holocene increase in the atmospheric CH4 concentration is equivocal. A study by {cite.6.'Kaplan_et_al_2006 Kaplan et al. (2006)} suggested that a part of the Late Holocene CH4 rise could be explained by anthropogenic sources. Natural wetland CH4 models driven by simulated climate changes are able ({cite.6.'Singarayer_et_al_2011}) or unable ({cite.6.'Konijnendijk_et_al_2011}) to simulate Late Holocene increase in the CH4 concentration, reflecting a large spread in present-day CH4 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} simulated by this type of models ({cite.6.'Melton_et_al_2013}; see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_3.6_3_3_2 Section 6.3.3.2}). Consequently, about as likely as not, the atmospheric CH4 increase after 5000 years ago can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to early {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities}. The mechanisms causing the {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} concentration changes during the Holocene are not firmly identified (FluÌˆckiger et al., 2002).
