title: 6.2.2.1.1 - Oceanic processes

The change in oceanic carbonate chemistry could explain the slow atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increase during the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} since 7 ka. Proposed mechanisms include: (1) a shift of oceanic carbonate sedimentation from deep sea to the shallow waters due to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise onto continental shelves causing {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} of CaCO3 on shelves including coral reef growth, a process that releases CO2 to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.6.'Ridgwell_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Kleinen_et_al_2010}), (2) a ‘carbonate compensation’ in response to the release of carbon from the deep ocean during {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} and to the buildup of terrestrial {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} in the early Holocene ({cite.6.'Broecker_et_al_1999}; {cite.6.'Joos_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Elsig_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Menviel_and_Joos_2012}). Proxies for carbonate ion concentration in the deep sea ({cite.6.'Yu_et_al_2010}) and a decrease in modern CaCO3 preservation in equatorial Pacific sediments ({cite.6.'Anderson_et_al_2008}) support the hypothesis that the ocean was a {Glossary.*Source source} of CO2 to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} during the Holocene. Changes in SSTs over the last 7 kyr ({cite.6.'Kim_et_al_2004}) could have contributed to slightly lower ({cite.6.'Brovkin_et_al_2008}) or higher ({cite.6.'Menviel_and_Joos_2012}) atmospheric CO2 concentration but, very likely, {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}-driven CO2 change represents only a minor contribution to the observed CO2 increase during the Holocene after 7 ka ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}).
