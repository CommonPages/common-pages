title: 6.2.2.1 - Understanding Processes Underlying Holocene Carbon Dioxide Changes

The evolution of the atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} concentrations during the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene}, the interglacial period which began 11.7 ka, is known with high certainty from {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} measurements ({'Figure_6_6 Figure 6.6}). A decrease in atmospheric CO2 of about 7 ppm is measured in ice cores between 11 and 7 ka, followed by a 20 ppm CO2 increase until the onset of the Industrial Era in 1750 (IndermuÌˆhle et al., 1999; {cite.6.'Monnin_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Elsig_et_al_2009}). These variations in atmospheric CO2 over the past 11 kyr preceding industrialisation are more than five times smaller than the CO2 increase observed during the Industrial Era (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_3 Section 6.3.2.3}). Despite the small magnitude of CO2 variations prior to the Industrial Era, these changes are nevertheless useful for understanding the role of natural {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} in carbon and other biogeochemical cycles during interglacial climate conditions.

Since the IPCC {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the mechanisms underlying the observed 20 ppm CO2 increase between 7 ka and the Industrial Era have been a matter of intensive debate. During three interglacial periods prior to the Holocene, CO2 did not increase, and this led to a hypothesis that pre-industrial {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} could be associated with early {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} and {Glossary.*Forest forest} clearing ({cite.6.'Ruddiman_2003}, 2007). However, ice core CO2 data ({cite.6.'Siegenthaler_et_al_2005b}) indicate that during Marine Isotope Stage 11 (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2 Section 5.2.2}), an interglacial period that lasted from 400 to 420 ka, CO2 increased similarly to the Holocene period. Drivers of atmospheric CO2 changes during the Holocene can be divided into oceanic and terrestrial processes ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}) and their roles are examined below.
