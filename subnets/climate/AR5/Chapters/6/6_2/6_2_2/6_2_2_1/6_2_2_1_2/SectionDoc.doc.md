title: 6.2.2.1.2 - Terrestrial processes

The δ13C of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} trapped in ice cores can be used to infer changes in terrestrial biospheric carbon pools. Calculations based on inferred δ13C of atmospheric CO2 during the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} suggest an increase in terrestrial carbon storage of about 300 PgC between 11 and 5 ka and small overall terrestrial changes thereafter ({cite.6.'Elsig_et_al_2009}). Modelling studies suggest that CO2 fertilisation ({Box_6_3 Box 6.3}) in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration after 7 ka contributed to a substantially increased terrestrial carbon storage (>100 PgC) on Holocene time scales ({cite.6.'Kaplan_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Joos_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Kleinen_et_al_2010}). Orbitally forced {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, including the intensification and decline of the Afro-Asian {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} and the mid-Holocene warming of the high latitudes of the NH are estimated in models to have caused changes in vegetation distribution and hence of terrestrial carbon storage. These climate-induced carbon storage changes are estimated using models to have been smaller than the increase due to CO2 fertilisation ({cite.6.'Brovkin_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Schurgers_et_al_2006}). The Holocene {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} of carbon in peatlands has been reconstructed globally, suggesting a land carbon additional storage of several hundred petagrams of carbon between the early Holocene and the Industrial Era, although {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} remain on this estimate ({cite.6.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Yu_2011}; {cite.6.'Kleinen_et_al_2012}). Volcanic CO2 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} between 12 and 7 ka were estimated to be two to six times higher than during the last millennium, of about 0.1 PgC yr–1 ({cite.6.'Huybers_and_Langmuir_2009}; {cite.6.'Roth_and_Joos_2012}). However, a peak in the inferred volcanic emissions coincides with the period of decreasing atmospheric CO2 and the confidence in changes of volcanic CO2 emissions is low.

Global syntheses of the observational, paleoecological and archaeological records for Holocene {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} are not currently available ({cite.6.'Gaillard_et_al_2010}). Available reconstructions of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} land use and land cover change (LULCC) prior to the last millennium currently extrapolate using models and assumptions from single regions to changes in all regions of the world ({cite.6.'Goldewijk_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Kaplan_et_al_2011}). Because of regional differences in land use systems and uncertainty in historical population estimates, the confidence in spatially explicit LULCC reconstructions is low.

Some recent studies focused on reconstructing LULCC and making very simple assumptions regarding the effect of land use on carbon ({cite.6.'Olofsson_and_Hickler_2008}; {cite.6.'Lemmen_2009}). Other studies relied on more sophisticated terrestrial {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} models to simulate carbon storage and loss in response to pre-industrial LULCC during the late Holocene ({cite.6.'Strassmann_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Pongratz_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Stocker_et_al_2011}). The conclusion of the aforementioned studies was that cumulative Holocene carbon emissions as a result of pre-industrial LULCC were not large enough (~50 to 150 PgC during the Holocene before 1850) to have had an influence larger than an increase of ~10 ppm on late Holocene observed CO2 concentration increase ({'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}). However, a modelling study by {cite.6.'Kaplan_et_al_2011 Kaplan et al. (2011)} suggested that more than 350 PgC could have been released as a result of LULCC between 8 ka and 1850 as a result of a much stronger loss of soil carbon in response to land use change, than in other studies.

In addition to clearing of forests, large-scale {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning activity, inferred from synthesized {Glossary.*Charcoal charcoal} records and bog sediments has been hypothesized to correlate with the observed Late Holocene atmospheric CO2 ({cite.6.'Carcaillet_et_al_2002}). A global extensive synthesis of charcoal records for the last 21 kyr ({cite.6.'Power_et_al_2008}) and updates of those shows that fire activity followed climate variability on global ({cite.6.'Marlon_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Daniau_et_al_2012}) and regional scale ({cite.6.'Archibald_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Mooney_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Marlon_et_al_2012}; {cite.6.'Power_et_al_2013}). There is no evidence, however, for a distinct change in fire activity linked to human activity alone as hypothesized from a regional charcoal record synthesis for the tropical Americas ({cite.6.'Nevle_and_Bird_2008}; {cite.6.'Nevle_et_al_2011}). Fire being a newly studied component, no estimate for its role is given in {'Figure_6_5 Figure 6.5}.
