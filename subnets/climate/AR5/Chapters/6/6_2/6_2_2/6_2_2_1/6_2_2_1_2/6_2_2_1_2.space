  |The Î´13C of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} trapped in ice cores can be used to infer changes in terrestrial biospheric carbon pools. Calculations suggest an increase in terrestrial carbon storage of about 300 PgC between 11,000 and 5,0000 years ago, and small overall terrestrial changes thereafter.
