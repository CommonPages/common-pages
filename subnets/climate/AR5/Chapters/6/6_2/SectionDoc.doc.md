title: 6.2 - Variations in Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles Before the Fossil Fuel Era

The {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} mechanisms that were responsible for {Topics.*Past_Climate past variations} in atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} will probably operate in the future as well. Past archives of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and climate therefore provide useful knowledge, including constraints for biogeochemical models applied to the future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} described in {Chapters.6.6_4 Section 6.4}. In addition, past archives of GHGs also show with very high confidence that the average rates of increase of CO2, CH4 and N2O are larger during the Industrial Era (see {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}) than during any comparable period of at least the past 22,000 years ({cite.6.'Joos_and_Spahni_2008}).
