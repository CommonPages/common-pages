title: 6.1 - Introduction

The radiative properties of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} are strongly influenced by the abundance of {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect well-mixed GHGs} (see Glossary), mainly carbon dioxide ({Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}), methane ({Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}) and nitrous oxide ({Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}), which have substantially increased since the beginning of the Industrial Era (defined as beginning in the year 1750), due primarily to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (see {Chapters.2 Chapter 2}). Well-mixed {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} represent the gaseous phase of global biogeochemical cycles, which control the complex flows and transformations of the elements between the different components of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} (atmosphere, ocean, land, lithosphere) by biotic and abiotic processes. Since most of these processes are themselves also dependent on the prevailing environment, changes in climate and human impacts on ecosystems (e.g., land use and {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}) also modify the atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O. During the glacial-interglacial cycles (see Glossary), in absence of significant direct human impacts, long variations in climate also affected CO2, CH4 and N2O and vice versa (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}, {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2 Section 5.2.2}). In the coming century, the situation would be quite different, because of the dominance of anthropogenic emissions that affect global biogeochemical cycles, and in turn, climate change (see {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}). Biogeochemical cycles thus constitute feedbacks in the Earth System.

This chapter summarizes the scientific understanding of atmospheric budgets, variability and trends of the three major biogeochemical greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O, their underlying {Glossary.*Source source} and {Glossary.*Sink sink} processes and their perturbations caused by direct human impacts, past and present climate changes as well as future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of climate change. After the introduction ({Chapters.6.6_1 Section 6.1}), {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2} assesses the present understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the variations of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the past emphasizing glacial-interglacial changes, and the smaller variations during the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} (see Glossary) since the last glaciation and over the last millennium. {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3} focuses on the Industrial Era addressing the major source and sink processes, and their variability in space and time. This information is then used to evaluate critically the models of the biogeochemical cycles, including their sensitivity to changes in atmospheric composition and climate. {Chapters.6.6_4 Section 6.4} assesses future projections of carbon and other biogeochemical cycles computed, in particular, with CMIP5 Earth System Models. This includes a quantitative assessment of the direction and magnitude of the various {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} mechanisms as represented in current models, as well as additional processes that might become important in the future but which are not yet fully understood. Finally, {Chapters.6.6_5 Section 6.5} addresses the potential effects and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} of deliberate {Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal carbon dioxide removal} methods (see Glossary) and {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} management (see Glossary) on the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}.
