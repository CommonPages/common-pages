title: 6.1.1.1 - Carbon Dioxide and the Global Carbon Cycle

Atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} represents the main atmospheric phase of the global {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. The global carbon cycle can be viewed as a series of reservoirs of carbon in the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System}, which are connected by exchange fluxes of carbon. Conceptually, one can distinguish two domains in the global carbon cycle. The first is a fast domain with large exchange fluxes and relatively ‘rapid’ reservoir turnovers, which consists of carbon in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, the ocean, surface ocean sediments and on land in vegetation, soils and freshwaters. {Glossary.*Reservoir Reservoir} turnover times, defined as reservoir mass of carbon divided by the exchange flux, range from a few years for the atmosphere to decades to millennia for the major carbon reservoirs of the land vegetation and soil and the various domains in the ocean. A second, slow domain consists of the huge carbon stores in rocks and sediments which exchange carbon with the fast domain through volcanic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of CO2, chemical {Glossary.*Weathering weathering} (see Glossary), erosion and sediment formation on the sea floor ({cite.6.'Sundquist_1986}). Turnover times of the (mainly geological) reservoirs of the slow domain are 10,000 years or longer. Natural exchange fluxes between the slow and the fast domain of the carbon cycle are relatively small (<0.3 PgC yr–1, 1 PgC = 1015 gC) and can be assumed as approximately constant in time (volcanism, sedimentation) over the last few centuries, although erosion and river fluxes may have been modified by human-induced changes in land use ({cite.6.'Raymond_and_Cole_2003}).

During the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} (beginning 11,700 years ago) prior to the Industrial Era the fast domain was close to a steady state, as evidenced by the relatively small variations of atmospheric CO2 recorded in ice cores (see {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2}), despite small emissions from human-caused changes in land use over the last millennia ({cite.6.'Pongratz_et_al_2009}). By contrast, since the beginning of the Industrial Era, fossil fuel extraction from geological reservoirs, and their combustion, has resulted in the transfer of significant amount of fossil carbon from the slow domain into the fast domain, thus causing an unprecedented, major human-induced perturbation in the carbon cycle. A schematic of the global carbon cycle with focus on the fast domain is shown in {'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}. The numbers represent the estimated current pool sizes in PgC and the magnitude of the different exchange fluxes in PgC yr–1 averaged over the time period 2000–2009 (see {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}).

In the atmosphere, CO2 is the dominant carbon bearing trace gas with a current (2011) concentration of approximately 390.5 ppm ({cite.6.'Dlugokencky_and_Tans_2013a}), which corresponds to a mass of 828 PgC ({cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012}; {cite.6.'Joos_et_al_2013}). Additional trace gases include methane ({Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, current content mass ~3.7 PgC) and carbon monoxide (CO, current content mass ~0.2 PgC), and still smaller amounts of hydrocarbons, {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon} aerosols and organic compounds.

The terrestrial {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} reservoir contains carbon in organic compounds in vegetation living {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} (450 to 650 PgC; {cite.6.'Prentice_et_al_2001}) and in dead organic matter in litter and soils (1500 to 2400 PgC; {cite.6.'Batjes_1996}). There is an additional amount of old soil carbon in wetland soils (300 to 700 PgC; {cite.6.'Bridgham_et_al_2006}) and in {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} soils (see Glossary) (~1700 PgC; {cite.6.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}); albeit some overlap with these two quantities. CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by plant {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} (Gross Primary Production ({Glossary.*Gross_Primary_Production GPP}), 123±8 PgC yr–1, (Beer et al., 2010)) and carbon fixed into plants is then cycled through plant tissues, litter and soil carbon and can be released back into the atmosphere by autotrophic (plant) and heterotrophic (soil microbial and animal) {Glossary.*Respiration respiration} and additional disturbance processes (e.g., sporadic fires) on a very wide range of time scales (seconds to millennia). Because CO2 {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} by photosynthesis occurs only during the growing season, whereas CO2 release by respiration occurs nearly yearround, the greater land mass in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) imparts a characteristic ‘sawtooth’ seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO2 ({cite.6.'Keeling_1960}) (see {'Figure_6_3 Figure 6.3}). A significant amount of terrestrial carbon (1.7 PgC yr–1; {'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}) is transported from soils to rivers headstreams. A fraction of this carbon is outgassed as CO2 by rivers and lakes to the atmosphere, a fraction is buried in freshwater organic sediments and the remaining amount (~0.9 PgC yr–1; {'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}) is delivered by rivers to the coastal ocean as dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon ({cite.6.'Tranvik_et_al_2009}).

Atmospheric CO2 is exchanged with the surface ocean through gas exchange. This exchange flux is driven by the partial CO2 pressure difference between the air and the sea. In the ocean, carbon is available predominantly as Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC, ~38,000 PgC; {'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}), that is carbonic acid (dissolved CO2 in water), bicarbonate and carbonate ions, which are tightly coupled via ocean chemistry. In addition, the ocean contains a pool of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC, ~700 PgC), of which a substantial fraction has a {Glossary.*Turnover_time_T turnover time} of 1000 years or longer ({cite.6.'Hansell_et_al_2009}). The marine biota, predominantly phytoplankton and other microorganisms, represent a small organic carbon pool (~3 PgC), which is turned over very rapidly in days to a few weeks.

Carbon is transported within the ocean by three mechanisms ({'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}): (1) the ‘{Glossary.*Solubility_pump solubility pump}’ (see Glossary), (2) the ‘{Glossary.*Biological_pump biological pump}’ (see Glossary), and (3) the ‘marine carbonate pump’ that is generated by the formation of calcareous shells of certain oceanic microorganisms in the surface ocean, which, after sinking to depth, are re-mineralized back into DIC and calcium ions. The marine carbonate pump operates counter to the marine biological soft-tissue pump with respect to its effect on CO2: in the formation of calcareous shells, two bicarbonate ions are split into one carbonate and one dissolved CO2 molecules, which increases the partial CO2 pressure in surface waters (driving a release of CO2 to the atmosphere). Only a small fraction (~0.2 PgC yr–1) of the carbon exported by biological processes (both soft-tissue and carbonate pumps) from the surface reaches the sea floor where it can be stored in sediments for millennia and longer ({cite.6.'Denman_et_al_2007}).
