title: 6.1.1.2 - Methane Cycle

{Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} absorbs {Glossary.*Infrared_radiation infrared radiation} relatively stronger per molecule compared to {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}), and it interacts with photochemistry. On the other hand, the methane {Glossary.*Turnover_time_T turnover time} (see Glossary) is less than 10 years in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012}; see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). The sources of CH4 at the surface of the Earth (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_3.6_3_3_2 Section 6.3.3.2}) can be thermogenic including (1) natural {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of fossil CH4 from geological sources (marine and terrestrial seepages, geothermal vents and mud volcanoes) and (2) emissions caused by leakages from fossil fuel extraction and use (natural gas, coal and oil industry; {'Figure_6_2 Figure 6.2}). There are also pyrogenic sources resulting from incomplete burning of fossil fuels and plant {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} (both natural and anthropogenic fires). The biogenic sources include natural biogenic emissions predominantly from wetlands, from termites and very small emissions from the ocean (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_3 Section 6.3.3}). {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} biogenic emissions occur from rice paddy agriculture, ruminant livestock, landfills, man-made lakes and wetlands and waste treatment. In general, biogenic CH4 is produced from organic matter under low oxygen conditions by fermentation processes of methanogenic microbes ({cite.6.'Conrad_1996}). Atmospheric CH4 is removed primarily by photochemistry, through atmospheric chemistry reactions with the OH radicals. Other smaller removal processes of atmospheric CH4 take place in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} through reaction with chlorine and oxygen radicals, by oxidation in well aerated soils, and possibly by reaction with chlorine in the marine boundary layer ({cite.6.'Allan_et_al_2007}; see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_3.6_3_3_3 Section 6.3.3.3}).

A very large geological {Glossary.*Stock stock} (globally 1500 to 7000 PgC, that is 2 x 106 to 9.3 x 106 Tg(CH4) in {'Figure_6_2 Figure 6.2}; {cite.6.'Archer_2007 Archer (2007)}; with low confidence in estimates) of CH4 exists in the form of frozen hydrate deposits (‘clathrates’) in shallow ocean sediments and on the slopes of continental shelves, and {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} soils. These CH4 hydrates are stable under conditions of low temperature and high pressure. Warming or changes in pressure could render some of these hydrates unstable with a potential release of CH4 to the overlying soil/ocean and/or {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Possible future CH4 emissions from CH4 released by gas hydrates are discussed in {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_7.6_4_7_3 Section 6.4.7.3}.
