title: 6.1.3.2 - Oxygen

Atmospheric oxygen is tightly coupled with the global {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} (sometimes called a mirror of the carbon cycle). The burning of fossil fuels removes oxygen from the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} in a tightly defined stoichiometric ratio depending on fuel carbon content. As a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels, atmospheric O2 levels have been observed to decrease steadily over the last 20 years ({cite.6.'Keeling_and_Shertz_1992}; {cite.6.'Manning_and_Keeling_2006}) ({'Figure_6_3 Figure 6.3}b). Compared to the atmospheric oxygen content of about 21% this decrease is very small; however, it provides independent evidence that the rise in {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} must be due to an oxidation process, that is, fossil fuel combustion and/or organic carbon oxidation, and is not caused by, for example, volcanic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} or by outgassing of dissolved CO2 from a warming ocean. The atmospheric oxygen measurements furthermore also show the north–south concentration O2 difference (higher in the south and mirroring the CO2 north–south concentration difference) as expected from the stronger fossil fuel consumption in the NH ({cite.6.'Keeling_et_al_1996}).

On land, during {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} and {Glossary.*Respiration respiration}, O2 and CO2 are exchanged in nearly a 1:1 ratio. However, with respect to exchanges with the ocean, O2 behaves quite differently from CO2, because compared to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} only a small amount of O2 is dissolved in the ocean whereas by contrast the oceanic CO2 content is much larger due to the carbonate chemistry. This different behaviour of the two gases with respect to ocean exchange provides a powerful method to assess independently the partitioning of the {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 by land and ocean ({cite.6.'Manning_and_Keeling_2006}), {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_3 Section 6.3.2.3}.
