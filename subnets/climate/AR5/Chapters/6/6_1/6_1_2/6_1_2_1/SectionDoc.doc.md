title: 6.1.2.1 - Carbon Dioxide and the Global Carbon Cycle

Since the beginning of the Industrial Era, humans have been producing energy by burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), a process that is releasing large amounts of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} into the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.6.'Rotty_1983}; {cite.6.'Boden_et_al_2011}; see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_1 Section 6.3.2.1}). The amount of fossil fuel CO2 emitted to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} can be estimated with an accuracy of about 5 to 10% for recent decades from statistics of fossil fuel use ({cite.6.'Andres_et_al_2012}). Total cumulative {Topics.*Emissions emissions} between 1750 and 2011 amount to 375 ± 30 PgC (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_1 Section 6.3.2.1} and {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}), including a contribution of 8 PgC from the production of cement.

The second major {Glossary.*Source source} of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is caused by changes in land use (mainly {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation}), which causes globally a net reduction in land carbon storage, although recovery from past {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} can cause a net gain in in land carbon storage in some regions. Estimation of this CO2 source to the atmosphere requires knowledge of changes in land area as well as estimates of the carbon stored per area before and after the land use change. In addition, longer term effects, such as the decomposition of soil organic matter after land use change, have to be taken into account (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_2 Section 6.3.2.2}). Since 1750, anthropogenic land use changes have resulted into about 50 million km2 being used for cropland and pasture, corresponding to about 38% of the total ice-free land area ({cite.6.'Foley_et_al_2007}, 2011), in contrast to an estimated cropland and pasture area of 7.5 to 9 million km2 about 1750 ({cite.6.'Ramankutty_and_Foley_1999}; {cite.6.'Goldewijk_2001}). The cumulative net CO2 emissions from land use changes between 1750 and 2011 are estimated at approximately 180 ± 80 PgC (see {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3} and {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}).

{Topics.*Evidence_of_Change Multiple lines of evidence} indicate that the observed atmospheric increase in the global CO2 concentration since 1750 ({'Figure_6_3 Figure 6.3}) is caused by the anthropogenic CO2 emissions (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_3 Section 6.3.2.3}). The rising atmospheric CO2 content induces a disequilibrium in the exchange fluxes between the atmosphere and the land and oceans respectively. The rising CO2 concentration implies a rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) that induces a globally averaged net-airto-sea flux and thus an ocean {Glossary.*Sink sink} for CO2 (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5 Section 6.3.2.5}). On land, the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration fosters {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} via the CO2 fertilisation effect (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6 Section 6.3.2.6}). However, the {Glossary.*Efficacy efficacy} of these oceanic and terrestrial sinks does also depend on how the excess carbon is transformed and redistributed within these sink reservoirs. The magnitude of the current sinks is shown in {'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1} (averaged over the years 2000–2009, red arrows), together with the cumulative {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir} content changes over the industrial era (1750– 2011, red numbers) (see {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}, {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}).
