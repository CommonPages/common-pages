title: Box 6.2 - Nitrogen Cycle and Climate-Carbon Cycle Feedbacks

Human creation of reactive nitrogen by the Haber–Bosch process (see Sections {Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_3 6.1.3} and {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_4 6.3.4}), fossil fuel combustion and agricultural biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) dominate Nr creation relative to biological nitrogen fixation in natural terrestrial ecosystems. This dominance impacts on the radiation balance of the Earth (covered by the IPCC; see, e.g., Chapters {Chapters.7} and {Chapters.8}), and affects human health and {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} health as well ({cite.6.'EPA_2011b}; {cite.6.'Sutton_et_al_2011}).

The Nr creation from 1850 to 2005 is shown in {Box_6_2 Box 6.2} (Figure 1). After mid-1970s, human production of Nr exceeded natural production. During the 2000s food production (mineral fertilisers, legumes) accounts for three-quarters of Nr created by humans, with fossil fuel combustion and industrial uses accounting equally for the remainder ({cite.6.'Galloway_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Canfield_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Sutton_et_al_2011}).

The three most relevant questions regarding the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} perturbation of the nitrogen cycle with respect to global change are: (1) What are the interactions with the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, and the effects on carbon sinks (see Sections {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6.6_3_2_6_5 6.3.2.6.5} and {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_2.6_4_2_1 6.4.2.1}), (2) What are the effects of increased Nr on the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} of nitrate aerosols ({Chapters.7 Chapter 7}, 7.3.2) and tropospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}), (3) What are the impacts of the excess of Nr on humans and ecosystems (health, biodiversity, eutrophication, not treated in this report, but see, for example, {cite.6.'EPA_2011b}; {cite.6.'Sutton_et_al_2011}).

Essentially all of the Nr formed by human activity is spread into the environment, either at the point of creation (i.e., fossil fuel combustion) or after it is used in food production and in industry. Once in the environment, Nr has a number of negative impacts if not converted back into N2. In addition to its contributions to climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion, Nr contributes to the formation of smog; increases the haziness of the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}; contributes to the acidification of soils and freshwaters; and increases the productivity in forests, grasslands, open and coastal waters and open ocean, which can lead to eutrophication and reduction in biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In addition, Nr-induced increases in nitrogen oxides, aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and nitrates in drinking water have negative impacts on human health ({cite.6.'Galloway_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Davidson_et_al_2012}). Once the nitrogen atoms become reactive (e.g., NH3, NOx), any given Nr atom can contribute to all of the impacts noted above in sequence. This is called the nitrogen cascade ({cite.6.'Galloway_et_al_2003}; {Box_6_2 Box 6.2}, {'Box_6_2_Figure_2 Figure 2}). The nitrogen cascade is the sequential transfer of the same Nr atom through the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems and marine ecosystems that results in multiple effects in each {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir}. Because of the nitrogen cascade, the creation of any molecule of Nr from N2, at any location, has the potential to affect climate, either directly or indirectly, as explained in this box This potential exists until the Nr gets converted back to N2.

The most important processes causing direct links between anthropogenic Nr and climate change include ({cite.6.'Erisman_et_al_2011}): (1) {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} formation during industrial processes (e.g., fertiliser production), combustion, or microbial conversion of substrate containing nitrogen—notably after fertiliser and manure application to soils. N2O is a strong {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} (GHG), (2) emission of anthropogenic NOx leading to (a) formation of tropospheric O3, (which is the third most important GHG), (b) a decrease of {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and (c) the formation of nitrate aerosols. {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} formation affects radiative forcing, as nitrogen-containing aerosols have a direct cooling effect in addition to an indirect cooling effect through cloud formation and (3) NH3 emission to the atmosphere which contributes to aerosol formation. The first process has a warming effect. The second has both a warming (as a GHG) and a cooling (through the formation of the OH radical in the troposphere which reacts with CH4, and through aerosol formation) effect. The net effect of all three NOx-related contributions is cooling. The third process has a cooling effect.

The most important processes causing an indirect link between anthropogenic Nr and climate change include: (1) nitrogen-dependent changes in soil organic matter decomposition and hence {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, affecting heterotrophic {Glossary.*Respiration respiration}; (2) alteration of the biospheric CO2 {Glossary.*Sink sink} due to increased supply of Nr. About half of the carbon that is emitted to the atmosphere is taken up by the {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere}; Nr affects net CO2 {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} from the atmosphere in terrestrial systems, rivers, estuaries and the open ocean in a positive direction (by increasing productivity or reducing the rate of organic matter breakdown) and negative direction (in situations where it accelerates organic matter breakdown). CO2 uptake in the ocean causes {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification}, which reduces CO2 uptake; (3) changes in marine primary productivity, generally an increase, in response to Nr deposition; and (4) O3 formed in the troposphere as a result of NOx and volatile organic compound emissions reduces plant productivity, and therefore reduces CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. On the global scale the net influence of the direct and indirect contributions of Nr on the radiative balance was estimated to be –0.24 W m–2 (with an {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range of +0.2 to –0.5 W m–2) ({cite.6.'Erisman_et_al_2011}).

Nr is required for both plants and soil microorganisms to grow, and plant and microbial processes play important roles in the global carbon cycle. The increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 is observed to increase plant {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} (see {Box_6_3 Box 6.3}) and plant growth, which drives an increase of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Plant growth is, however, constrained by the availability of Nr in soils (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6.6_3_2_6_5 Section 6.3.2.6.5}). This means that in some nitrogen-poor ecosystems, insufficient Nr availability will limit carbon sinks, while the deposition of Nr may instead alleviate this limitation and enable larger carbon sinks (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6.6_3_2_6_5 Section 6.3.2.6.5}). Therefore, human production of Nr has the potential to mitigate CO2 emissions by providing additional nutrients for plant growth in some regions. Microbial growth can also be limited by the availability of Nr, particularly in cold, wet environments, so that human production of Nr also has the potential to accelerate the decomposition of organic matter, increasing release of CO2. The availability of Nr also changes in response to climate change, generally increasing with warmer temperatures and increased precipitation (see {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_2.6_4_2_1 Section 6.4.2.1}), but with complex interactions in the case of seasonally inundated environments. This complex network of feedbacks is amenable to study through observation and experimentation ({Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}) and {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} modelling ({Chapters.6.6_4 Section 6.4}). Even though we do not yet have a thorough understanding of how nitrogen and carbon cycling will interact with climate change, elevated CO2 and human Nr production in the future, given {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} of human activity, current observations and model results all indicate that low nitrogen availability will limit carbon storage on land in the 21st century (see {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_2.6_4_2_1 Section 6.4.2.1}).
