title: Box 6.3 - The Carbon Dioxide Fertilisation Effect

Elevated atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations lead to higher leaf {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} and reduced canopy transpiration, which in turn lead to increased plant water use efficiency and reduced fluxes of surface latent heat. The increase in leaf photosynthesis with rising CO2, the so-called CO2 fertilisation effect, plays a dominant role in terrestrial biogeochemical models to explain the global land carbon {Glossary.*Sink sink} ({cite.6.'Sitch_et_al_2008}), yet it is one of most unconstrained process in those models.

Field experiments provide a direct evidence of increased photosynthesis rates and water use efficiency (plant carbon gains per unit of water loss from transpiration) in plants growing under elevated CO2. These physiological changes translate into a broad range of higher plant carbon {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} in more than two-thirds of the experiments and with increased net primary productivity (NPP) of about 20 to 25% at double CO2 from pre-industrial concentrations ({cite.6.'Ainsworth_and_Long_2004}; {cite.6.'Luo_et_al_2004}, 2006; {cite.6.'Nowak_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Norby_et_al_2005};{cite.6.'Canadell_et_al_2007a}; {cite.6.'Denman_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Ainsworth_et_al_2012}; {cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2012a}). Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, new evidence is available from long-term Free-air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments in temperate ecosystems showing the capacity of ecosystems exposed to elevated CO2 to sustain higher rates of carbon accumulation over multiple years ({cite.6.'Liberloo_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'McCarthy_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Aranjuelo_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Dawes_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Lee_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Zak_et_al_2011}). However, FACE experiments also show the diminishing or lack of CO2 fertilisation effect in some ecosystems and for some plant species ({cite.6.'Dukes_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Adair_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Bader_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Norby_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Newingham_et_al_2013}). This lack of response occurs despite increased water use efficiency, also confirmed with tree ring evidence ({cite.6.'Gedalof_and_Berg_2010}; PenÌƒuelas et al., 2011).

Nutrient limitation is hypothesized as primary cause for reduced or lack of CO2 fertilisation effect observed on NPP in some experiments ({cite.6.'Luo_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Dukes_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Finzi_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Norby_et_al_2010}). Nitrogen and phosphorus are very likely to play the most important role in this limitation of the CO2 fertilisation effect on NPP, with nitrogen limitation prevalent in temperate and boreal ecosystems, and phosphorus limitation in the tropics ({cite.6.'Luo_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Vitousek_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2010a}; {cite.6.'Goll_et_al_2012}). Micronutrients interact in diverse ways with other nutrients in constraining NPP such as molybdenum and phosphorus in the tropics ({cite.6.'Wurzburger_et_al_2012}). Thus, with high confidence, the CO2 fertilisation effect will lead to enhanced NPP, but significant {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} remain on the magnitude of this effect, given the lack of experiments outside of temperate climates.
