title: 6.3.1 - Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Their Fate Since 1750

Prior to the Industrial Era, that began in 1750, the concentration of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fluctuated roughly between 180 ppm and 290 ppm for at least 2.1 Myr (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2 Section 5.2.2} and Hönisch et al., 2009; Lüthi et al., 2008; {cite.6.'Petit_et_al_1999}). Between 1750 and 2011, the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil and gas flaring) and the production of cement have released 375 ± 30 PgC (1 PgC = 1015 gC) to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} (Table 6. 1; {cite.6.'Boden_et_al_2011}). {Topics.*Land_Use_Change Land use change} activities, mainly {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation}, has released an additional 180 ± 80 PgC ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). This carbon released by {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities} is called {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} carbon.

Of the 555 ± 85 PgC of anthropogenic carbon emitted to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} from fossil fuel and cement and land use change, less than half have accumulated in the atmosphere (240 ± 10 PgC) ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). The remaining anthropogenic carbon has been absorbed by the ocean and in terrestrial ecosystems: the carbon ‘sinks’ ({'Figure_6_8 Figure 6.8}). The ocean stored 155 ± 30 PgC of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5.6_3_2_5_3 Section 6.3.2.5.3} and {Box_6_1 Box 6.1}). Terrestrial ecosystems that have not been affected by land use change since 1750, have accumulated 160 ± 90 PgC of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}), thus not fully compensating the net CO2 losses from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere from land use change during the same period estimated of 180 ± 80 PgC ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). The net balance of all terrestrial ecosystems, those affected by land use change and the others, is thus close to neutral since 1750, with an average loss of 30 ± 45 (see {'Figure_6_1 Figure 6.1}). This increased storage in terrestrial ecosystems not affected by land use change is likely to be caused by enhanced {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} at higher CO2 levels and {Glossary.*Nitrogen_deposition nitrogen deposition}, and changes in climate favouring carbon sinks such as longer growing seasons in mid-to-high latitudes. {Glossary.*Forest Forest} area expansion and increased {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} density of forests that result from changes in land use change are also carbon sinks, and they are accounted in {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1} as part of the net flux from land use change. The increased terrestrial carbon storage in ecosystems not affected by land use change is called the Residual land {Glossary.*Sink sink} in {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1} because it is inferred from mass balance as the difference between fossil and net land use change {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and measured atmospheric and oceanic storage increase.
