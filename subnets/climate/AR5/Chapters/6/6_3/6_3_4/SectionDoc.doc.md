title: 6.3.4 - Global Nitrogen Budgets and Global Nitrous Oxide Budget in the 1990s

The atmospheric abundance of {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} has been increasing mainly as a result of agricultural intensification to meet the food demand for a growing human population. Use of synthetic fertiliser (primarily from the Haber–Bosch process) and manure applications increase the production of N2O in soils and sediments, via nitrification and denitrification pathways, leading to increased N2O {Topics.*Emissions emissions} to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Increased emissions occur not only in agricultural fields, but also in aquatic systems after nitrogen leaching and {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, and in natural soils and ocean surface waters as a result of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen originating from agriculture, fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities. Food production is likely responsible for 80% of the increase in atmospheric N2O ({cite.6.'Kroeze_et_al_1999}; {cite.6.'Davidson_2009}; {cite.6.'Williams_and_Crutzen_2010}; {cite.6.'Syakila_and_Kroeze_2011}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Park_et_al_2012}), via the addition of nitrogen fertilisers. Global emissions of N2O are difficult to estimate owing to heterogeneity in space and time. {'Table_6_9 Table 6.9} presents global emissions based on upscaling of local flux measurements at the surface. Modelling of the atmospheric {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of N2O and atmospheric inversions constrain global and regional N2O budgets ({cite.6.'Hirsch_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Huang_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Rhee_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012}), although there is uncertainty in these estimates because of uncertainty in the dominant loss term of N2O, that is, the destruction of N2O by photolysis and reaction with O(1D) in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}. The long {Glossary.*Atmospheric_lifetime atmospheric lifetime} of N2O (118 to 131 years, {cite.6.'Volk_et_al_1997}; {cite.6.'Hsu_and_Prather_2010}; {cite.6.'Fleming_et_al_2011}; see {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}) implies that it will take more than a century before atmospheric abundances stabilise after the stabilization of global emissions. This is of concern not only because of its contribution to the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (see Glossary), but also because of the relative importance of N2O and other {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} in affecting the {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} layer ({cite.6.'Ravishankara_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Fleming_et_al_2011}).

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({'Table_6_9 Table 6.9} for the 1990s), a number of studies allow us to update some of the N2O emission estimates. First and most importantly, the IPCC Guidelines were revised in 2006 (De Klein et al., 2007) and in particular emission factors for estimating agricultural N2O emissions. Applying these 2006 emission factors to global agricultural statistics results in higher direct emissions from agriculture (from fertilised soils and animal production) than in AR4, but into indirect emissions (associated with leaching and runoff of Nr resulting in N2O emissions from groundwater, riparian zones and surface waters) that are considerably lower than reported in AR4 ({'Table_6_9 Table 6.9}). It should be noted that emissions of N2O show large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} when default emission factors are applied at the global scale ({cite.6.'Crutzen_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Davidson_2009}; {cite.6.'Smith_et_al_2012}). Second, estimates of the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Source source} of N2O from the open ocean have been made for the first time. These emissions result from atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Nr (nitrogen oxides and ammonia/ammonium) ({cite.6.'Duce_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Suntharalingam_et_al_2012}). This anthropogenic ocean N2O source was implicitly included as part of the natural ocean N2O source in AR4, but is now given as a separate anthropogenic source of 0.2 (0.1 to 0.4) TgN yr–1 in {'Table_6_9 Table 6.9}. Finally, a first estimate of global N2O {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} at the surface is now available ({cite.6.'Syakila_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Syakila_and_Kroeze_2011}), based on reviews of measurements of N2O uptake in soils and sediments (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2007; {cite.6.'Kroeze_et_al_2007}). The uncertainty in this {Glossary.*Sink sink} of N2O is large. On the global scale, this surface sink is negligible, but at the local scale it may not be irrelevant.
