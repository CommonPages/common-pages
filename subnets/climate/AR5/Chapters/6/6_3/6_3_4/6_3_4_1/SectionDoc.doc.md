title: 6.3.4.1 - Atmosphere Nitrous Oxide Burden and Growth Rate

The concentration of {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} is currently 20% higher than pre-industrial levels ({'Figure_6_11 Figure 6.11}; MacFarling-Meure et al., 2006). {'Figure_6_19 Figure 6.19} shows the annual growth rate of atmospheric N2O estimated from direct measurements (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Global Monitoring Division (NOAA–GMD) network of surface stations). On decadal time scales, the concentration of N2O has been increasing at a rate of 0.73 ± 0.03 ppb yr–1. The interannual variability in midto high-latitude N2O abundance in both the NH and SH was found to correlate with the strength of the stratospheric {Glossary.*Brewer_Dobson_circulation Brewer–Dobson circulation} ({cite.6.'Nevison_et_al_2011}). Variability in {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} to {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} {Glossary.*Air_mass air mass} exchange, coupled with the stratospheric N2O {Glossary.*Sink sink} is likely to be responsible for a fraction of the interannual variability in tropospheric N2O, but the understanding of this process is poor ({cite.6.'Huang_et_al_2008}). This removal process signal is obscured in the SH by the timing of oceanic thermal and biological {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation} signals ({cite.6.'Nevison_et_al_2011}) and terrestrial sources ({cite.6.'Ishijima_et_al_2009}). These two factors may thus also be important determinants of seasonal and interannual variability of N2O in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Quantitative understanding of terrestrial N2O emissions variability is poor, although emissions are known to be sensitive to soil water content ({cite.6.'Ishijima_et_al_2009}). A first process model-based estimate suggests that the mainly climate-driven variability in the terrestrial {Glossary.*Source source} may account for only 0.07 ppb yr–1 variability in atmospheric N2O growth rate, which would be difficult to detect in the observed growth rate ({cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2011}).

Most N2O is produced by biological (microbial) processes such as nitrification and denitrification in terrestrial and aquatic systems, including rivers, estuaries, coastal seas and the open ocean ({'Table_6_9 Table 6.9}; {cite.6.'Freing_et_al_2012}). In general, more N2O is formed when more reactive nitrogen is available. The production of N2O shows large spatial and temporal variability. Emission estimates for tropical regions and for aquatic systems are relatively uncertain. Inverse modelling studies show that the errors in emissions are large, especially in (sub)-tropical regions (e.g., {cite.6.'Hirsch_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Huang_et_al_2008}). {Topics.*Emissions Emissions} from rivers, estuaries and continental shelves have been the subject of debate for many years ({cite.6.'Seitzinger_and_Kroeze_1998}; De Klein et al., 2007). Recent studies confirm that rivers can be important sources of N2O, which could be a reason to reconsider recent estimates of aquatic N2O emissions ({cite.6.'Beaulieu_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Rosamond_et_al_2012}).

{'Table_6_9 Table 6.9} does not include the formation of atmospheric N2O from abiotic decomposition of ammonium nitrate in the presence of light, appropriate {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} and a surface. This process recently has been proposed as a potentially important source of N2O ({cite.6.'Rubasinghege_et_al_2011}); however, a global estimate does not yet exist. {'Table_6_9 Table 6.9} indicates that the global N2O emissions in the mid-1990s amount to 17.5 (8.1 to 30.7) TgN (N2O) yr–1. The {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range is consistent with that of atmospheric inversions studies (14.1 to 17.8) by {cite.6.'Huang_et_al_2008 Huang et al. (2008)}. The estimates of anthropogenic N2O emissions of {'Table_6_9 Table 6.9} are in line with the top-down estimates by {cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012 Prather et al. (2012)} of 6.5 ± 1.3 TgN (N2O) yr–1, and somewhat higher than their estimates for natural (9.1 ± 1.3 TgN (N2O) yr–1) and total (15.7 ± 1.1 TgN (N2O) yr–1) emissions. {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} emissions have steadily increased over the last two decades and were 6.9 (2.7 to 11.1) TgN (N2O) yr–1 in 2006, or 6% higher than the value in mid-1990s ({cite.6.'Davidson_2009}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2011}) (see also {'Figure_6_4 Figure 6.4}c). Overall, anthropogenic N2O emissions are now a factor of 8 greater than their estimated level in 1900. These trends are consistent with observed increases in atmospheric N2O ({cite.6.'Syakila_et_al_2010}). Human activities strongly influence the source of N2O, as nitrogen fertiliser used in agriculture is now the main source of nitrogen for nitrification and denitrification ({cite.6.'Opdyke_et_al_2009}). Nitrogen stable isotope ratios confirm that fertilised soils are primarily responsible for the historic increase in N2O (Röckmann and Levin, 2005; {cite.6.'Sutka_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Park_et_al_2012}).
