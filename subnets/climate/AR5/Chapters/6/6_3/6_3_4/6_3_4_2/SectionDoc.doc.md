title: 6.3.4.2 - Sensitivity of Nitrous Oxide Fluxes to Climate and Elevated Carbon Dioxide

Previous studies suggested a considerable positive {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} between {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} and climate ({cite.6.'Khalil_and_Rasmussen_1989}) supported by observed glacial–interglacial increases of ~70 ppb in atmospheric N2O (Flückiger et al., 1999). Climate change influences marine and terrestrial N2O sources, but their individual contribution and even the sign of their response to long-term climate variations are difficult to estimate (see {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2}). Simulations by terrestrial {Topics.*Climate_System biosphere} models suggest a moderate increase of global N2O {Topics.*Emissions emissions} with recent climate changes, related mainly to changes in land temperature ({cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}; Xu-Ri et al., 2012), thus suggesting a possible positive feedback to the climate system. Nonetheless, the recent change in atmospheric N2O is largely dominated to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} reactive nitrogen (Nr) and industrial emissions ({cite.6.'Holland_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Davidson_2009}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}). {cite.6.'Stocker_et_al_2013 Stocker et al. (2013)} have found, using a global coupled model of climate and biogeochemical cycles, that future climate change will amplify terrestrial N2O emissions resulting from anthropogenic Nr additions, consistent with empirical understanding (Butterbach-Bahl and Dannenmann, 2011). This result suggests that the use of constant emission factors might underestimate future N2O emission trajectories. Significant {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} remains in the N2O–{Glossary.*Climate_feedback climate feedback} from land ecosystems, given the poorly known response of emission processes to the changes in seasonal and frequency distribution of precipitation, and also because agricultural emissions themselves may also be sensitive to climate.

N2O production will be affected by climate change through the effects on the microbial nitrification and denitrification processes ({cite.6.'Barnard_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Singh_et_al_2010}; Butterbach-Bahl and Dannenmann, 2011). Warming experiments tend to show enhanced N2O emission ({cite.6.'Lohila_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Brown_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Chantarel_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Larsen_et_al_2011}). Elevated {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} predominantly increases N2O emissions(van Groenigen et al., 2011); however, reductions have also been observed ({cite.6.'Billings_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Mosier_et_al_2002}), induced by changes in {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}, plant productivity and nitrogen {Glossary.*Uptake uptake}, as well as activity and composition of soil microbial and fungal communities ({cite.6.'Barnard_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Singh_et_al_2010}). The effect of interacting climate and atmospheric CO2 change modulates and potentially dampens the individual responses to each driver ({cite.6.'Brown_et_al_2011}). A terrestrial {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} model that integrates the interacting effects of temperature, moisture and CO2 changes is capable of qualitatively reproducing the observed sensitivities to these factors and their combinations (Xu-Ri et al., 2012). Thawing {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} soils under particular hydrological settings may liberate reactive nitrogen and turn into significant sources of N2O; however, the global significance of this {Glossary.*Source source} is not established ({cite.6.'Elberling_et_al_2010}).
