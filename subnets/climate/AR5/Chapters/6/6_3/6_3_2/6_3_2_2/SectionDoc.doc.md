title: 6.3.2.2 - Net Land Use Change Carbon Dioxide Flux

{Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} is emitted to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} by land use and {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} activities, in particular deforestation, and taken up from the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} by other land uses such as {Glossary.*Afforestation afforestation} (the deliberate creation of new forests) and vegetation regrowth on abandoned lands. A critical distinction in estimating land use change is the existence of gross and net fluxes. Gross fluxes are the individual fluxes from multiple processes involved in land use change that can be either {Topics.*Emissions emissions} to or removals from the atmosphere occurring at different time scales. For example, gross emissions include instantaneous emissions from deforestation fires and long-term emissions from the decomposition of organic carbon; and they also include the long-term CO2 {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} by {Glossary.*Forest forest} regrowth and soil carbon storage on abandoned agricultural lands, afforestation and storage changes of wood products ({cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012}; Mason Earles et al., 2012). The net flux of land use change is the balance among all {Glossary.*Source source} and {Glossary.*Sink sink} processes involved in a given timeframe. The net flux of land use change is globally a net source to the atmosphere ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}; {'Figure_6_8 Figure 6.8}).

Approaches to estimate global net CO2 fluxes from land use fall into three categories: (1) the ‘bookkeeping’ method that tracks carbon in living vegetation, dead plant material, wood products and soils with cultivation, harvesting and {Glossary.*Reforestation reforestation} using country-level reports on changes in forest area and {Glossary.*Biome biome}-averaged {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} values ({cite.6.'Houghton_2003}); (2) process-based terrestrial {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} models that simulate on a grid-basis the carbon stocks (biomass, soils) and exchange fluxes between vegetation, soil and atmosphere (see references in {'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}) and (3) detailed regional (primarily tropical forests) analyses based on satellite data that estimate changes in forest area or biomass ({cite.6.'DeFries_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Achard_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Baccini_et_al_2012}; {cite.6.'Harris_et_al_2012}). Satellite-derived estimates of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from so-called deforestation fires (van der Werf et al., 2010) provide additional constraints on the spatial {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} and variability of land use change gross emissions. Most global estimates do not include emissions from peat burning or decomposition after a land use change, which are estimated to be 0.12 PgC yr–1 over 1997–2006 for peat fires (van der Werf et al., 2008) and between 0.10 and 0.23 PgC yr–1 from the decomposition of drained peat ({cite.6.'Hooijer_et_al_2010}). The processes and time scales captured by these methods to estimate net land use change CO2 emissions are diverse, creating difficulties with comparison of different estimates ({cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012}; {'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}). The bookkeeping method of {cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012 Houghton et al. (2012)} was used for {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1} because it is closest to observations and includes the most extensive set of management practices ({'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}). Methods that do not include long-term ‘legacy’ fluxes from soils caused by deforestation ({'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}) underestimate net land use change CO2 emissions by 13 to 62% depending on the starting year and decade ({cite.6.'Ramankutty_et_al_2006}), and methods that do not include the fate of carbon wood harvest and shifting cultivation underestimate CO2 emissions by 25 to 35% ({cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012}).

{table:'Table_6_2}

Global net CO2 emissions from land use change are estimated at 1.4, 1.5 and 1.1 PgC yr–1 for the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively, by the bookkeeping method of {cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012 Houghton et al. (2012)} ({'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}; {'Figure_6_10 Figure 6.10}). This estimate is consistent with global emissions simulated by process-based terrestrial ecosystem models using mainly three land cover change data products as input for time-varying maps of land use change ({'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}). The bookkeeping method estimate is also generally consistent although higher than the satellite-based methods (tropics only). Part of the discrepancy can be accounted for by emissions from extratropical regions (~0.1 PgC yr–1; {'Table_6_3 Table 6.3}) and by legacy fluxes for land cover change prior to 1980s (~0.2 PgC yr–1) that are not covered by satellite-based methods used in {'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}, and by the fact that the bookkeeping method accounts for degradation and shifting agriculture CO2 losses not detected in the satellite-based method reported in {'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}. We adopt an {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of ±0.8 PgC yr–1 as representative of 90% uncertainty intervals. This is identical to the uncertainty of ±0.5 PgC yr–1 representing ±1-σ interval (68% if Gaussian distributed error) from {cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012 Houghton et al. (2012)}. This uncertainty of ±0.8 PgC yr–1 on net land use change CO2 fluxes is smaller than the one that was reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} of 0.5 to 2.7 PgC yr–1 for the 1990s (68% confidence interval). In this chapter, uncertainty is estimated based on expert judgment of the available evidence, including improved accuracy of land cover change incorporating satellite data, the larger number of independent methods to quantify emissions and the consistency of the reported results ({'Table_6_2 Table 6.2}; {'Figure_6_10 Figure 6.10}).

Different estimates of net land use change CO2 emissions are shown in {'Figure_6_10 Figure 6.10}. The lower net land use change CO2 emissions reported in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, by 0.5 PgC yr–1 in the bookkeeping method based on {cite.6.'FAO_2010 FAO (2010)}, and by 0.3 to 0.5 PgC yr–1 from five process-based ecosystem models based on the HistorY Database of the global Environment (HYDE) land cover change data updated to 2009 ({cite.6.'Goldewijk_et_al_2011}), are within the error bar of the data and methods. The bookkeeping method suggests that most of the LUC emissions originate from Central and South America, Africa and Tropical Asia since the 1980s ({'Table_6_3 Table 6.3}). The process models based on the HYDE database allocate about 30% of the global land use change emissions to East Asia, but this is difficult to reconcile with the large afforestation programmes reported in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}. Inconsistencies in the available land cover change reconstructions and in the modelling results prevent a firm assessment of recent trends and their partitioning among regions (see regional data in {'Table_6_3 Table 6.3}).

In this chapter, we do not assess individual gross fluxes that sum up to make the net land use change CO2 emission, because there are too few independent studies. Gross emissions from tropical deforestation and degradation were 3.0 ± 0.5 PgC yr–1 for the 1990s and 2.8 ± 0.5 PgC yr–1 for the 2000s using forest inventory data, {cite.6.'FAO_2010 FAO (2010)} and the bookeeping method ({cite.6.'Pan_et_al_2011}). These gross emissions are about double the net emissions because of the presence of a large regrowth that compensates for about half of the gross emissions. A recent analysis estimated a lower gross deforestation of 0.6 to 1.2 PgC yr–1 ({cite.6.'Harris_et_al_2012}). That study primarily estimated permanent deforestation and excluded additional gross emissions from degraded forests, shifting agriculture and some carbon pools. In fact, gross emissions from permanent deforestation are in agreement between the bookkeeping method of {cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012 Houghton et al. (2012)} and the satellite data analysis of {cite.6.'Harris_et_al_2012 Harris et al. (2012)}.

Over the 1750–2011 period, cumulative net CO2 emissions from land use change of 180 ± 80 PgC are estimated ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). The uncertainty is based on the spread of the available estimates ({'Figure_6_10 Figure 6.10}). The cumulative net CO2 emissions from land use change have been dominated by deforestation and other land use change in the mid-northern latitudes prior to 1980s, and in the tropics since the 1980s, largely from deforestation in tropical America and Asia with smaller contributions from tropical Africa. {Glossary.*Deforestation Deforestation} from 800 to 1750 has been estimated at 27 PgC using a process-based ecosystem model ({cite.6.'Pongratz_et_al_2009}).
