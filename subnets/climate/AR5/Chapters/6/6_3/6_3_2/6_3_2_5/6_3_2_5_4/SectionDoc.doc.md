title: 6.3.2.5.4 - Regional ocean carbon dioxide partial pressure trends

Observations of the partial pressure of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} at the ocean surface (pCO2) show that ocean pCO2 has been increasing generally at about the same rate as CO2 in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} when averaged over large ocean regions during the past two to three decades (Yoshikawa-Inoue and Ishii, 2005; {cite.6.'Takahashi_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'McKinley_et_al_2011}). However, analyses of regional observations highlight substantial regional and temporal variations around the mean {Glossary.*Trend trend}.

In the North Atlantic, repeated observations show ocean pCO2 increasing regionally either at the same rate or faster than atmospheric CO2 between about 1990 and 2006 ({cite.6.'Schuster_et_al_2009}), thus indicating a constant or decreasing {Glossary.*Sink sink} for CO2 in that {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, in contrast to the increasing sink expected from the response of the ocean to increasing atmospheric CO2 alone. The anomalous North Atlantic trends appear to be related to sea surface warming and its effect on solubility (Corbière et al., 2007) and/or changes in ocean circulation ({cite.6.'Schuster_and_Watson_2007}; {cite.6.'Schuster_et_al_2009}) and deep {Glossary.*Convection convection} ({cite.6.'Metzl_et_al_2010}). Recent changes have been associated with decadal variability in the North Atlantic Oscillation ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMV}) ({cite.6.'Thomas_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Ullman_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'McKinley_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Tjiputra_et_al_2012}). A systematic analysis of trends estimated in this region show no agreement regarding the drivers of change ({cite.6.'Schuster_et_al_2013}).

In the Southern Ocean, an approximately constant sink was inferred from atmospheric (Le Quéré et al., 2007) and oceanic ({cite.6.'Metzl_2009}; {cite.6.'Takahashi_et_al_2009}) CO2 observations but the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are large ({cite.6.'Law_et_al_2008}). Most ocean biogeochemistry models reproduce the constant sink and attribute it as a response to an increase in Southern Ocean winds driving increased upwards transport of carbon-rich deep waters ({cite.6.'Lenton_and_Matear_2007}; {cite.6.'Verdy_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Lovenduski_et_al_2008}; Le Quéré et al., 2010). The increase in winds has been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the depletion of stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({cite.6.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2002}) with a contribution from {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} ({cite.6.'Fyfe_and_Saenko_2006}).

Large decadal variability has been observed in the Equatorial Pacific ({cite.6.'Ishii_et_al_2009}) associated with changes in the phasing of the {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation Pacific Decadal Oscillation} (see Glossary) and its impact on gas transfer velocity ({cite.6.'Feely_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Valsala_et_al_2012}). By contrast, ocean pCO2 appears to have increased at a slower rate than atmospheric CO2 (thus a growing ocean CO2 sink in that region) in the northern North Pacific Ocean ({cite.6.'Takahashi_et_al_2006}). There is less evidence available to attribute the observed changes in other regions to changes in underlying processes or climate change and variability.
