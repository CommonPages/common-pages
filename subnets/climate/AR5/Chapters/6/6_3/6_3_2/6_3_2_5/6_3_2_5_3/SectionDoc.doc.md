title: 6.3.2.5.3 - Interannual variability in air-sea CO2 fluxes

The interannual variability in the global ocean {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Glossary.*Sink sink} is estimated to be of about ±0.2 PgC yr–1 ({cite.6.'Wanninkhof_et_al_2013}) which is small compared to the interannual variability of the terrestrial CO2 sink (see Sections {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_3 6.3.2.3} and {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6.6_3_2_6_3 6.3.2.6.3}; {'Figure_6_12 Figure 6.12}). In general, the ocean takes up more CO2 during El Niño episodes ({cite.6.'Park_et_al_2010}) because of the temporary suppression of the {Glossary.*Source source} of CO2 to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} over the eastern Pacific upwelling. Interannual variability of ~0.3 PgC yr–1 has been reported for the North Atlantic ocean {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} alone ({cite.6.'Watson_et_al_2009}) but there is no agreement among estimates regarding the exact magnitude of driving factors of air–sea CO2 flux variability in this region ({cite.6.'Schuster_et_al_2013}). Interannual variability of 0.1 to 0.2 PgC yr–1 was also estimated by models and one atmospheric inversion in the Southern Ocean (Le Quéré et al., 2007), possibly driven by the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode Southern Annular Mode} of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({cite.6.'Lenton_and_Matear_2007}; {cite.6.'Lovenduski_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Lourantou_and_Metzl_2011}).
