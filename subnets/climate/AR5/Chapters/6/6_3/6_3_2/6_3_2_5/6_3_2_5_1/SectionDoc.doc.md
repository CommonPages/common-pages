title: 6.3.2.5.1 - Global ocean sink and decadal change

The estimated mean {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} ocean {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Glossary.*Sink sink} assessed in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} was 2.2 ± 0.7 PgC yr–1 for the 1990s based on observations ({cite.6.'McNeil_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Manning_and_Keeling_2006}; Mikaloff-Fletcher et al., 2006), and is supported by several contemporary estimates (see {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}). Note that the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of ±0.7 PgC yr–1 reported here (90% confidence interval) is the same as the ±0.4 PgC yr–1 uncertainty reported in AR4 (68% confidence intervals). The {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean is primarily a response to increasing CO2 in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and is limited mainly by the rate at which anthropogenic CO2 is transported from the surface waters into the deep ocean ({cite.6.'Sarmiento_et_al_1992}; {cite.6.'Graven_et_al_2012}). This anthropogenic ocean CO2 sink occurs on top of a very active natural oceanic {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. Recent climate trends, such as ocean warming, changes in ocean circulation and changes in marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, can have affected both the anthropogenic ocean CO2 sink as well as the natural air–sea CO2 fluxes. We report a decadal mean uptake of 2.0 ± 0.7 PgC yr–1 for the 1980s and of 2.3 ± 0.7 PgC yr–1 for the 2000s ({'Table_6_4 Table 6.4}). The methods used are: (1) an empirical Green’s function approach fitted to observations of transient ocean tracers ({cite.6.'Khatiwala_et_al_2009}), (2) a model-based Green’s function approach fitted to anthropogenic carbon reconstructions (Mikaloff-Fletcher et al., 2006), (3) estimates based on empirical relationships between observed ocean surface pCO2 and temperature and salinity ({cite.6.'Park_et_al_2010}) and (4) process-based global ocean biogeochemical models forced by observed meteorological fields ({cite.6.'Doney_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Assmann_et_al_2010}; Le Quéré et al., 2010; {cite.6.'Graven_et_al_2012}). All these different methods suggest that in the absence of recent climate change and {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, the ocean anthropogenic CO2 sink should have increased by 0.23 ± 0.15 PgC yr–1 between the 1980s and the 1990s, and by 0.33 ± 0.13 PgC yr–1 between the 1990s and the 2000s ({'Figure_6_14 Figure 6.14}). The decadal estimates in the ocean CO2 sink reported in {'Table_6_4 Table 6.4} as ‘CO2 effects only’ are entirely explained by the faster rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 in the later decade. On the other hand, ‘climate effects only’ in {'Table_6_4 Table 6.4} are assessed to have no noticeable effect on the sink difference between the 1980s and the 1990s (0.02 ± 0.05 PgC yr–1), but are estimated to have reduced the ocean anthropogenic CO2 sink by 0.19 ± 0.18 PgC yr–1 between the 1990s and the 2000s ({'Table_6_4 Table 6.4}).
