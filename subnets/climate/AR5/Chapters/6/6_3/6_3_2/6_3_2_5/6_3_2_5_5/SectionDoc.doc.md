title: 6.3.2.5.5 - Processes driving variability and trends in air–sea carbon dioxide fluxes

Three type of processes are estimated to have an important effect on the air–sea {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fluxes on century time scales: (1) the dissolution of CO2 at the ocean surface and its chemical equilibrium with other forms of carbon in the ocean (mainly carbonate and bicarbonate), (2) the transport of carbon between the surface and the intermediate and deep ocean and (3) changes in the cycling of carbon through marine {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} processes (the ocean {Glossary.*Biological_pump biological pump}; see {Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_1.6_1_1_1 Section 6.1.1.1}). The surface dissolution and equilibration of CO2 with the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is well understood and quantified. It varies with the surface ocean conditions, in particular with temperature (solubility effect) and {Glossary.*Alkalinity alkalinity}. The capacity of the ocean to take up additional CO2 for a given alkalinity decreases at higher temperature (4.23% per degree warming; {cite.6.'Takahashi_et_al_1993}) and at elevated CO2 concentrations (about 15% per 100 ppm, computed from the so called Revelle factor; {cite.6.'Revelle_and_Suess_1957}).

Recent changes in nutrient supply in the ocean are also thought to have changed the export of organic carbon from biological processes below the {Glossary.*Surface_layer surface layer}, and thus the ocean CO2 {Glossary.*Sink sink} ({cite.6.'Duce_et_al_2008}). {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} reactive nitrogen Nr (see {Box_6_2 Box 6.2}) entering the ocean via atmospheric deposition or rivers acts as a fertiliser and may enhance carbon export to depth and hence the CO2 sink. This Nr contribution has been estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.4 PgC yr–1 around the year 2000 using models ({cite.6.'Duce_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Reay_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Krishnamurthy_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Suntharalingam_et_al_2012}). Similarly, increases in iron deposition over the ocean from dust generated by human activity is estimated to have enhanced the ocean cumulative CO2 {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} by 8 PgC during the 20th century (or about 0.05 PgC yr–1 in the past decades) ({cite.6.'Mahowald_et_al_2010}). Although changes in ocean circulation and in global biogeochemical drivers have the potential to alter the ocean carbon fluxes through changes in marine ecosystems, modelling studies show only small variability in ocean biological pump, which has not significantly impacted the response of the ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} over the recent period ({cite.6.'Bennington_et_al_2009}).

Model studies suggest that the response of the air–sea CO2 fluxes to climate change and variability in recent decades has decreased the rate at which anthropogenic CO2 is absorbed by the ocean ({cite.6.'Sarmiento_et_al_2010 Sarmiento et al. (2010)}; {'Figure_6_14 Figure 6.14} and {'Table_6_4 Table 6.4}). This result is robust to the model or climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} used ({'Figure_6_13 Figure 6.13}), but no formal {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} to anthropogenic climate change has been made. There is insufficient data coverage to separate the impact of climate change on the global ocean CO2 sink directly from observations, though the regional trends described in {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5.6_3_2_5_4 Section 6.3.2.5.4} suggest that surface ocean pCO2 responds to changes in ocean properties in a significant and measurable way.
