title: 6.3.2.5.2 - Regional changes in ocean dissolved inorganic carbon

Observational-based estimates for the global ocean inventory of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} carbon are obtained from shipboard repeated hydrographic cross sections ({cite.6.'Sabine_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Waugh_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Khatiwala_et_al_2009}). These estimates agree well among each other, with an average value of 155 ± 30 PgC of increased dissolved inorganic carbon for the period 1750–2011 (see {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}). The {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of anthropogenic carbon into the ocean is observed to be larger in the high latitudes than in the tropics and subtropics over the entire Industrial Era, because of the more vigorous ocean {Glossary.*Convection convection} in the high latitudes ({cite.6.'Khatiwala_et_al_2009}). A number of ocean cross sections have been repeated over the last decade, and the observed changes in carbon storage ({'Table_6_5 Table 6.5}) suggest that some locations have rates of carbon {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} that are higher and others that are lower than the global average estimated by {cite.6.'Khatiwala_et_al_2009 Khatiwala et al. (2009)}. Model results suggest that there may be an effect of climate change and variability in the storage of total inorganic carbon in the ocean ({'Table_6_4 Table 6.4}), but that this effect is small (~2 PgC over the past 50 years; {'Figure_6_14 Figure 6.14}) compared to the cumulative uptake of anthropogenic carbon during the same period.
