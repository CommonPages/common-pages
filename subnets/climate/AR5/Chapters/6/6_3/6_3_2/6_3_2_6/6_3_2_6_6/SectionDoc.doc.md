title: 6.3.2.6.6 - Model evaluation of global and regional terrestrial carbon balance

Evaluation of global process-based land carbon models was performed against ground and satellite observations including (1) measured {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fluxes and carbon storage change at particular sites around the world, in particular sites from the Fluxnet global network ({cite.6.'Baldocchi_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Jung_et_al_2007}; Stöckli et al., 2008; {cite.6.'Schwalm_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Tan_et_al_2010}), (2) observed spatio-temporal change in leaf area index (LAI) ({cite.6.'Lucht_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2006}) and (3) interannual and seasonal change in atmospheric CO2 ({cite.6.'Randerson_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Cadule_et_al_2010}).

{'Figure_6_16 Figure 6.16} compares the global land CO2 {Glossary.*Sink sink} driven by climate change and rising CO2 as simulated by different process based {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} models (without {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}), with the residual land sink computed as the sum of fossil fuel and cement {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and land use change emissions minus the sum of CO2 growth rate and ocean sink (Le Quéré et al., 2009; {cite.6.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2010}). Although these two quantities are not the same, the multi-model mean reproduces well the {Glossary.*Trend trend} and interannual variability of the residual land sink which is dominated by {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} and climate trends and CO2, respectively, both represented in models ({'Table_6_7 Table 6.7}). Limited availability of in situ measurements, particularly in the tropics, limits the progress towards reducing {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} on model parameterizations.

Regional and local measurements can be used to evaluate and improve global models. Regionally, {Glossary.*Forest forest} inventory data show that the forest carbon sink density over Europe is of –89 ± 19 gC m–2 yr–1, which is compatible with model estimates with {Glossary.*Afforestation afforestation} (–63 gC m–2 yr–1; {cite.6.'Luyssaert_et_al_2010}), while modelled NPP was 43% larger than the inventory estimate. In North America, the ability of 22 terrestrial carbon cycle models to simulate the seasonal cycle of land–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} CO2 exchange from 44 eddy covariance flux towers was poor with a difference between observations and simulations of 10 times the observational uncertainty ({cite.6.'Schwalm_et_al_2010}). Model shortcomings included spring phenology, soil thaw, snow pack melting and lag responses to {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme climate events} ({cite.6.'Keenan_et_al_2012}). In China, the magnitude of the carbon sink estimated by five terrestrial {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} models (–0.22 to –0.13 PgC yr–1) was comparable to the observation-based estimate (–0.18 ± 0.73 PgC yr–1; {cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2009a}), but modelled interannual variation was weakly correlated to observed regional land–{Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} CO2 fluxes ({cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2011}).

Sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon cycle to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. An inter-comparison of 10 process-based models showed increased NPP by 3% to 10% over the last three decades, during which CO2 increased by ~50 ppm ({cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2013}). These results are consistent within the broad range of responses from experimental studies (see {Box_6_3 Box 6.3}). However, {cite.6.'Hickler_et_al_2008 Hickler et al. (2008)} suggested that currently available FACE results (largely from temperate regions) are not applicable to vegetation globally because there may be large spatial heterogeneity in vegetation responses to CO2 fertilisation.

Sensitivity of terrestrial carbon cycle to climate trends and variability.

Warming exerts a direct control on the net land–atmosphere CO2 exchange because both {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} and {Glossary.*Respiration respiration} are sensitive to changes in temperature. From estimates of interannual variations in the residual land sink, 1°C of positive global temperature anomaly leads to a decrease of 4 PgC yr–1 of the global land CO2 sink ({'Figure_6_17 Figure 6.17}). This observed interannual response is close to the response of the models listed in {'Table_6_7 Table 6.7} (–3.5 ± 1.5 PgC yr–1°C–1 in {cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2013}), albeit individual models show a range going from –0.5 to –6.2 PgC yr–1 °C–1. The sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 concentration to century scale temperature change was estimated at about 3.6 to 45.6 PgC °C–1 (or 1.7 to 21.4 ppm CO2 °C–1) using the {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} observed CO2 drop during the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age Little Ice Age} (see {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2}; {cite.6.'Frank_et_al_2010}).

Terrestrial carbon cycle models used in AR5 generally underestimate {Glossary.*Gross_Primary_Production GPP} in the water limited regions, implying that these models do not correctly simulate {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} conditions, or that they are too sensitive to changes in soil moisture ({cite.6.'Jung_et_al_2007}). Most models ({'Table_6_7 Table 6.7}) estimated that the interannual precipitation sensitivity of the global land CO2 sink to be higher than that of the observed residual land sink (–0.01 PgC yr–1 mm–1; {'Figure_6_17 Figure 6.17}).

Processes missing in terrestrial carbon cycle models. First, many models do not explicitly take into account the various forms of disturbances or ecosystem dynamics: migration, fire, logging, harvesting, insect outbreaks and the resulting variation in forest age structure which is known to affect the net carbon exchange (Kurz et al., 2008c; {cite.6.'Bellassen_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Higgins_and_Harte_2012}). Second, many key processes relevant to decomposition of carbon are missing in models (Todd-Brown et al., 2012), and particularly for {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} carbon and for carbon in boreal and tropical wetlands and peatlands, despite the large amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems and their vulnerability to warming and land use change ({cite.6.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Hooijer_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Page_et_al_2011}). However, progress has been made ({cite.6.'Wania_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Koven_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Schaefer_et_al_2011}). Third, nutrient dynamics are taken into account only by few models despite the fact it is well established that nutrient constrains NPP and {Glossary.*Nitrogen_deposition nitrogen deposition} enhances NPP ({cite.6.'Elser_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Magnani_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'LeBauer_and_Treseder_2008}); see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6.6_3_2_6_5 Section 6.3.2.6.5}. Very few models have phosphorus dynamics ({cite.6.'Zhang_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Goll_et_al_2012}). Fourth, the negative effects of elevated tropospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} on NPP have not been taken into account by most current carbon cycle models ({cite.6.'Sitch_et_al_2007}). Fifth, transfer of radiation, water and heat in the vegetation–soil–atmosphere continuum are treated very simply in the global ecosystem models. Finally, processes that transport carbon at the surface (e.g., water and tillage erosion; {cite.6.'Quinton_et_al_2010}) and human managements including fertilisation and irrigation ({cite.6.'Gervois_et_al_2008}) are poorly or not represented at all. Broadly, models are still at their early stages in dealing with land use, land use change and forestry.
