title: 6.3.2.6.4 - Carbon fluxes from inland water

Global analyses estimate that inland waters receive about 1.7 to 2.7 PgC yr–1 emitted by soils to rivers headstreams, of which, 0.2 to 0.6 PgC yr–1 is buried in aquatic sediments, 0.8 to 1.2 PgC yr–1 returns to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} as {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, and 0.9 PgC yr–1 is delivered to the ocean ({cite.6.'Cole_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Battin_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Aufdenkampe_et_al_2011}). Estimates of the transport of carbon from land ecosystems to the coastal ocean by rivers are ~0.2 PgC yr–1 for Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), 0.3 PgC yr–1 for Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), and 0.1 to 0.4 PgC yr–1 for Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) ({cite.6.'Seitzinger_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Syvitski_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Mayorga_et_al_2010}). For the DIC fluxes, only about twothirds of it originates from atmospheric CO2 and the rest of the carbon is supplied by weathered carbonate rocks ({cite.6.'Suchet_and_Probst_1995}; {cite.6.'Gaillardet_et_al_1999}; {cite.6.'Oh_and_Raymond_2006}; {cite.6.'Hartmann_et_al_2009}).

Regional DIC concentrations in rivers has increased during the Industrial Era ({cite.6.'Oh_and_Raymond_2006}; {cite.6.'Hamilton_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Perrin_et_al_2008}). Agricultural practices coupled with climate change can lead to large increases in regional scale DIC export in watersheds with a large agricultural footprint ({cite.6.'Raymond_et_al_2008}). Furthermore, regional urbanization also elevates DIC fluxes in rivers ({cite.6.'Baker_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Barnes_and_Raymond_2009}), which suggests that {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} activities have contributed a significant portion of the annual global river DIC flux to the ocean.

Land clearing and management are thought to produce an acceleration of POC transport, much of which is trapped in alluvial and colluvial deposition zones, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands ({cite.6.'Stallard_1998}; {cite.6.'Smith_et_al_2001b}; {cite.6.'Syvitski_et_al_2005}). Numerous studies have demonstrated an increase in the concentration of DOC in rivers in the northeastern United States and northern/central Europe over the past two to four decades ({cite.6.'Worrall_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Evans_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Findlay_2005}; {cite.6.'Monteith_et_al_2007}; Lepistö et al., 2008). Owing to the important role of wetlands in DOC production, the mobilization of DOC due to human-induced changes in wetlands probably represents an important cause of changes in global river DOC fluxes to date ({cite.6.'Seitzinger_et_al_2005}), although a global estimate of this alteration is not available. A robust partitioning between natural and anthropogenic carbon fluxes in freshwater systems is not yet possible, nor a quantification of the ultimate fate of carbon delivered by rivers to the coastal and open oceans.
