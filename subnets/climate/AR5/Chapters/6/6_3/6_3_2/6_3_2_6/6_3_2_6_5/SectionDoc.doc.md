title: 6.3.2.6.5 - Processes driving terrestrial atmosphere-to-land carbon dioxide fluxes

Assessment of experimental data, observations and model results suggests that the main processes responsible for the residual land {Glossary.*Sink sink} include the {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fertilisation effect on {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} (see {Box_6_3 Box 6.3}), nitrogen fertilisation by increased deposition ({cite.6.'Norby_1998}; {cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Bonan_and_Levis_2010}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}) and climate effects ({cite.6.'Nemani_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Gloor_et_al_2009}). It is likely that reactive {Glossary.*Nitrogen_deposition nitrogen deposition} over land currently increases natural CO2 in particular in forests, but the magnitude of this effect varies between regions ({cite.6.'Norby_1998}; {cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Bonan_and_Levis_2010}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}). Processes responsible for the net {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}-to-land CO2 sink on terrestrial ecosystems include, in addition, {Glossary.*Forest forest} regrowth and {Glossary.*Afforestation afforestation} ({cite.6.'Myneni_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Pacala_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Houghton_2010}; {cite.6.'Bellassen_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Williams_et_al_2012a}), changes in forest management and reduced harvest rates ({cite.6.'Nabuurs_et_al_2008}).

Process {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution attribution} of the global land CO2 sink is difficult due to limited availability of global data sets and biogeochemical models that include all major processes. However, regional studies shed light on key drivers and their interactions. The European and North American carbon sinks are explained by the combination of forest regrowth in abandoned lands and decreased forest harvest along with the fertilisation effects of rising CO2 and nitrogen deposition ({cite.6.'Pacala_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Ciais_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Sutton_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Schulze_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Bellassen_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Williams_et_al_2012a}). In the tropics, there is evidence from forest inventories that increasing forest growth rates are not explained by the natural recovery from disturbances, suggesting that increasing atmospheric CO2 and climate change play a role in the observed sink in established forests ({cite.6.'Lewis_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Pan_et_al_2011}). There is also recent evidence of tropical nitrogen deposition becoming more notable although its effects on the net carbon balance have not been assessed ({cite.6.'Hietz_et_al_2011}).

The land {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} is very sensitive to climate changes (e.g., precipitation, temperature, diffuse vs. direct radiation), and thus the changes in the physical climate from increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} as well as in the diffuse fraction of sunlight are likely to be causing significant changes in the carbon cycle ({cite.6.'Jones_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Mercado_et_al_2009}). Changes in the climate are also associated with disturbances such as fires, insect damage, storms, droughts and heat waves which are already significant processes of interannual variability and possibly trends of regional land carbon fluxes ({cite.6.'Page_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Ciais_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Chambers_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Kurz_et_al_2008b}; {cite.6.'Clark_et_al_2010}; van der Werf et al., 2010; {cite.6.'Lewis_et_al_2011}) (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_2 Section 6.3.2.2}).

Warming (and possibly the CO2 fertilisation effect) has also been correlated with global trends in satellite greenness observations, which resulted in an estimated 6% increase of global NPP, or the {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} of 3.4 PgC on land over the period 1982–1999 ({cite.6.'Nemani_et_al_2003}). This enhanced NPP was {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the relaxation of climatic constraints to plant growth, particularly in high latitudes. Concomitant to the increased of NPP with warming, global soil {Glossary.*Respiration respiration} also increased between 1989 and 2008 (Bond-Lamberty and Thomson, 2010), reducing the magnitude of the net land sink. A recent study suggests a declining NPP {Glossary.*Trend trend} over 2000–2009 ({cite.6.'Zhao_and_Running_2010}) although the model used to reconstruct NPP trends from satellite observation has not been widely accepted ({cite.6.'Medlyn_2011}; {cite.6.'Samanta_et_al_2011}).
