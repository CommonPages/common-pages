title: 6.3.2.6.1 - Global residual land sink and atmosphere-to-land carbon dioxide flux

The residual land {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Glossary.*Sink sink}, that is, the {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of CO2 in ecosystems excluding the effects of {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}, is 1.5 ± 1.1, 2.6 ± 1.2 and 2.6 ± 1.2 PgC yr–1 for the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). After including the net land use change {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, the atmosphereto-land flux of CO2 ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}) corresponds to a net sink of CO2 by all terrestrial ecosystems. This sink has intensified globally from a neutral CO2 flux of 0.1 ± 0.8 PgC yr–1 in the 1980s to a net CO2 sink of 1.1 ± 0.9 PgC yr–1 and 1.5 ± 0.9 PgC yr–1 during the 1990s and 2000s, respectively ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}; {cite.6.'Sarmiento_et_al_2010}). This growing land sink is also supported by an atmospheric inversion ({cite.6.'Gurney_and_Eckels_2011}) and by process-based models (Le Quéré et al., 2009).
