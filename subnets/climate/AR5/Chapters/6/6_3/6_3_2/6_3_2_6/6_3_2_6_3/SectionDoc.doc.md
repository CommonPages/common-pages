title: 6.3.2.6.3 - Interannual variability in atmosphere-to-land carbon dioxide fluxes

The interannual variability of the residual land {Glossary.*Sink sink} shown in Figures {'Figure_6_12 6.12} and {'Figure_6_16 6.16} accounts for most of the interannual variability of the atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} growth rate (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_3 Section 6.3.2.3}). Atmospheric CO2 inversion results suggest that tropical land ecosystems dominate the global CO2 variability, with positive anomalies during El Niño episodes ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2000}; Rödenbeck et al., 2003; {cite.6.'Baker_et_al_2006}), which is consistent with the results of one inversion of atmospheric {Glossary.*13C 13C} and CO2 measurements ({cite.6.'Rayner_et_al_2008}). A combined El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO})–Volcanic index time series explains 75% of the observed variability ({cite.6.'Raupach_et_al_2008}). A positive phase of ENSO (El Niño, see Glossary) is generally associated with enhanced land CO2 {Glossary.*Source source}, and a negative phase ({Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña}) with enhanced land CO2 sink ({cite.6.'Jones_and_Cox_2001}; {cite.6.'Peylin_et_al_2005}). Observations from eddy covariance networks suggest that interannual carbon flux variability in the tropics and temperate regions is dominated by precipitation, while boreal {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} fluxes are more sensitive to temperature and {Glossary.*Shortwave_radiation shortwave radiation} variation ({cite.6.'Jung_et_al_2011}), in agreement with the results from process-based terrestrial ecosystem models ({cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2009a}). Terrestrial biogeochemical models suggest that interannual net {Glossary.*Biome biome} productivity (NBP) variability is dominated by {Glossary.*Gross_Primary_Production GPP} (see Glossary) rather than terrestrial ecosystem {Glossary.*Respiration respiration} ({cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2009b}; {cite.6.'Jung_et_al_2011}).
