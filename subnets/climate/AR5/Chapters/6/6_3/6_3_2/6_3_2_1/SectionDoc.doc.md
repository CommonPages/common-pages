title: 6.3.2.1 - Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil Fuel Combustion and Cement Production

Global {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from the combustion of fossil fuels used for this chapter are determined from national energy consumption statistics and converted to emissions by fuel type ({cite.6.'Marland_and_Rotty_1984}). Estimated {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} for the annual global emissions are on the order of ±8% (converted from ±10% uncertainty for 95% confidence intervals in {cite.6.'Andres_et_al_2012 Andres et al. (2012)} to the 90% confidence intervals used here). The uncertainty has been increasing in recent decades because a larger fraction of the global emissions originate from emerging economies where energy statistics and emission factors per fuel type are more uncertain ({cite.6.'Gregg_et_al_2008}). CO2 emissions from cement production were 4% of the total emissions during 2000–2009, compared to 3% in the 1990s ({cite.6.'Boden_et_al_2011}). Additional emissions from gas flaring represent <1% of the global emissions.

Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production were 7.8 ± 0.6 PgC yr–1 on average during 2000–2009, 6.4 ± 0.5 PgC yr–1 during 1990–1999 and 5.5 ± 0.4 PgC yr–1 during 1980–1989 ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}; {'Figure_6_8 Figure 6.8}). Global fossil fuel CO2 emissions increased by 3.2% yr–1 on average during the decade 2000–2009 compared to 1.0% yr–1 in the 1990s and 1.9% yr–1 in the 1980s. {cite.6.'Francey_et_al_2013 Francey et al. (2013)} recently suggested a cumulative underestimation of 8.8 PgC emissions during the period 1993–2004, which would reduce the contrast in emissions growth rates between the two decades. The global financial crisis in 2008–2009 induced only a short-lived drop in global emissions in 2009 (–0.3%), with the return to high annual growth rates of 5.1% and 3.0% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, and fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions of 9.2 ± 0.8 PgC in 2010 and 9.5 ± 0.8 PgC in 2011 ({cite.6.'Peters_et_al_2013}).
