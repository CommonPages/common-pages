title: 6.3.2.3 - Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentration Growth Rate

Since the beginning of the Industrial Era (1750), the concentration of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} has increased by 40%, from 278 ± 5 ppm to 390.5 ± 0.1 ppm in 2011 ({'Figure_6_11 Figure 6.11}; updated from {cite.6.'Ballantyne_et_al_2012 Ballantyne et al. (2012)}, corresponding to an increase in CO2 of 240 ± 10 PgC in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}. Atmospheric CO2 grew at a rate of 3.4 ± 0.2 PgC yr–1 in the 1980s, 3.1 ± 0.2 PgC yr–1 in the 1990s and 4.0 ± 0.2 PgC yr–1 in the 2000s ({cite.6.'Conway_and_Tans_2011}) ({'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}). The increase of atmospheric CO2 between 1750 and 1957, prior to direct measurements in the atmosphere, is established from measurements of CO2 trapped in air bubbles in ice cores (e.g., {cite.6.'Etheridge_et_al_1996}). After 1957, the increase of atmospheric CO2 is established from highly precise continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements at background stations (e.g., {cite.6.'Keeling_et_al_1976}).

The {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} record of atmospheric CO2 during the past century exhibits interesting variations, which can be related to climate induced-changes in the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. Most conspicuous is the interval from about 1940 to 1955, during which atmospheric CO2 concentration stabilised ({cite.6.'Trudinger_et_al_2002}), and the {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} growth slowed down (MacFarling-Meure et al., 2006), possibly caused by slightly decreasing temperatures over land in the NH ({cite.6.'Rafelski_et_al_2009}).

There is substantial evidence, for example, from {Glossary.*13C 13C} carbon {Glossary.*Isotopes isotopes} in atmospheric CO2 ({cite.6.'Keeling_et_al_2005}) that {Glossary.*Source source}/{Glossary.*Sink sink} processes on land generate most of the interannual variability in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate ({'Figure_6_12 Figure 6.12}). The strong positive anomalies of the CO2 growth rate in El Niño years (e.g., 1986–1987 and 1997–1998) originated in tropical latitudes (see Sections 6.3.6.3 and 6.3.2.5.4), while the anomalies in 2003 and 2005 originated in northern mid-latitudes, perhaps reflecting the European {Glossary.*Heat_wave heat wave} in 2003 ({cite.6.'Ciais_et_al_2005}). Volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} also contributes to multi-annual variability in carbon storage on land and in the ocean ({cite.6.'Jones_and_Cox_2001}; {cite.6.'Gerber_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Brovkin_et_al_2010}; Frölicher et al., 2011).

With a very high confidence, the increase in CO2 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from fossil fuel burning and those arising from {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} are the dominant cause of the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion:

The observed decrease in atmospheric O2 content over past two decades and the lower O2 content in the northern compared to the SH are consistent with the burning of fossil fuels (see {'Figure_6_3 Figure 6.3} and {Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_3.6_1_3_2 Section 6.1.3.2}; {cite.6.'Keeling_et_al_1996}; {cite.6.'Manning_and_Keeling_2006}). CO2 from fossil fuels and from the land {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} has a lower 13C/12C stable isotope ratio than the CO2 in the atmosphere. This induces a decreasing temporal {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the atmospheric 13C/12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 concentration as well as, on annual average, slightly lower 13C/12C values in the NH ({'Figure_6_3 Figure 6.3}). These signals are measured in the atmosphere. Because fossil fuel CO2 is devoid of radiocarbon ({Glossary.*14C 14C}), reconstructions of the 14C/C isotopic ratio of atmospheric CO2 from {Glossary.*Tree_rings tree rings} show a declining trend, as expected from the addition of fossil CO2 ({cite.6.'Stuiver_and_Quay_1981}; {cite.6.'Levin_et_al_2010}). Yet nuclear weapon tests in the 1950s and 1960s have been offsetting that declining trend signal by adding 14C to the atmosphere. Since this nuclear weapon induced 14C pulse in the atmosphere has been fading, the 14C/C isotopic ratio of atmospheric CO2 is observed to resume its declining trend ({cite.6.'Naegler_and_Levin_2009}; {cite.6.'Graven_et_al_2012}). Most of the fossil fuel CO2 emissions take place in the industrialised countries north of the equator. Consistent with this, on annual average, atmospheric CO2 measurement stations in the NH record increasingly higher CO2 concentrations than stations in the SH, as witnessed by the observations from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and the South Pole (see {'Figure_6_3 Figure 6.3}). The annually averaged concentration difference between the two stations has increased in proportion of the estimated increasing difference in fossil fuel combustion emissions between the hemispheres ({'Figure_6_13 Figure 6.13}; {cite.6.'Keeling_et_al_1989}; {cite.6.'Tans_et_al_1989}; {cite.6.'Fan_et_al_1999}). The rate of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning and land use change was almost exponential, and the rate of CO2 increase in the atmosphere was also almost exponential and about half that of the emissions, consistent with a large body of evidence about changes of carbon inventory in each {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir} of the carbon cycle presented in this chapter.
