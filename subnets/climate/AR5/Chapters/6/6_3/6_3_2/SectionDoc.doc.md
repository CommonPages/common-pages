title: 6.3.2 - Global Carbon Dioxide Budget

Since the IPCC {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.6.'Denman_et_al_2007}), a number of new advancements in data availability and data-model synthesis have allowed the establishment of a more constrained {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} budget and better {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of its flux components. The advancements are: (1) revised data on the rates of {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} conversion from country statistics ({cite.6.'FAO_2010}) now providing an arguably more robust estimate of the land use change flux ({cite.6.'Houghton_et_al_2012}; {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_2 Section 6.3.2.2}); (2) a new global compilation of {Glossary.*Forest forest} inventory data that provides an independent estimate of the amount of carbon that has been gained by forests over the past two decades, albeit with very scarce measurements for tropical forest ({cite.6.'Pan_et_al_2011}); (3) over 2 million new observations of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at the ocean surface have been taken and added to the global databases ({cite.6.'Takahashi_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Pfeil_et_al_2013}) and used to quantify ocean CO2 {Glossary.*Sink sink} variability and trends ({Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5 Section 6.3.2.5}) and to evaluate and constrain models ({cite.6.'Schuster_et_al_2013}; {cite.6.'Wanninkhof_et_al_2013}); and (4) the use of multiple constraints with atmospheric inversions and combined {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}â€“ocean inversions (so called top down approaches; {cite.6.'Jacobson_et_al_2007}) and the up-scaling of {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir}-based observations using models (so called bottom up approaches) provides new coarse scale consistency checks on CO2 flux estimates for land and ocean regions ({cite.6.'McGuire_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Piao_et_al_2009b}; {cite.6.'Schulze_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Ciais_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Schuster_et_al_2013}). The causes of the year-to-year variability observed in the annual atmospheric CO2 {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} shown in {'Figure_6_8 Figure 6.8} are estimated with a medium to high confidence to be mainly driven by terrestrial processes occurring in tropical latitudes as inferred from atmospheric CO2 inversions and supported by ocean data and models ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2000}; {cite.6.'Raupach_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Sarmiento_et_al_2010}) (Figures {'Figure_6_9 6.9} and {'Figure_6_13 6.13}; {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5 Section 6.3.2.5}) and land models ({'Figure_6_16 Figure 6.16}; {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_6 Section 6.3.2.6}).
