title: 6.3.2.4 - Carbon Dioxide Airborne Fraction

Until recently, the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} emissions was large and poorly quantified which led to the use of an {Glossary.*Airborne_fraction airborne fraction} (see Glossary) based on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel only (e.g., {'Figure_7_4 Figure 7.4} in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} and {'Figure_6_26 Figure 6.26} of this chapter). However, reduced uncertainty of emissions from land use change and larger agreement in its trends over time ({Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_2 Section 6.3.2.2}) allow making use of an airborne fraction that includes all {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions. The airborne fraction will increase if emissions are too fast for the {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of CO2 by the carbon sinks ({cite.6.'Bacastow_and_Keeling_1979}; {cite.6.'Gloor_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Raupach_2013}). It is thus controlled by changes in emissions rates, and by changes in carbon sinks driven by rising CO2, changes in climate and all other biogeochemical changes.

A positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} in airborne fraction of ~0.3% yr–1 relative to the mean of 0.44 ±0.06 (or about 0.05 increase over 50 years) was found by all recent studies ({cite.6.'Raupach_et_al_2008}, and related papers; {cite.6.'Knorr_2009}; {cite.6.'Gloor_et_al_2010}) using the airborne fraction of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the approximately 1960–2010 period (for which the most accurate atmospheric CO2 data are available). However, there is no consensus on the significance of the trend because of differences in the treatment of uncertainty and noise ({cite.6.'Raupach_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Knorr_2009}). There is also no consensus on the cause of the trend ({cite.6.'Canadell_et_al_2007b}; {cite.6.'Raupach_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Gloor_et_al_2010}). Land and ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} model results attributing the trends of fluxes to underlying processes suggest that the effect of climate change and variability on ocean and land sinks have had a significant influence (Le Quéré et al., 2009), including the decadal influence of volcanic eruptions (Frölicher et al., 2013).
