title: 6.3.3.3 - Sinks of Atmospheric Methane

The main {Glossary.*Sink sink} of atmospheric {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} is its oxidation by OH radicals, a chemical reaction that takes place mostly in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} ({'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}). OH removes each year an amount of CH4 equivalent to 90% of all surface {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}), that is, 9% of the total burden of CH4 in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, which defines a partial atmospheric {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} with respect to OH of 7 to 11 years for an {Glossary.*Burden atmospheric burden} of 4800 Tg(CH4) (4700 to 4900 TgCH4 as computed by Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project (ACCMIP) atmospheric chemistry models in {cite.6.'Voulgarakis_et_al_2013 Voulgarakis et al. (2013)}, thus slightly different from {'Figure_6_2 Figure 6.2}; see {Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_3.8_2_3_3 Section 8.2.3.3} for ACCMIP models). A recent estimate of the CH4 lifetime is 9.1 ± 0.9 years ({cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012}). A small sink of atmospheric CH4 is suspected, but still debated, in the marine boundary layer due to a chemical reaction with chlorine ({cite.6.'Allan_et_al_2007}). Another small sink is the reaction of CH4 with Cl radicals and O(1D) in the stratosphere ({cite.6.'Shallcross_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Neef_et_al_2010}). Finally, oxidation in upland soils (with oxygen) by methanotrophic bacterias removes about 9 to 47 Tg(CH4) yr–1 ({cite.6.'Curry_2007}; {cite.6.'Dutaur_and_Verchot_2007}; {cite.6.'Spahni_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Ito_and_Inatomi_2012}).

There have been a number of published estimates of global OH concentrations and variations over the past decade ({cite.6.'Prinn_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Dentener_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Prinn_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Rigby_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Montzka_et_al_2011}). The very short lifetime of OH makes it almost impossible to measure directly global OH concentrations in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}. Chemistry transport models (CTMs), chemistry {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} (CCMs) or {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} methods have to be used to obtain a global mean value and time variations. For the 2000s, CTMs and CCMs ({cite.6.'Young_et_al_2013}) estimate a global chemical loss of methane due to OH of 604 Tg(CH4) yr–1 (509 to 764 Tg(CH4) yr–1). This loss is larger, albeit compatible considering the large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, with a recent extensive analysis by {cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012 Prather et al. (2012)} inferring a global chemical loss of 554 ± 56 Tg(CH4) yr–1. Top-down inversions using methyl-chloroform (MCF) measurements to infer OH provide a smaller chemical loss of 518 Tg(CH4) yr–1 with a more narrow range of 510 to 538 Tg(CH4) yr–1 in the 2000s. However, inversion estimates probably do not account for all sources of uncertainties ({cite.6.'Prather_et_al_2012}).

CCMs and CTMs simulate small interannual variations of OH radicals, typically of 1 to 3% (standard deviation over a decade) due to a high buffering of this radical by atmospheric photochemical reactions ({cite.6.'Voulgarakis_et_al_2013}; {cite.6.'Young_et_al_2013}). Atmospheric inversions show much larger variations for the 1980s and the 1990s (5 to 10%), because of their oversensitivity to uncertainties on MCF emissions, when measurements of this tracer are used to reconstruct OH ({cite.6.'Montzka_et_al_2011}), although reduced variations are inferred after 1998 by {cite.6.'Prinn_et_al_2005 Prinn et al. (2005)}. For the 2000s, the reduction of MCF in the atmosphere, due to the Montreal protocol (1987) and its further amendments, allows a consistent estimate of small OH variations between atmospheric inversions (<±5%) and CCMs/CTMs (<±3%). However, the very low atmospheric values reached by MCF (few ppt in 2010) impose the need to find another tracer to reconstruct global OH in the upcoming years. Finally, evidence for the role of changes in OH concentrations in explaining the increase in atmospheric methane since 2007 is variable, ranging from a significant contribution ({cite.6.'Rigby_et_al_2008}) to only a small role ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2011}).
