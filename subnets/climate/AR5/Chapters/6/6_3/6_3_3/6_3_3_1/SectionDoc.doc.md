title: 6.3.3.1 - Atmospheric Changes

Since the beginning of the Industrial Era, the atmospheric {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} concentration increased by a factor of 2.5 (from 722 ppb to 1803 ppb in 2011).

CH4 is currently measured by a network of more than 100 surface sites ({cite.6.'Blake_et_al_1982}; {cite.6.'Cunnold_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Langenfelds_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2011}), aircraft profiles ({cite.6.'Brenninkmeijer_et_al_2007}), satellite ({cite.6.'Wecht_et_al_2012}; {cite.6.'Worden_et_al_2012}) and before 1979 from analyses of firn air and ice cores (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2 Section 5.2.2} and {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2}, and {'Figure_6_11 Figure 6.11}). The growth of CH4 in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is largely in response to increasing {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions}. The vertically averaged atmospheric CH4 concentration field can be mapped by remote sensing from the surface using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments (Total Carbon Column Observing Network, TCCON, http://www.tccon.caltech.edu/) and from space by several satellite instruments: Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS, since 2002; http:// airs.jpl.nasa.gov), Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES, since 2004; http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov), Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI, since 2006; Crévoisier et al., 2009), Scanning Imaging Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY, 2003–2012; {cite.6.'Frankenberg_et_al_2008}), and Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite-Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (GOSAT-TANSO-FTS, since 2009; {cite.6.'Morino_et_al_2011}). As an example, SCIAMACHY shows the column CH4 gradient between the two hemispheres as well as increased concentrations over Southeast Asia, due to emissions from agriculture, wetlands, waste and energy production ({cite.6.'Frankenberg_et_al_2008}). In situ observations provide very precise measurements (~0.2%) but unevenly located at the surface of the globe. Satellite data offer a global coverage at the cost of a lower precision on individual measurements (~2%) and possible biases ({cite.6.'Bergamaschi_et_al_2009}).

The growth rate of CH4 has declined since the mid-1980s, and a near zero growth rate (quasi-stable concentrations) was observed during 1999–2006, suggesting an approach to steady state where the sum of emissions are in balance with the sum of sinks ({cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Khalil_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Patra_et_al_2011}; {'Figure_6_18 Figure 6.18}). The reasons for this growth rate decline after the mid-1980s are still debated, and results from various studies provide possible {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}: (1) a reduction of anthropogenic emitting activities such as coal mining, gas industry and/or animal husbandry, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union ({cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2003}; {cite.6.'Chen_and_Prinn_2006}; {cite.6.'Savolainen_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Simpson_et_al_2012}); (2) a compensation between increasing anthropogenic emissions and decreasing wetland emissions ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Chen_and_Prinn_2006}); (3) significant ({cite.6.'Rigby_et_al_2008}) to small ({cite.6.'Montzka_et_al_2011}) changes in OH concentrations and/or based on two different 13CH4 data sets; (4) reduced emissions from rice paddies {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to changes in agricultural practices ({cite.6.'Kai_et_al_2011}); or (5) stable microbial and {Glossary.*Fossil_fuel_emissions fossil fuel emissions} from 1990 to 2005 ({cite.6.'Levin_et_al_2012}).

Since 2007, atmospheric CH4 has been observed to increase again ({cite.6.'Rigby_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2009}) with positive anomalies of emissions of 21 Tg(CH4) yr–1 and 18 Tg(CH4) yr–1 estimated by inversions during 2007 and 2008, respectively ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2011}) as compared to the 1999–2006 period. The increase of emissions in 2007–2008 was dominated by tropical regions ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2011}), with a major contribution from tropical wetlands and some contribution from high-latitude wetlands during the 2007 anomaly ({cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2011}). This increase is suggested by the growth rate over latitude in {'Figure_6_18 Figure 6.18} ({cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2009}). The recent increase of CH4 concentration since 2007 is also consistent with anthropogenic emission inventories, which show more (EDGAR v4.2) or less ({cite.6.'EPA_2011a}) rapidly increasing anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the period 2000–2008. This is related to increased energy production in growing Asian economies (EDGAR, edgar.jrc.ec.europa. eu; EPA, http://www.epa.gov/nonco2/econ-inv/international.html). The atmospheric increase has continued after 2009, at a rate of 4 to 5 ppb yr–1 ({cite.6.'Sussmann_et_al_2012}).
