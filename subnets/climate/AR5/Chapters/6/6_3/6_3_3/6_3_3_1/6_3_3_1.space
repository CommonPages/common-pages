  |Since the beginning of the Industrial Era, the atmospheric {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} concentration increased by a factor of 2.5. The growth of CH4 in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is largely in response to increasing {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions}. The growth rate has declined since the mid-1980s, and a near zero rate was observed during 1999â€“2006. Since 2007, atmospheric CH4 has been observed to increase again, consistent with rapidly increasing CH4 emissions related to increased energy production in growing Asian economies.
