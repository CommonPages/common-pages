title: 6.3.3 - Global Methane Budget

AR5 is the first IPCC assessment report providing a consistent synthesis of the {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} budget per decade using multiple atmospheric CH4 inversion models (top-down) and process-based models and inventories (bottom-up). {'Table_6_8 Table 6.8} shows the budgets for the decades of 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Uncertainties on {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and sinks are listed using minimum and maximum of each published estimate for each decade. Bottom-up approaches are used to attribute decadal budgets to individual processes emitting CH4 (see {Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_1.6_1_1_2 Section 6.1.1.2} for a general overview). Top-down inversions provide an atmospheric-based constraint mostly for the total CH4 {Glossary.*Source source} per {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, and the use of additional observations(e.g.,{Glossary.*Isotopes isotopes})allowsinferringemissionspersourcetype. Estimates of CH4 sinks in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} by reaction with tropospheric OH, in soils and in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} are also presented. Despite significant progress since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} remain in the present knowledge of the budget and its evolution over time.
