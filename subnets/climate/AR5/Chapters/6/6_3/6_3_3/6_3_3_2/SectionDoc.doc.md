title: 6.3.3.2 - Methane Emissions

The {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} growth rate results from the balance between {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and sinks. Methane emissions around the globe are biogenic, thermogenic or pyrogenic in origin ({cite.6.'Neef_et_al_2010}), and they can be the direct result of either {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities} and/or natural processes (see {Chapters.6.6_1.6_1_1.6_1_1_2 Section 6.1.1.2} and {'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}). Biogenic sources are due to degradation of organic matter in anaerobic conditions (natural wetlands, ruminants, waste, landfills, rice paddies, fresh waters, termites). Thermogenic sources come from the slow transformation of organic matter into fossil fuels on geological time scales (natural gas, coal, oil). Pyrogenic sources are due to incomplete combustion of organic matter (biomass and biofuel burning). Some sources can eventually combine a biogenic and a thermogenic origin (e.g., natural geological sources such as oceanic seeps, mud volcanoes or hydrates). Each of these three types of emissions is characterized by ranges in its isotopic composition in13CCH4: typically –55 to –70‰ for biogenic, –25 to –45‰ for thermogenic, and –13 to –25‰ for pyrogenic. These isotopic distinctions provide a basis for attempting to separate the relative contribution of different methane sources using the top-down approach ({cite.6.'Bousquet_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Neef_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Monteil_et_al_2011}).

During the decade of the 2000s, natural sources of CH4 account for 35 to 50% of the decadal mean global emissions ({'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}). The single most dominant CH4 {Glossary.*Source source} of the global flux and interannual variability is CH4 emissions from wetlands (177 to 284 Tg(CH4) yr–1). With high confidence, climate driven changes of emissions from wetlands are the main drivers of the global inter-annual variability of CH4 emissions. The term ‘wetlands’ denotes here a variety of ecosystems emitting CH4 in the tropics and the high latitudes: wet soils, swamps, bogs and peatlands. These emissions are highly sensitive to climate change and variability, as shown, for instance, from the high CH4 growth rate in 2007–2008 that coincides with positive precipitation and temperature anomalies ({cite.6.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2009}). Several process-based models of methane emissions from wetlands have been developed and improved since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.6.'Hodson_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Ringeval_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Spahni_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Melton_et_al_2013}), yet the confidence in modeled wetland CH4 emissions remains low, particularly because of limited observational data sets available for model calibration and evaluation. Spatial distribution and temporal variability of wetlands also remains highly unconstrained in spite the existence of some remote sensing products ({cite.6.'Papa_et_al_2010}). It has been observed that wetland CH4 emissions increase in response to elevated atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations (van Groenigen et al., 2011). van Groenigen et al. attribute such an increase in CH4 emissions from natural wetlands to increasing {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} due to the reduced plant demand for water under higher CO2. However, the sign and magnitude of the CH4 emission response to changes in temperature and precipitation vary among models but show, on average, a decrease of wetland area and CH4 flux with increasing temperature, especially in the tropics, and a modest (~4%) increase of wetland area and CH4 flux with increasing precipitation ({cite.6.'Melton_et_al_2013}).

In AR4, natural geological sources were estimated between 4 and 19 Tg(CH4) yr–1. Since then, {cite.6.'Etiope_et_al_2008 Etiope et al. (2008)} provided improved emission estimates from terrestrial (13 to 29 Tg(CH4) yr–1) and marine (~20 Tg(CH4) yr–1) seepages, mud volcanoes (6 to 9 Tg(CH4) yr–1), hydrates (5 to 10 Tg(CH4) yr–1) and geothermal and volcanic areas (3 to 6 Tg(CH4) yr–1), which represent altogether between 42 and 64 Tg(CH4) yr–1 (see {'Table_6_8 Table 6.8} for full range of estimates). This contribution from natural, geological and partly fossil CH4 is larger than in AR4 and consistent with a 14CH4 {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} showing natural and anthropogenic fossil contributions to the global CH4 budget to be around 30% (medium confidence) ({cite.6.'Lassey_et_al_2007}) and not around 20% as previously estimated (e.g., AR4). However, such a large percentage was not confirmed by an analysis of the global atmospheric record of ethane ({cite.6.'Simpson_et_al_2012}) which is co-emitted with geological CH4.

Of the natural sources of CH4, emissions from thawing {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} and CH4 hydrates in the northern circumpolar {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} will become potentially important in the 21st century because they could increase dramatically due to the rapid climate warming of the Arctic and the large carbon pools stored there ({cite.6.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}; Walter Anthony et al., 2012) (see {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_3.6_4_3_4 Section 6.4.3.4}). Hydrates are, however, estimated to represent only a very small emission, between 2 and 9 Tg(CH4) yr–1 under the current time period ({'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}). Supersaturation of dissolved CH4 at the bottom and surface waters in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf indicate some CH4 activity across the region, with a net sea–air flux of 10.5 Tg(CH4) yr–1 which is similar in magnitude to the flux for the entire ocean ({cite.6.'Shakhova_et_al_2010}) but it is not possible to say whether this source has always been present or is a consequence of recent Arctic changes. The ebullition of CH4 from decomposing, thawing lake sediments in north Siberia with an estimated flux of ~4 Tg(CH4) yr−1 is another demonstration of the activity of this region and of its potential importance in the future ({cite.6.'Walter_et_al_2006}; van Huissteden et al., 2011). The sum of all natural emission estimates other than wetlands is still very uncertain based on bottom-up studies [see {'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}, range of 238 to 484 Tg(CH4) yr–1 for 2000–2009].

Pyrogenic sources of CH4 (biomass burning in {'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}) are assessed to have a small contribution in the global flux for the 2000s (32 to 39 Tg(CH4) yr−1). {Glossary.*Biomass Biomass} burning of tropical and boreal forests (17 to 21 Tg(CH4) yr−1) play a much smaller role than wetlands in interannual variability of emissions, except during intensive fire periods ({cite.6.'Langenfelds_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Simpson_et_al_2006}). Only during the 1997–1998 record strong El Niño, burning of forests and peatland that took place in Indonesia and Malaysia, released ~12 Tg(CH4) and contributed to the observed growth rate anomaly ({cite.6.'Langenfelds_et_al_2002}; van der Werf et al., 2004). Other smaller fire CH4 emissions positive anomalies were suggested over the northern mid-latitudes in 2002–2003, in particular over Eastern Siberia in 2003 (van der Werf et al., 2010) and Russia in 2010. Traditional biofuel burning is estimated to be a source of 14 to 17 Tg(CH4) yr–1({cite.6.'Andreae_and_Merlet_2001}; {cite.6.'Yevich_and_Logan_2003}).

Keppler at al. (2006) reported that plants under aerobic conditions were able to emit CH4, and thus potentially could constitute a large additional emission, which had not been previously considered in the global CH4 budget. Later studies do not support plant emissions as a widespread mechanism ({cite.6.'Dueck_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Nisbet_et_al_2009}) or show small to negligible emissions in the context of the global CH4 budget ({cite.6.'Vigano_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Nisbet_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Bloom_et_al_2010}). Alternative mechanisms have been suggested to explain an apparent aerobic CH4 production, which involve (1) adsorption and desorption ({cite.6.'Kirschbaum_and_Walcroft_2008}; {cite.6.'Nisbet_et_al_2009}), (2) degradation of organic matter under strong ultraviolet (UV) light ({cite.6.'Dueck_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Nisbet_et_al_2009}) and (3) methane in the groundwater emitted through internal air spaces in tree bodies ({cite.6.'Terazawa_et_al_2007}). Overall, a significant emission of CH4 by plants under aerobic conditions is very unlikely, and this source is not reported in {'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}.

{Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} CH4 sources are estimated to range between 50% and 65% of the global emissions for the 2000s ({'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}). They include rice paddies agriculture, ruminant animals, sewage and waste, landfills, and fossil fuel extraction, storage, transformation, transportation and use (coal mining, gas and oil industries). Anthropogenic sources are dominant over natural sources in top-down inversions (~65%) but they are of the same magnitude in bottom-up models and inventories ({'Table_6_8 Table 6.8}). Rice paddies emit between 33 to 40 Tg(CH4) yr–1 and 90% of these emissions come from tropical Asia, with more than 50% from China and India ({cite.6.'Yan_et_al_2009}). Ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, etc. produce CH4 by food fermentation in their anoxic rumens with a total estimate of between 87 and 94 Tg(CH4) yr–1. Major regional contributions of this flux come from India, China, Brazil and the USA ({cite.6.'EPA_2006}; Olivier and Janssens-Maenhout, 2012), EDGAR v4.2. India, with the world’s largest livestock population emitted 11.8 Tg(CH4) yr–1 in 2003, including emission from enteric fermentation (10.7 Tg(CH4) yr–1) and manure management (1.1 Tg(CH4) yr–1; {cite.6.'Chhabra_et_al_2013}). Methanogenesis in landfills, livestock manure and waste waters produces between 67 and 90 Tg(CH4) yr–1 due to anoxic conditions and a high availability of acetate, CO2 and H2. Loss of natural gas (~90% CH4) is the largest contributor to fossil fuel related fugitive emissions, estimated between 85 and 105 Tg(CH4) yr–1 in the USA ({cite.6.'EPA_2006}; Olivier and Janssens-Maenhout, 2012), EDGAR v4.2.
