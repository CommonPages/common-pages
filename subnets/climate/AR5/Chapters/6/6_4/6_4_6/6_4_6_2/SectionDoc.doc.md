title: 6.4.6.2 - Projected Changes in Sulphur Deposition

Given the tight coupling between the atmospheric nitrogen and sulphur cycles, and the impact on climate ({Chapters.7.7_3 Section 7.3}) this Chapter also presents {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} for sulphur deposition. Deposition of SOx is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} to decrease in all RCP pathways (Figures {'Figure_6_33 6.33} and {'Figure_6_34 6.34}). By contrast, scenarios established prior to {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} indicated decreases of sulphur deposition in North America and Europe, but increases in South America, Africa, South and East Asia ({cite.6.'Dentener_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Tagaris_et_al_2008}). In all RCPs, sulphur deposition is lower by 2100 than in 2000 in all regions, with the largest decreases in North America, Europe and Asia ({Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} and RCP 8.5 are seen in {'Figure_6_34 Figure 6.34}; {Glossary.*RCP4_5_and_RCP6_0 RCP4.5 and RCP6.0} are in the Supplementary Material) ({cite.6.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}). Future hot spots of deposition are still evident in East and South East Asia, especially for RCP6.0.

Projected future increase of Nr input into terrestrial ecosystems also yields increased flux of Nr from rivers into coastal systems. As illustrated by the Global NEWS 2 model for 2050, by the base year 2000, the discharge of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to marine coastal waters was >500 kg N kmâ€“2 of watershed area for most watershed systems downstream of either high population or extensive agricultural activity ({cite.6.'Mayorga_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Seitzinger_et_al_2010}). Additional information and the supporting figure are found in the Supplementary Material.
