title: 6.4.6.3 - Impact of Future Changes in Reactive Nitrogen on Carbon Uptake and Storage

{Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} Nr addition and natural nitrogen-cycle responses to global changes will have an important impact on the global {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}. As a principal nutrient for plant growth, nitrogen can both limit future carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} and stimulate it depending on changes in Nr availability. A range of global terrestrial carbon cycle models have been developed since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} that integrate nitrogen dynamics into the simulation of land carbon cycling ({cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Wang_et_al_2007}, 2010a; {cite.6.'Sokolov_et_al_2008}; Xu-Ri and Prentice, 2008; {cite.6.'Churkina_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Jain_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Fisher_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Gerber_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Friend_2010}; {cite.6.'Esser_et_al_2011}). However, only two {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} in CMIP5 (CESM1-BGC and NorESM1-ME) include a description of nitrogen–carbon interactions.

In response to climate warming, increased decomposition of soil organic matter increases nitrogen mineralisation, (high confidence) which can enhance Nr uptake and carbon storage by vegetation. Generally, higher C:N ratio in woody vegetation compared to C:N ratio of soil organic matter causes increased {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} carbon storage as increased Nr uptake shifts nitrogen from soil to vegetation ({cite.6.'Melillo_et_al_2011}). In two studies ({cite.6.'Sokolov_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2009}), this effect was strong enough to turn the carbon–climate interaction into a small negative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback}, that is, an increased land {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} uptake in response to climate warming (positive γL values in {'Figure_6_20 Figure 6.20}), whereas in another study that described carbon–nitrogen interactions ({cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2010b}) the carbon–climate interaction was reduced but remained positive, that is, decreased land CO2 uptake in response to climate change (negative γL values in Figures {'Figure_6_20 6.20}, {'Figure_6_21 6.21} and {'Figure_6_22 6.22}). The two CMIP5 ESMs which include terrestrial carbon–nitrogen interactions ({'Table_6_11 Table 6.11}) also simulate a small but positive climate–carbon feedback.

{table:'Table_6_11}

Consistent with the observational evidence ({cite.6.'Finzi_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Palmroth_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Norby_et_al_2010}), modelling studies have shown a strong effect of Nr availability in limiting the response of plant growth and land carbon storage to elevated atmospheric CO2 (e.g., {cite.6.'Sokolov_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Friend_2010}). These analyses are affected by the projected future trajectories of anthropogenic Nr deposition. The effects of Nr deposition counteract the nitrogen limitation of CO2 fertilisation ({cite.6.'Churkina_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2010a}). Estimates of the total net carbon storage on land due to Nr deposition between 1860 and 2100 range between 27 and 66 PgC ({cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2010a}).

It is very likely that, at the global scale, nutrient limitation will reduce the global land carbon storage projected by CMIP5 carbon-cycle only models. Only two of the current CMIP5 ESM models explicitly consider carbon–nitrogen interactions (CESM1-BGC and NorESM1-ME).

The effect of the nitrogen limitations on terrestrial carbon {Glossary.*Sequestration sequestration} in the results of the other CMIP5 models may be approximated by comparing the implicit Nr requirement given plausible ranges of terrestrial C:N stoichiometry ({cite.6.'Wang_and_Houlton_2009}) to plausible increases in terrestrial Nr supply due to increased biological nitrogen fixation ({cite.6.'Wang_and_Houlton_2009}) and anthropogenic Nr deposition ({'Figure_6_35 Figure 6.35}). For the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} under the RCP 8.5 scenario, this implies a lack of available nitrogen of 1.3 to 13.1 PgN which would reduce terrestrial C sequestration by an average of 137 PgC over the period 1860–2100, with a range of 41 to 273 PgC among models. This represents an ensemble mean reduction in land carbon sequestration of 55%, with a large spread across models (14 to 196%). Inferred reductions in ensemble-mean land carbon {Glossary.*Sink sink} over the same period for {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6 are 109, 117 and 85 PgC, respectively. Between-model variation in these inferred reduced land carbon sinks is similar for all RCPs, with ranges of 57 to 162 PgC, 38 to 208 PgC, and 32 to 171 PgC for RCPs 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6, respectively. The influence of nutrient addition for agriculture and pasture management is not addressed in this analysis. Results from the two CMIP5 models with explicit carbon–nitrogen interactions show even lower land carbon sequestration than obtained by this approximation method ({'Figure_6_35 Figure 6.35}). More models with explicit carbon–nitrogen interactions are needed to understand between-model variation and construct an ensemble response.

The positive effect on land carbon storage due to climate-increased Nr {Glossary.*Mineralization_Remineralization mineralization} is of comparable magnitude to the land carbon storage increase associated with increased anthropogenic Nr deposition. Models disagree, however, which of the two factors is more important, with both effects dependent on the choice of scenario. Crucially, the effect of nitrogen limitation on vegetation growth and carbon storage under elevated CO2 is the strongest effect of the natural and disturbed nitrogen cycle on terrestrial carbon dynamics ({cite.6.'Bonan_and_Levis_2010}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2010a}). In consequence, the projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations (and thus degree of climate change) in 2100 are higher in projections with models describing nitrogen limitations than in those same models without these interactions. The influence of current and future {Glossary.*Nitrogen_deposition nitrogen deposition} on the ocean sink for anthropogenic carbon is estimated to be rather small, with less than 5% of the ocean carbon sink in 2100 attributable to fertilisation from anthropogenic Nr deposition over the oceans ({cite.6.'Reay_et_al_2008}).

None of the CMIP5 models include phosphorus as a limiting nutrient for land ecosystems, although this limitation and interactions with Nr availability are observed in many systems ({cite.6.'Elser_et_al_2007}). Limitation by Nr availability alone may act as a partial surrogate for combined nitrogen–phosphorus limitation ({cite.6.'Thornton_et_al_2009}; {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_8.6_4_8_2 Section 6.4.8.2}), but are likely to underestimate the overall nutrient limitation, especially in lowland tropical {Glossary.*Forest forest}.
