title: 6.4.6.1 - Projections for Formation of Reactive Nitrogen by Human Activity

Since the 1970s, food production, industrial activity and fossil fuel combustion have resulted in the creation of more reactive nitrogen (Nr) than natural terrestrial processes ({Chapters.6.6_1 Section 6.1}; {Box_6_2 Box 6.2}, {'Box_6_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}). Building on the general description of the set of {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} Special Report on Emission (SRES) {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, {cite.6.'Erisman_et_al_2008 Erisman et al. (2008)} estimated {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} nitrogen fertiliser consumption throughout the 21st century. Five driving parameters (population growth, consumption of animal protein, agricultural efficiency improvement and additional biofuel production) are used to project future nitrogen demands for four scenarios (A1, B1, A2 and B2) ({'Figure_6_31 Figure 6.31}). Assigning these drivers to these four {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios}, they estimated a production of Nr for agricultural use of 90 to 190 TgN yr–1 by 2100, a range that spans from slightly less to almost twice as much current fertiliser consumption rates ({Chapters.6.6_1 Section 6.1}, {'Figure_6_4 Figure 6.4}a, Figure 1 in {Box_6_2 Box 6.2}).

Despite the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and the non-inclusion of many important drivers, three of the scenarios generated by the {cite.6.'Erisman_et_al_2008 Erisman et al. (2008)} model point towards an increase in future production of reactive nitrogen. In particular, the A1 scenario which assumes a world with rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks mid-century and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies ends up as the potentially largest contributor to nitrogen use, as a result of large amounts of biofuels required and the fertiliser used to produce it. This increase in nitrogen use is assumed to be largely in line with the {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} scenario, where it appears to have rather limited adverse effects like increasing {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (van Vuuren et al., 2011).

N2O emissions are projected to increase from increased anthropogenic Nr production. It is thus likely that N2O emissions from soils will increase due to the increased demand for feed/food and the reliance of agriculture on nitrogen fertilisers. This is illustrated by the comparison of emissions from 1900 to those in 2000 and 2050, using the IAM IMAGE model that served to define the RCP2.6 pathway ({'Figure_6_32 Figure 6.32}). The anthropogenic N2O emission map IN 2050 shown in {'Figure_6_32 Figure 6.32} is established from the RCP4.5 scenario; the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} and RCP6 scenarios have much higher emissions, and RCP2.6 much lower (van Vuuren et al., 2011). A spatially explicit inventory of soil nitrogen budgets in livestock and crop production systems using the IMAGE model ({cite.6.'Bouwman_et_al_2011}) shows that between 1900 and 1950, the global soil Nr budget surplus almost doubled to 36 TgN yr–1, and further increased to 138 TgN yr–1 between 1950 and 2000. The IMAGE model scenario from {cite.6.'Bouwman_et_al_2011 Bouwman et al. (2011)} shown in {'Figure_6_32 Figure 6.32} portrays a world with a further increasing global crop production (+82% for 2000–2050) and livestock production (+115%). Despite the assumed rapid increase in nitrogen use efficiency in crop (+35%) and livestock (+35%) production, global agricultural Nr surpluses are projected to continue to increase (+23%), and associated emissions of N2O to triple compared to 1900 levels.

Regional to global scale model simulations suggest a strong effect of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} on interannual variability of land N2O emissions ({cite.6.'Tian_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Zaehle_et_al_2011}; Xu-Ri et al., 2012). {cite.6.'Kesik_et_al_2006 Kesik et al. (2006)} found for European forests that higher temperatures and lower {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} will decrease future N2O emissions under scenarios of climate change, despite local increases of emission rates by up to 20%. Xu-Ri et al. (2012) show that local climate trends result in a spatially diverse pattern of increases and decreases of N2O emissions, which globally integrated result in a net {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} of N2O emissions of 1 TgN yr–1 per 1°C of land temperature warming. Using a further development of this model, {cite.6.'Stocker_et_al_2013 Stocker et al. (2013)} estimate increases in terrestrial N2O from a pre-industrial terrestrial {Glossary.*Source source} of 6.9 TgN (N2O) yr–1 to 9.8 to 11.1 TgN (N2O) yr–1 (RCP 2.6) and 14.2 to 17.0 TgN (N2O) yr–1 (RCP 8.5) by 2100. Of these increases, 1.1 to 2.4 TgN (N2O) yr–1 (RCP 2.6) or 4.7 to 7.7 TgN (N2O) yr–1 (RCP 8.5) are due to the interacting effects of climate and {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} on N2O emissions from natural and agricultural ecosystems. An independent modelling study suggested a climate change related increase of N2O emissions between 1860 and 2100 by 3.1 TgN (N2O) yr–1 for the A2 SRES scenario ({cite.6.'Zaehle_2013}) implying a slightly lower sensitivity of soil N2O emissions to climate of 0.5 TgN (N2O) yr–1 per 1°C warming. While the present-day contribution of these climate-mediated effects on the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} from N2O is likely to be small (0.016 W m–2 °C–1; {cite.6.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}). Modelling results ({cite.6.'Stocker_et_al_2013}) suggest that the climate and CO2-related amplification of terrestrial N2O emissions imply a larger {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} of 0.03 to 0.05 W m–2 °C–1 by 2100.

With the continuing increases in the formation of Nr from anthropogenic activities will come increased Nr emissions and distribution of Nr by waters and the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. For the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, the main driver of future global {Glossary.*Nitrogen_deposition nitrogen deposition} is the emission trajectories of NOy and NH3. For all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6, nitrogen deposition is projected to remain relatively constant globally although there is a projected increase in NHx deposition and decrease in NOy deposition. On a regional basis, future decreases of NHx and NOx are projected in North America and northern Europe, and increases in Asia ({'Figure_6_33 Figure 6.33}). Spatially, projected changes in total nitrogen deposition driven primarily by increases in NHx emissions occur over large regions of the world for all {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}, with generally the largest in RCP8.5 and the smallest in RCP2.6 ({'Figure_6_33 Figure 6.33}) (Supplementary Material has {Glossary.*RCP4_5_and_RCP6_0 RCP4.5 and RCP6.0}). Previous IPCC scenarios (SRES A2 or IS92a) project a near doubling of atmospheric nitrogen deposition over some world biodiversity hotspots with half of these hotspots subjected to deposition rates greater than 15 kgN ha–1 yr–1 (critical load threshold value) over at least 10% of their total area ({cite.6.'Dentener_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Phoenix_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Bleeker_et_al_2011}).

Large uncertainties remain in our understanding and modelling of changes in Nr emissions, atmospheric transport and deposition processes, lead to low confidence in the {Glossary.*Projection projection} of future Nr deposition fluxes, particularly in regions remote from anthropogenic emissions ({cite.6.'Dentener_et_al_2006}). The large spread between atmospheric {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} models associated with precipitation {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} confounds extraction of a climate signal in deposition projections ({cite.6.'Langner_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Hedegaard_et_al_2008}).
