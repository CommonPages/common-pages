title: 6.4.7 - Future Changes in Methane Emissions

Future atmospheric {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} concentrations are sensitive to changes in both {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and OH oxidation. Atmospheric chemistry is not covered in this chapter and we assess here future changes in natural CH4 emissions in response to climate change (e.g., Oâ€™Connor et al., 2010; {'Figure_6_36 Figure 6.36}). Projected increases in future fire occurrence ({Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_8.6_4_8_1 Section 6.4.8.1}) suggest that CH4 from fires may increase (low confidence). Future changes in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions due to anthropogenic alteration of wetlands (e.g., peatland drainage) may also be important but are not assessed here.
