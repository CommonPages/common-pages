title: 6.4.7.2 - Future Methane Emissions from Permafrost Areas

{Glossary.*Permafrost Permafrost} thaw may lead to increased drainage and a net reduction in lakes and wetlands, a process that has already begun to be seen in lakes in the discontinuous permafrost zone ({cite.6.'Smith_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Jones_et_al_2011}) and has been projected to continue under future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} ({cite.6.'Avis_et_al_2011}). Alternatively, small lakes or ponds and wetland growth may occur in continuous permafrost areas underlain by ice-rich material subject to {Glossary.*Thermokarst thermokarst} ({cite.6.'Christensen_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Jorgenson_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Plug_and_West_2009}; {cite.6.'Jones_et_al_2011}).

There is high agreement between land surface models that permafrost extent is expected to reduce during the 21st century, accompanying particularly rapid warming at high latitudes ({Chapters.12 Chapter 12}). However, estimates vary widely as to the pace of degradation ({cite.6.'Lawrence_and_Slater_2005}; {cite.6.'Burn_and_Nelson_2006}; {cite.6.'Lawrence_et_al_2008}). The LPJWHyMe model projected permafrost area loss of 30% (SRES B1) and 47% (SRES A2) by 2100 ({cite.6.'Wania_2007}). Marchenko et al. (2008) calculate that by 2100, 57% of Alaska will lose permafrost within the top 2 m. For the RCP scenarios, the CMIP5 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} shows a wide range of {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} for permafrost loss: 15 to 87% under RCP4.5 and 30 to 99% under {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} ({cite.6.'Koven_et_al_2013}).

Hydrological changes may lead to tradeoffs between the {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} balance of ecosystems underlain by permafrost, with methane production rates being roughly an order of magnitude less than rates of oxic decomposition to CO2 but CH4 having a larger greenhouse warming potential ({cite.6.'Frolking_and_Roulet_2007}). The extent of permafrost thaw simulated by {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} has been used to estimate possible subsequent carbon release ({cite.6.'Burke_et_al_2013}; {cite.6.'Harden_et_al_2012}; {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_3.6_4_3_4 Section 6.4.3.4}) but few studies explicitly partition this into CO2 or CH4 release to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Schneider von Deimling et al. (2012) estimate cumulative CH4 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} by 2100 between 131 and 533 Tg(CH4) across the 4 {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}. CMIP5 projections of permafrost thaw do not consider changes in pond or lake formation. Thawing of unsaturated Yedoma carbon deposits (which contain large, but uncertain amounts of organic carbon in permafrost in northeast Siberia; {cite.6.'Schirrmeister_et_al_2011}) was postulated to produce significant CH4 emissions ({cite.6.'Khvorostyanov_et_al_2008}), however more recent estimates with Yedoma carbon lability constrained by incubation observations ({cite.6.'Dutta_et_al_2006}) argue for smaller emissions at 2100 ({cite.6.'Koven_et_al_2011}).
