title: 6.4.9 - The Long-term Carbon Cycle and Commitments

With very high confidence, the physical, biogeochemical {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} in the ocean and on land will continue to respond to climate change and rising atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations created during the 21st century. Long-term changes in vegetation structure and induced carbon storage potentially show larger changes beyond 2100 than during the 21st century as the long time scale response of tree growth and {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} migrations means that by 2100 only a part of the eventual committed change will be realized ({cite.6.'Jones_et_al_2009}). {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} changes in tree-line lagged changes in climate by centuries ({cite.6.'MacDonald_et_al_2008}). Long-term ‘commitments’ to ecosystems migration also carry long-term committed effects to changes in terrestrial carbon storage ({cite.6.'Jones_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Liddicoat_et_al_2013}) and {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} (O’Connor et al., 2010; Sections {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_3.6_4_3_3 6.4.3.3} and {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_7 6.4.7}).

Warming of high latitudes is common to most {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({Chapters.12 Chapter 12}) and this may enable increased productivity and northward expansion of boreal {Glossary.*Forest forest} ecosystems into present tundra regions depending on nutrient availability (Kellomäki et al., 2008; {cite.6.'Kurz_et_al_2008a}; {cite.6.'MacDonald_et_al_2008}). CMIP5 simulations by two {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} with dynamic vegetation for extended RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} to 2300 ({cite.6.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011}) allow analysis of this longer term response of the carbon cycle. Increases in tree cover and terrestrial carbon storage north of 60°N are shown in {'Figure_6_38 Figure 6.38}.

Increases in fire disturbance or insect damage may drive loss of forest in temperate regions (Kurz et al., 2008c), but this process is poorly represented or not accounted at all in models. Recent evidence from models ({cite.6.'Huntingford_et_al_2013}) and studies on {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({cite.6.'Cox_et_al_2013}) suggests that large scale loss of tropical forest as previously {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} in some models ({cite.6.'Cox_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Scholze_et_al_2006}) is unlikely, but depends strongly on the {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} future changes in regional temperature ({cite.6.'Galbraith_et_al_2010}) and precipitation ({cite.6.'Good_et_al_2011}, 2013), although both models here simulate reduced tree cover and carbon storage for the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario. ESMs also poorly simulate resilience of ecosystems to climate changes and usually do not account for possible existence of alternative ecosystem states such as tropical forest or savannah ({cite.6.'Hirota_et_al_2011}).

Regional specific changes in ecosystem composition and carbon storage are uncertain but it is very likely that ecosystems will continue to change for decades to centuries following stabilisation of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and climate change.
