title: 6.4.4 - Future Ocean Acidification

A fraction of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} emitted to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} dissolves in the ocean, reducing surface ocean {Glossary.*pH pH} and carbonate ion concentrations. The associated chemistry response to a given change in CO2 concentration is known with very high confidence. Overall, given evidence from {Chapters.3 Chapter 3} and model results from this chapter, it is virtually certain that the increased storage of carbon by the ocean will increase acidification in the future, continuing the observed trends of the past decades. Expected future changes are in line with what is measured at ocean time series stations (see {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}). Multi-model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} using ocean process-based {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} models discussed in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} demonstrate large decreases in pH and carbonate ion concentration [CO32–] during the 21st century throughout the world oceans ({cite.6.'Orr_et_al_2005}). The largest decrease in surface [CO32–] occur in the warmer low and mid-latitudes, which are naturally rich in this ion ({cite.6.'Feely_et_al_2009}). However, it is the low ΩA waters in the high latitudes and in the upwelling regions that first become undersaturated with respect to aragonite (i.e., ΩA <1, where ΩA = [Ca+2][CO32–]/Ksp, where Ksp is the solubility product for the metastable form of CaCO3 known as aragonite; a value of ΩA <1 thus indicates aragonite undersaturation). This aragonite undersaturation in surface waters is reached before the end of the 21st century in the Southern Ocean as highlighted in AR4, but occurs sooner and is more intense in the Arctic ({cite.6.'Steinacher_et_al_2009}). Ten percent of Arctic surface waters are projected to become undersaturated when atmospheric CO2 reaches 428 ppm (by 2025 under all IPCC SRES {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}). That proportion increases to 50% when atmospheric CO2 reaches 534 ppm ({cite.6.'Steinacher_et_al_2009}). By 2100 under the A2 scenario, much of the Arctic surface is projected to become undersaturated with respect to calcite ({cite.6.'Feely_et_al_2009}). Surface waters would then be corrosive to all CaCO3 minerals. These general trends are confirmed by the latest projections from the CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} models (Figure {'Figure_6_28 6.28} and {'Figure_6_29 6.29}). Between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100, decrease in global-mean surface pH is 0.065 (0.06 to 0.07) for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, 0.145 (0.14 to 0.15) for RCP4.5, 0.203 (0.20 to 0.21) for RCP6.0 and 0.31 (0.30 to 0.32) for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} (range from CMIP5 models spread).

Surface CaCO3 saturation also varies seasonally, particularly in the high latitudes, where observed saturation is higher in summer and lower in winter ({cite.6.'Feely_et_al_1988}; {cite.6.'Merico_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Findlay_et_al_2008}). Future projections using ocean carbon cycle models indicate that undersaturated conditions will be reached first in winter ({cite.6.'Orr_et_al_2005}). In the Southern Ocean, it is projected that wintertime undersaturation with respect to aragonite will begin when atmospheric CO2 will reach 450 ppm, within 1-3 decades, which is about 100 ppm sooner (~30 years under the IS92a scenario) than for the annual mean undersaturation ({cite.6.'McNeil_and_Matear_2008}). As well, aragonite undersaturation will be first reached during wintertime in parts (10%) of the Arctic when atmospheric CO2 will reach 410 ppm, within a decade ({cite.6.'Steinacher_et_al_2009}). Then, aragonite undersaturation will become widespread in these regions at atmospheric CO2 levels of 500–600 ppm ({'Figure_6_28 Figure 6.28}).

Although projected changes in pH are generally largest at the surface, the greatest pH changes in the subtropics occur between 200 and 300 m where subsurface increased loads of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 are similar to surface changes but the carbonate buffering capacity is lower ({cite.6.'Orr_2011}). This more intense projected subsurface pH reduction is consistent with the observed subsurface changes in pH in the subtropical North Pacific ({cite.6.'Dore_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Byrne_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Ishii_et_al_2011}). As subsurface saturation states decline, the horizon separating undersaturated waters below from supersaturated waters above is projected to move upward (shoal). By 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario, the median {Glossary.*Projection projection} from 11 CMIP5 models is that this interface (aragonite saturation horizon) will shoal from 200 m up to 40 m in the subarctic Pacific, from 1000 m up to the surface in the Southern Ocean, and from 2850 m to 150 m in the North Atlantic ({'Figure_6_29 Figure 6.29}), consistent with results from previous model comparison ({cite.6.'Orr_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'Orr_2011}). Under the SRES A2 scenario, the volume of ocean with supersaturated waters is projected to decline from 42% in the preindustrial Era to 25% in 2100 ({cite.6.'Steinacher_et_al_2009}). Yet even if atmospheric CO2 does not go above 450 ppm, most of the deep ocean volume is projected to become undersaturated with respect to both aragonite and calcite after several centuries ({cite.6.'Caldeira_and_Wickett_2005}). Nonetheless, the most recent projections under all {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} scenarios but RCP8.5 illustrate that limiting atmospheric CO2 will greatly reduce the level of {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} that will be experienced ({cite.6.'Joos_et_al_2011}).

In the open ocean, future reductions in surface ocean pH and CaCO3 (calcite and aragonite) saturation states are controlled mostly by the invasion of anthropogenic carbon. Other effects due to future climate change counteract less than 10% of the reductions in CaCO3 saturation induced by the invasion of anthropogenic carbon ({cite.6.'Orr_et_al_2005}; {cite.6.'McNeil_and_Matear_2006}; {cite.6.'Cao_et_al_2007}). Warming dominates other effects from climate-change by reducing CO2 solubility and thus by enhancing [CO32–]. An exception is the Arctic Ocean where reductions in pH and CaCO3 saturation states are projected to be exacerbated by effects from increased freshwater input due to {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} melt, more precipitation, and greater air–sea CO2 fluxes due to less sea ice cover ({cite.6.'Steinacher_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Yamamoto_et_al_2012}). The projected effect of freshening is consistent with current observations of lower saturation states and lower pH values near river mouths and in areas under substantial fresh-water influence ({cite.6.'Salisbury_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Chierici_and_Fransson_2009}; Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009).

Regional ocean carbon cycle models project that some nearshore systems are also highly vulnerable to future pH decrease. In the California Current System, an eastern boundary upwelling system, observations and model results show that strong seasonal upwelling of carbonrich waters ({cite.6.'Feely_et_al_2008}) renders surface waters as vulnerable to future ocean acidification as those in the Southern Ocean ({cite.6.'Gruber_et_al_2012}). In the Northwestern European Shelf Seas, large spatiotemporal variability is enhanced by local effects from river input and organic matter degradation, exacerbating acidification from anthropogenic CO2 invasion ({cite.6.'Artioli_et_al_2012}). In the Gulf of Mexico and East China Sea, coastal eutrophication, another anthropogenic perturbation, has been shown to enhance subsurface acidification as additional respired carbon accumulates at depth ({cite.6.'Cai_et_al_2011}).
