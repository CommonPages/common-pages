title: 6.4.5 - Future Ocean Oxygen Depletion

It is very likely that global warming will lead to declines in dissolved O2 in the ocean interior through warming-induced reduction in O2 solubility and increased ocean stratification. This will have implications for nutrient and carbon cycling, ocean productivity and marine habitats ({cite.6.'Keeling_et_al_2010}).

Future changes in dissolved O2 have been investigated using models of various complexity (see references in {'Table_6_13 Table 6.13}). The global ocean dissolved oxygen will decline significantly under future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} ({cite.6.'Cocco_et_al_2013}). Simulated declines in mean dissolved O2 concentration for the global ocean range from 6 to 12 μmol kg–1 by the year 2100 ({'Table_6_13 Table 6.13}), with a {Glossary.*Projection projection} of 3 to 4 μmol kg–1 in one model with low {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (Frölicher et al., 2009). This general {Glossary.*Trend trend} is confirmed by the latest {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} from the CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} models, with reductions in mean dissolved O2 concentrations from 1.5 to 4% (2.5 to 6.5 μmol kg–1) in 2090s relative to 1990s for all {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} ({'Figure_6_30 Figure 6.30}a).

Most modelling studies ({'Table_6_13 Table 6.13}) explain the global decline in dissolved oxygen by enhanced surface ocean stratification leading to reductions in convective mixing and deep water formation and by a contribution of 18 to 50% from ocean warming-induced reduction in solubility. These two effects are in part compensated by a small increase in O2 concentration from projected reductions in biological export production production ({cite.6.'Bopp_et_al_2001}; {cite.6.'Steinacher_et_al_2010}) or changes in {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation} age of the tropical {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} ({cite.6.'Gnanadesikan_et_al_2007}). The largest regional decreases in oxygen concentration (~20 to 100 μmol kg–1) are projected for the intermediate (200 to 400 m) to deep waters of the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean for 2100 ({cite.6.'Plattner_et_al_2002}; {cite.6.'Matear_and_Hirst_2003}; Frölicher et al., 2009; {cite.6.'Matear_et_al_2010}; {cite.6.'Cocco_et_al_2013}), which is confirmed by the latest CMIP5 projections ({'Figure_6_30 Figure 6.30}c and 6.30d).

It is as likely as not that the extent of open-ocean hypoxic (dissolved oxygen <60 to 80 μmol kg–1) and suboxic (dissolved oxygen <5 μmol kg–1) waters will increase in the coming decades. Most models show even some increase in oxygen in most O2-poor waters and thus a slight decrease in the extent of suboxic waters under the SRES-A2 scenario ({cite.6.'Cocco_et_al_2013}), as well as under {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario (see the modelmean increase of sub-surface O2 in large parts of the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans, {'Figure_6_30 Figure 6.30}d). This rise in oxygen in most suboxic waters has been shown to be caused in one model study by an increased supply of oxygen due to lateral diffusion ({cite.6.'Gnanadesikan_et_al_2012}). Given limitations of global ocean models in simulating today’s O2 distribution ({cite.6.'Cocco_et_al_2013}), as well as reproducing the measured changes in O2 concentrations over the past 50 years (see {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}, and {cite.6.'Stramma_et_al_2012}), the model projections are uncertain, especially concerning the evolution of O2 in and around oxygen minimum zones.

A number of biogeochemical ocean {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} feedbacks, not yet included in most marine biogeochemical models (including CMIP5 models, see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5.6_3_2_5_6 Section 6.3.2.5.6}), could also impact future trends of ocean deoxygenation. For example, {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} which include a pCO2sensitive C:N drawdown in primary production, as suggested by some mesocosm experiments ({cite.6.'Riebesell_et_al_2007}), project future increases of up to 50% in the volume of the suboxic waters by 2100 ({cite.6.'Oschlies_et_al_2008}; {cite.6.'Tagliabue_et_al_2011}). In addition, future marine hypoxia could be amplified by changes in the CaCO3 to organic matter ‘rain ratio’ in response to rising pCO2 ({cite.6.'Hofmann_and_Schellnhuber_2009}). Reduction in biogenic calcification due to {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} would weaken the strength of CaCO3 mineral ballasting effect, which could lead organic material to be remineralized at a shallower depth exacerbating the future expansion of shallow hypoxic waters.

The modeled estimates do not take into account processes that are specific to the coastal ocean and may amplify deoxygenation. Recent observations for the period 1976–2000 have shown that dissolved O2 concentrations have declined at a faster rate in the coastal ocean (–0.28 μmol kg–1 yr–1) than the open ocean (–0.02 μmol kg–1 y–1, and a faster rate than in the period 1951–1975, indicating a worsening of hypoxia ({cite.6.'Gilbert_et_al_2010}). Hypoxia in the shallow coastal ocean (apart from continental shelves in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems) is largely eutrophication driven and is controlled by the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} flux of nutrients (N and P) and organic matter from rivers. If continued industrialisation and intensification of agriculture yield larger nutrient loads in the future, eutrophication should intensify ({cite.6.'Rabalais_et_al_2010}), and further increase the coastal ocean deoxygenation.

On longer time scales beyond 2100, ocean deoxygenation is projected to increase with some models simulating a tripling in the volume of suboxic waters by 2500 ({cite.6.'Schmittner_et_al_2008}). Ocean deoxygenation and further expansion of suboxic waters could persist on millennial time scales, with average dissolved O2 concentrations projected to reach minima of up to 56 μmol kg–1 below pre-industrial levels in experiments with high {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and high climate sensitivity ({cite.6.'Shaffer_et_al_2009}).

A potential expansion of hypoxic or suboxic water over large parts of the ocean is likely to impact the marine cycling of important nutrients, particularly nitrogen. The intensification of low oxygen waters has been suggested to lead to increases in water column denitrification and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} emissions (e.g., {cite.6.'Codispoti_2010}; {cite.6.'Naqvi_et_al_2010}). Recent works, however, suggest that oceanic N2O production is dominated by nitrification with a contribution of 7% by denitrification ({cite.6.'Freing_et_al_2012}), {'Figure_6_4 Figure 6.4}c) and that ocean deoxygenation in response to anthropogenic climate change could leave N2O production relatively unchanged ({cite.6.'Bianchi_et_al_2012}).
