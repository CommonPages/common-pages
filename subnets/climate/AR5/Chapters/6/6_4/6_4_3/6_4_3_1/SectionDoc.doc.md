title: 6.4.3.1 - The RCP Future Carbon Dioxide Concentration and Emissions Scenarios

The CMIP5 simulations include four future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways ({Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}; see Glossary) ({cite.6.'Moss_et_al_2010}): {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} (see {Chapters.1 Chapter 1}). These future scenarios include {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration and {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, and have been generated by four Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and are labelled according to the approximate global {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} level at 2100. These scenarios are described in more detail in {Chapters.1 Chapter 1} ({Box_1_1 Box 1.1}) and {Chapters.12.12_3 Section 12.3} and also documented in Annex II. van Vuuren et al. (2011) showed that the basic climate and {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} responses of IAMs is generally consistent with the spread of climate and carbon cycle responses from {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs}. For the physical and biogeochemical components of the RCP scenarios 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, the underlying IAMs are closely related. Only the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) IAM, which created RCP2.6, differs markedly by using a more sophisticated carbon cycle sub-model for land and ocean. The Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change 6 (MAGICC6) simple {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} was subsequently used to generate the CO2 pathway for all four RCP scenarios using the CO2 emissions output by the four IAMs ({cite.6.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011}).
