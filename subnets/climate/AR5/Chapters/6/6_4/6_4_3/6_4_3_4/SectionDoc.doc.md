title: 6.4.3.4 - Permafrost Carbon

Current estimates of {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} soil carbon stocks are ~1700 PgC ({cite.6.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}), the single largest component of the terrestrial carbon pool. Terrestrial carbon models project a land {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Glossary.*Sink sink} with warming at high northern latitudes; however none of the models participating in C4MIP or CMIP5 included explicit representation of permafrost soil carbon decomposition in response to future warming. Including permafrost carbon processes into an {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESM} may change the sign of the high northern latitude {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} response to warming from a sink to a {Glossary.*Source source} ({cite.6.'Koven_et_al_2011}). Overall, there is high confidence that reductions in permafrost extent due to warming will cause thawing of some currently frozen carbon. However, there is low confidence on the magnitude of carbon losses through CO2 and {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. The magnitude of CO2 and CH4 emissions to the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} is assessed to range from 50 to 250 PgC between 2000 and 2100 for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}. The magnitude of the source of CO2 to the atmosphere from decomposition of permafrost carbon in response to warming varies widely according to different techniques and {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. Process models provide different estimates of the cumulative loss of permafrost carbon: 7 to 17 PgC ({cite.6.'Zhuang_et_al_2006}) (not considered in the range given above because it corresponds only to contemporary tundra soil carbon), 55 to 69 Pg ({cite.6.'Koven_et_al_2011}), 126 to 254 PgC ({cite.6.'Schaefer_et_al_2011}) and 68 to 508 PgC ({cite.6.'MacDougall_et_al_2012}) (not considered in the range given above because this estimate is not obtained from a concentration driven, but for emission driven RCP scenario and it is the only study of that type so far). Combining observed vertical soil carbon profiles with modeled thaw rates provides an estimate that the total quantity of newly thawed soil carbon by 2100 will be 246 PgC for RCP4.5 and 436 PgC for RCP8.5 ({cite.6.'Harden_et_al_2012}), although not all of this amount will be released to the atmosphere on that time scale. {Topics.*Uncertainty Uncertainty} estimates suggest the cumulative amount of thawed permafrost carbon could range from 33 to 114 PgC (68% range) under RCP8.5 warming (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2012), or 50 to 270 PgC (5th to 95th percentile range) ({cite.6.'Burke_et_al_2013}).

Sources of uncertainty for the permafrost carbon {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} include the physical thawing rates, the fraction of carbon that is released after being thawed and the time scales of release, possible mitigating nutrient feedbacks and the role of fine-scale processes such as spatial variability in permafrost degradation. It is also uncertain how much thawed carbon will decompose to CO2 or to CH4 (see Sections {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_7 6.4.7}, {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_4 12.5.5.4} and {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_8.12_4_8_1 12.4.8.1}).
