title: 6.4.8.2.4 - Changes in the diffuse fraction of solar radiation at the surface

{cite.6.'Mercado_et_al_2009 Mercado et al. (2009)} estimated that variations in the diffuse fraction, associated largely with the ‘{Glossary.*Global_dimming global dimming}’ period ({cite.6.'Stanhill_and_Cohen_2001}), enhanced the land carbon {Glossary.*Sink sink} by approximately 25% between 1960 and 1999. Under heavily polluted or dark cloudy skies, plant productivity may decline as the diffuse effect is insufficient to offset decreased surface irradiance ({cite.6.'UNEP_2011}). Under future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} involving reductions in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (Figures {'Figure_6_33 6.33} and {'Figure_6_34 6.34}), the diffuse-radiation enhancement of carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} will decline.
