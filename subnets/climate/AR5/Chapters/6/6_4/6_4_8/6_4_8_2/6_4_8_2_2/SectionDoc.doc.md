title: 6.4.8.2.2 - Elevated surface ozone

Plants are known to suffer damage due to exposure to levels of {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} (O3) above about 40 ppb ({cite.6.'Ashmore_2005}). Model simulations of plant O3 damage on the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} have found a reduction in terrestrial carbon storage between 2005 and 2100 ranging from 4 to 140 PgC ({cite.6.'Felzer_et_al_2005}) and up to 260 PgC ({cite.6.'Sitch_et_al_2007}).
