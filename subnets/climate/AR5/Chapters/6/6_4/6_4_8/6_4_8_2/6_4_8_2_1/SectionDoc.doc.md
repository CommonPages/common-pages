title: 6.4.8.2.1 - Phosphorus

On centennial time scales, the phosphoros (P) limitation of terrestrial carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} could become more severe than the nitrogen limitation because of limited phosphorus sources. Model simulations have shown a shift after 2100 from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation at high latitudes ({cite.6.'Goll_et_al_2012}).
