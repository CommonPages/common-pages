title: 6.4.8.2.3 - Iron deposition to oceans

Changes in iron deposition may have affected ocean carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} in the past ({Chapters.6.6_2.6_2_1.6_2_1_1 Section 6.2.1.1}), but future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of iron deposition from desert dust over the ocean are uncertain, even about the sign of changes ({cite.6.'Tegen_et_al_2004}; {cite.6.'Mahowald_et_al_2009}). {cite.6.'Tagliabue_et_al_2008 Tagliabue et al. (2008)} found relatively little impact of varying aeolian iron input on ocean {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fluxes, but {cite.6.'Mahowald_et_al_2011 Mahowald et al. (2011)} show projected changes in ocean productivity as large as those due to CO2 increases and climate change.
