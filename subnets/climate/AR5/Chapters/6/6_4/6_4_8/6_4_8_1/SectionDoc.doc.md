title: 6.4.8.1 - Changes in Fire under Climate Change/Scenarios of Anthropogenic Fire Changes

Regional studies for boreal regions suggest an increase in future fire risk (e.g., {cite.6.'Amiro_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Balshi_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Flannigan_et_al_2009a}; {cite.6.'Spracklen_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Tymstra_et_al_2007}; {cite.6.'Westerling_et_al_2011}; {cite.6.'Wotton_et_al_2010}) with implications for carbon and nutrient storage ({cite.6.'Certini_2005}). {cite.6.'Kurz_et_al_2008b Kurz et al. (2008b)} and {cite.6.'Metsaranta_et_al_2010 Metsaranta et al. (2010)} indicated that increased fire activity has the potential to turn the Canadian {Glossary.*Forest forest} from a {Glossary.*Sink sink} to a {Glossary.*Source source} of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}. Models predict spatially variable responses in fire activity, including strong increases and decreases, due to regional variations in the climate–fire relationship, and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} interference ({cite.6.'Scholze_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Flannigan_et_al_2009b}; {cite.6.'Krawchuk_et_al_2009}; {cite.6.'Pechony_and_Shindell_2010}; {cite.6.'Kloster_et_al_2012}). Wetter conditions can reduce fire activity, but increased {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} availability can increase fire {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({cite.6.'Scholze_et_al_2006}; {cite.6.'Terrier_et_al_2013}). Using a land surface model and future climate {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} from two {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}, {cite.6.'Kloster_et_al_2012 Kloster et al. (2012)} projected fire carbon emissions in 2075–2099 that exceed present-day emissions by 17 to 62% (0.3 to 1.0 PgC yr–1) depending on scenario.

Future fire activity will also depend on anthropogenic factors especially related to {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}. For the Amazon it is estimated that at present 58% of the area is too humid to allow {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation} fires but climate change might reduce this area to 37% by 2050 (Le Page et al., 2010). {cite.6.'Golding_and_Betts_2008 Golding and Betts (2008)} estimated that future Amazon forest vulnerability to fire may depend nonlinearly on combined climate change and deforestation.
