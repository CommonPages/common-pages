title: 6.4.2.2 - Scenario Dependence of Feedbacks

The values of carbon-cycle {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} metrics can vary markedly for different {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} and as such cannot be used to compare model simulations over different time periods, nor to inter-compare model simulations with different scenarios ({cite.6.'Arora_et_al_2013}). {cite.6.'Gregory_et_al_2009 Gregory et al. (2009)} demonstrated how sensitive the feedback metrics are to the rate of change of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} for two models: faster rates of CO2 increase lead to reduced β values as the carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} (especially in the ocean) lags further behind the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. γ is much less sensitive to the scenario, as both global temperature and carbon uptake lag the forcing.
