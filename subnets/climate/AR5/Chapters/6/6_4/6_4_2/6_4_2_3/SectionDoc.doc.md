title: 6.4.2.3 - Regional Feedback Analysis

The linear {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} analysis with the β and γ metrics of {cite.6.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006 Friedlingstein et al. (2006)} has been applied at the regional scale to future carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} by {cite.6.'Roy_et_al_2011 Roy et al. (2011)} and {cite.6.'Yoshikawa_et_al_2008 Yoshikawa et al. (2008)}. {'Figure_6_22 Figure 6.22} shows this analysis extended to land and ocean points for the CMIP5 models under the 1% yr–1 {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} simulations.
