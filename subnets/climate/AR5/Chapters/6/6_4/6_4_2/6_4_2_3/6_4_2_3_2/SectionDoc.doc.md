title: 6.4.2.3.2 - Regional land response

Increased {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} by the CMIP5 models to increase land CO2 sinks everywhere (positive β) (medium confidence). This response, βL, has the largest values over tropical land, in humid rather than arid regions, associated with enhanced carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} in forested areas of already high {Glossary.*Biomass biomass}. In the zonal totals, there is a secondary peak of high βL values over NH temperate and boreal ecosystems, partly due to a greater land area there but also coincident with large areas of {Glossary.*Forest forest}. Models agree on the sign of response but have low agreement on the magnitude.

The climate effect alone is projected by the CMIP5 models to reduce land CO2 sinks in tropics and mid latitudes (negative γ) (medium confidence). CMIP5 models show medium agreement that warming may increase land carbon uptake in high latitudes but none of these models include representation of {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} carbon pools which are projected to decrease in warmer conditions ({Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_3.6_4_3_3 Section 6.4.3.3}); therefore confidence is low regarding the sign and magnitude of future high-latitude land carbon response to climate change. {cite.6.'Matthews_et_al_2005 Matthews et al. (2005)} showed that vegetation productivity is the major cause of C4MIP {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread}, but this manifests itself as changes in soil organic matter ({cite.6.'Jones_and_Falloon_2009}).
