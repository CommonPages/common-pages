title: 6.4.2.3.1 - Regional ocean response

Increased {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} by the CMIP5 models to increase oceanic CO2 sinks almost everywhere (positive β) (high confidence) with the exception of some very limited areas ({'Figure_6_22 Figure 6.22}). The spatial distribution of the CO2 ocean response, βo, is consistent between the models and with the {cite.6.'Roy_et_al_2011 Roy et al. (2011)} analysis. On average, the regions with the strongest increase of oceanic CO2 sinks in response to higher atmospheric CO2 are the North Atlantic and the Southern Oceans. The magnitude and distribution of βo in the ocean closely resemble the distribution of historical {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 flux from inversion studies and forward modelling studies ({cite.6.'Gruber_et_al_2009}), with the dominant anthropogenic CO2 {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} in the Southern Ocean ({Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2.6_3_2_5 Section 6.3.2.5}).

Climate warming is projected by the CMIP5 models to reduce oceanic carbon uptake in most oceanic regions (negative γ) (medium confidence) consistent with the {cite.6.'Roy_et_al_2011 Roy et al. (2011)} analysis ({'Figure_6_22 Figure 6.22}). This sensitivity of ocean CO2 sinks to climate, γo, is mostly negative (i.e., a reduced regional ocean CO2 {Glossary.*Sink sink} in response to climate change) but with regions of positive values in the Arctic, the Antarctic and in the equatorial Pacific (i.e., climate change increases ocean CO2 sink in these regions). The North Atlantic Ocean and the mid-latitude Southern Ocean have the largest negative γo values. Reduced CO2 uptake in response to climate change in the sub-polar Southern Ocean and the tropical regions has been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to warming induced decreased CO2 solubility, reduced CO2 uptake in the mid latitudes to decreased CO2 solubility and decreased {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} formation which reduces the absorption of anthropogenic CO2 in intermediate and deep waters ({cite.6.'Roy_et_al_2011}). Increased uptake in the Arctic Ocean and the polar Southern Ocean is partly associated with a reduction in the fractional {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} coverage ({cite.6.'Roy_et_al_2011}).
