title: 4.7.1 - Background

{Glossary.*Frozen_ground Frozen ground} occurs across the world at high latitudes, in mountain regions, beneath glacial ice and beneath lakes and seas. It is a product of cold weather and climate, and can be diurnal, seasonal or perennial. Wherever the ground remains at or below 0Â°C for at least two consecutive years, it is called {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} (Van Everdingen, 1998), and this too can occur beneath the land surface (terrestrial permafrost) and beneath the seafloor (subsea permafrost). In this chapter, the term permafrost refers to terrestrial permafrost unless specified.

Both the temperature and extent of permafrost are highly sensitive to climate change, but the responses may be complex and highly heterogeneous (e.g., {cite.4.'Osterkamp_2007}). Similarly, the annual freezing and thawing of {Glossary.*Seasonally_frozen_ground seasonally frozen ground} is coupled to the land surface energy and moisture fluxes, and thus to climate. Since, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, can contain significant fractions of ice, changes in landscapes, ecosystems and hydrological processes can occur when it forms or degrades ({cite.4.'Jorgenson_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Gruber_and_Haeberli_2007}; {cite.4.'White_et_al_2007}). Furthermore, frozen organic soils contain considerable quantities of carbon, more than twice the amount currently in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.4.'Tarnocai_et_al_2009}), and permafrost thawing exposes previously frozen carbon to microbial degradation and releases radiatively active gases, such as carbon dioxide ({Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}) and methane ({Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}), into the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} ({cite.4.'Zimov_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Schuur_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Schaefer_et_al_2011}) (for a detailed assessment of this issue, see {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}). Similarly, recent evidence suggests that degradation of permafrost may also permit the release of nitrous oxide ({Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}), which is also radiatively active ({cite.4.'Repo_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Marushchak_et_al_2011}). Finally, permafrost degradation may directly affect the lives of people, both in northern and high-mountain areas, through impacts on the landscape, vegetation and infrastructure (WGII, Chapter 28).
