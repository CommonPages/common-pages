title: 4.7.3 - Subsea Permafrost
section 4_7_3

  |Subsea {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} is similar to its terrestrial counterpart, but lies beneath the coastal seas. Observations of gas release on the East Siberian Shelf and high methane concentrations in water-column and air above have led to the suggestion that permafrost thawing creates pathways for gas release. Degradation rates are discussed in this section.
