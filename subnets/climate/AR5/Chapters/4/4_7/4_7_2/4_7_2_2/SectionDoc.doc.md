title: 4.7.2.2 - Permafrost Degradation

{Glossary.*Permafrost Permafrost} degradation refers to a decrease in thickness and/or areal extent. In particular, the degradation can be manifested by a deepening of summer thaw, or top-down or bottom-up permafrost thawing, and a development of taliks (see Glossary). Other manifestations of degradation include geomorphologic changes such as the formation of {Glossary.*Thermokarst thermokarst} terrain (see Glossary and {cite.4.'Jorgenson_et_al_2006}), expansion of thaw lakes ({cite.4.'Sannel_and_Kuhry_2011}) active-layer detachment slides along slopes, rock falls ({cite.4.'Ravanel_et_al_2010}), and destabilized rock glaciers (Kääb et al., 1997; {cite.4.'Haeberli_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Haeberli_et_al_2010}). Although most permafrost has been degrading since the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age Little Ice Age} ({cite.4.'Halsey_et_al_1995}), the {Glossary.*Trend trend} was relatively modest until the past two decades, during which the rate of degradation has increased in some regions ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010b}).

Significant permafrost degradation has been reported in the Russian European North (medium confidence). Warm permafrost with a thickness of 10 to 15 m thawed completely in the period 1975–2005 in the Vorkuta area (Oberman, 2008). And although boundaries between permafrost types are not easy to map, the southern permafrost boundary in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} is reported to have moved north by about 80 km and the boundary of continuous permafrost has moved north by 15 to 50 km (Oberman, 2008) (medium confidence). Taliks have also developed in relatively thick permafrost during the past several decades. In the Vorkuta region, the thickness of existing closed taliks increased by 0.6 to 6.7 m over the past 30 years ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010b}). Permafrost thawing and {Glossary.*Talik talik} formation has occurred in the Nadym and Urengoy regions in northwestern Russian ({cite.4.'Drozdov_et_al_2010}). Long-term permafrost thawing has been reported around the city of Yakutsk, but this in this case, the thawing may have been caused mainly by {Glossary.*Forest forest} fires or human disturbance (Fedorov and Konstantinov, 2008). Permafrost degradation has also been reported on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau ({cite.4.'Cheng_and_Wu_2007}; {cite.4.'Li_et_al_2008}).

Coastal erosion and permafrost degradation appear to be evident along many Arctic coasts in recent years, with complex interactions between them ({cite.4.'Jones_et_al_2009}). In part, these interactions arise from the thermal and chemical impact of sea water on cold terrestrial permafrost ({cite.4.'Rachold_et_al_2007}). Similar impacts arise for permafrost beneath new thaw lakes, which have been formed in recent years (e.g., {cite.4.'Sannel_and_Kuhry_2011}). In northern Alaska, estimates of permafrost thawing under thaw lakes are in the range 0.9 to 1.7 cm a–1 ({cite.4.'Ling_and_Zhang_2003}).

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, destabilized rock glaciers have received increased attention from researchers. A rock {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} is a mass of perennially frozen rock fragments on a slope, that contains ice in one or more forms and shows evidence of past or present movement (Van Everdingen, 1998; {cite.4.'Haeberli_et_al_2006}). Time series acquired over recent decades by terrestrial surveys indicate acceleration of some rock glaciers as well as seasonal velocity changes related to ground temperatures ({cite.4.'Bodin_et_al_2009};

Noetzli and Vonder Muehll, 2010; {cite.4.'Schoeneich_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Delaloye_et_al_2011}). Similarly, photo-comparison and photogrammetry have indicated collapse-like features on some rock glaciers (Roer et al., 2008). The clear relationship between mean annual air temperature at the rock glacier front and rock glacier velocity points to a likely temperature influence and a plausible causal connection to climate (Kaab et al., 2007). Strong surface lowering of rock glaciers has been reported in the Andes ({cite.4.'Bodin_et_al_2010}), indicating melting of ground ice in rock glaciers and permafrost degradation.
