title: 4.7.2.1 - Permafrost Temperature

The ice content and temperature of permafrost are the key parameters that determine its physical state. {Glossary.*Permafrost Permafrost} temperature is a key parameter used to document changes to permafrost. Permafrost temperature measured at a depth where seasonal variations cease to occur is generally used as an indicator of long-term change and to represent the mean annual ground temperature ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}). For most sites this depth occurs in the upper 20 m.

In the SH, permafrost temperatures as low as –23.6°C have been observed in the Antarctic ({cite.4.'Vieira_et_al_2010}), but in the NH, permafrost temperatures generally range from –15°C to close to the freezing point ({'Figure_4_22 Figure 4.22}) ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}). They are usually coldest in high Arctic regions and gradually increase southwards, but substantial differences do occur at the same latitude. For example, as a result of the proximity to warm ocean currents, the southern limit of permafrost is farther north, and permafrost temperature is higher in Scandinavia and north-western Russia than it is in Arctic regions of Siberia and North America ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}).

In Russia, permafrost temperature measurements reach back to the early 1930s ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010b}), in North America to the late 1940s ({cite.4.'Brewer_1958}) and in China to the early 1960s ({cite.4.'Zhou_et_al_2000}; {cite.4.'Zhao_et_al_2010}). Systematic measurements, however, began mostly in the late 1970s and early 1980s ({cite.4.'Zhou_et_al_2000}; {cite.4.'Osterkamp_2007}; {cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}). In addition, since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, considerable effort (especially during the International Polar Year) has gone into enhancing the observation network and establishing a baseline against which future changes in permafrost can be measured ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}). However, it should be noted that there still exist comparatively few measurements of permafrost temperature in the SH ({cite.4.'Vieira_et_al_2010}).

In most regions, and at most sites, permafrost temperatures have increased during the past three decades (high confidence): at rather fewer sites, permafrost temperatures show little change, or a slight decrease ({'Figure_4_22 Figure 4.22}; {'Table_4_8 Table 4.8}). However, it is important to discriminate between cold permafrost, with mean annual ground temperatures below –2°C, and warm permafrost at temperatures above –2°C ({cite.4.'Cheng_and_Wu_2007}; {cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Wu_and_Zhang_2010}). Warm permafrost is found mostly in the discontinuous permafrost zone, while cold permafrost exists in the continuous permafrost zone and only occasionally in the discontinuous permafrost zone ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}).

{table:'Table_4_8}

Overall, permafrost temperature increases are greater in cold permafrost than they are in warm permafrost (high confidence). This is especially true for warm ice-rich permafrost, due to heat absorbed by partial melting of interstitial ice, slowing and attenuating temperature change ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}). The temperatures of cold permafrost across a range of regions have increased by up to 2°C since the 1970s ({'Table_4_8 Table 4.8} and {cite.4.'Callaghan_et_al_2011}); however, the timing of warming events has shown considerable spatial variability ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}).

Temperatures of warm permafrost have also increased over the last three decades, but generally by less than 1°C. Warm permafrost is sometimes nearly isothermal with depth; as is observed in mountain regions such as the European Alps (Noetzli and Vonder Muehll, 2010), Scandinavia ({cite.4.'Christiansen_et_al_2010}), the Western Cordillera of North America ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Lewkowicz_et_al_2011}), the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau ({cite.4.'Zhao_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Wu_et_al_2012}) and in the northern high latitudes in the southern margins of discontinuous permafrost regions ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010b}; {cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}). In such areas, permafrost temperatures have shown little or no change, indicating that permafrost is thawing internally but remaining very close to the melting point ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}). Cooling of permafrost due to atmospheric temperature fluctuations has been observed; for example, in the eastern Canadian Arctic until the mid-1990s ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}); but some examples have been short-lived and others controlled by site-specific conditions ({cite.4.'Marchenko_et_al_2007}; {cite.4.'Wu_and_Zhang_2008}; Noetzli and Vonder Muehll, 2010; {cite.4.'Zhao_et_al_2010}). In at least one case in the Antarctic, permafrost warming has been observed in a {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} with almost stable air temperatures ({cite.4.'Guglielmin_and_Cannone_2012}).

Permafrost warming is mainly in response to increased air temperature and changing snow cover (see {Box_4_1 Box 4.1}). In cold permafrost regions, especially in tundra regions with low ice content (such as bedrock) where permafrost warming rates have been greatest, changes in snow cover may play an important role ({cite.4.'Zhang_2005}; {cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}).

In forested areas, especially in warm ice-rich permafrost, changes in permafrost temperature are reduced by the effects of the surface insulation ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Throop_et_al_2012}) and latent heat ({cite.4.'Romanovsky_et_al_2010a}).
