title: 4.7.4.2 - Changes in Seasonally Frozen Ground in Areas Not Underlain by Permafrost

An estimate based on monthly mean soil temperatures from 387 stations across part of the Eurasian continent suggested that the thickness of seasonally {Glossary.*Frozen_ground frozen ground} decreased by about 0.32 m during the period 1930â€“2000 (high confidence, {'Figure_4_24 Figure 4.24}) ({cite.4.'Frauenfeld_and_Zhang_2011}). Inter-decadal variability was such that no {Glossary.*Trend trend} could be identified until the late 1960s, after which seasonal freeze depths decreased significantly until the early 1990s. From then, until about 2008, no further change was evident. Such changes are closely linked with the freezing index, but also with mean annual air temperatures and snow depth ({cite.4.'Frauenfeld_and_Zhang_2011}).

Thickness of {Glossary.*Seasonally_frozen_ground seasonally frozen ground} in western China decreased by 20 to 40 cm since the early 1960s ({cite.4.'Li_et_al_2008}), whereas on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau, the seasonally frozen depth decreased by up to 33 cm since the middle of 1980s ({cite.4.'Li_et_al_2009}). Evidence from the satellite record indicates that the onset dates of spring thaw advanced by 14 days, whereas the autumn freeze date was delayed by 10 days on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau from 1988 through 2007 ({cite.4.'Li_et_al_2012b})
