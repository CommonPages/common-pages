title: 4.7.4 - Changes in Seasonally Frozen Ground

Seasonally {Glossary.*Frozen_ground frozen ground} is a soil layer that freezes and thaws annually, which may or may not overlie terrestrial {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost}, and also includes some portions of the Arctic seabed that freeze in winter. A key parameter regarding {Glossary.*Seasonally_frozen_ground seasonally frozen ground} overlying permafrost is the active-layer thickness (ALT; see Glossary), which indicates the depth of the seasonal freezeâ€“thaw cycle, and which is dependent on climate and other factors; for example, vegetation cover ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2009}). Many observations across many regions have revealed trends in the thickness of the active laver (high confidence).
