title: 4.7.4.1 - Changes in Active-Layer Thickness

Many observations have revealed a general positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the thickness of the {Glossary.*Active_layer active layer} (see Glossary) for discontinuous permafrost regions at high latitudes (medium confidence). Based on measurements from the International {Glossary.*Permafrost Permafrost} Association (IPA) Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) programme, active-layer thickening has been observed since the 1970s and has accelerated since 1995 in northern Europe ({cite.4.'Akerman_and_Johansson_2008}; {cite.4.'Callaghan_et_al_2010}), and on Svalbard and Greenland since the late-1990s ({cite.4.'Christiansen_et_al_2010}). The ALT has increased significantly in the Russian European North ({cite.4.'Mazhitova_2008}), East Siberia (Fyodorov-Davydov et al., 2008), and Chukotka (Zamolodchikov, 2008) since the mid-1990s. {cite.4.'Burn_and_Kokelj_2009 Burn and Kokelj (2009)} found, for a site in the Mackenzie Delta area, that ALT increased by 8 cm between 1983 and 2008, although the record does exhibit high interannual variability as has been observed at other sites in the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2009}). ALT has increased since the mid1990s in the eastern portion of the Canadian Arctic, with the largest increase occurring at bedrock sites in the discontinuous permafrost zone ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2010}).

The interannual variations and trends of the active-layer thickness in Northern America, Northern Europe and Northern Asia from 1990 to 2012 are presented in {'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}. Large regional variations in the yearly variability patterns and trends are apparent. While increases in ALT are occurring in the Eastern Canadian Region ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2009}), a slightly declining trend is observed in the Western Canadian Region ({'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}a). In Northern Europe, the trends in the study areas are similar and consistently positive ({'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}b). On the other hand, in Northern Asia, trends are generally strongly positive with the exception of West Siberia, where the trend is slightly negative ({'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}c). On the interior of Alaska, slightly increasing ALT from 1990 to 2010 was followed by anomalous increases in 2011 and in 2012. Overall, a general increase in ALT since the 1990s has been observed at many stations in many regions (medium confidence). The general increase is shown in {'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}d, which shows the results of analysis of data from about 44 stations in Russia indicating a change of almost 0.2 m from 1950 to 2008.

At some measurement sites on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau, ALT was reported to be increasing at 7.8 cm yr–1 over a period from 1995 through 2010 ({cite.4.'Wu_and_Zhang_2010}). The high rates may have been the result of local disturbances since more recent studies indicate rates of 1.33 cm yr–1 for the period 1981–2010 and 3.6 cm yr–1 for the period 1998–2010 (e.g., {cite.4.'Zhao_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Li_et_al_2012a}).

During the past decade, increases in ALT up to 4.0 cm yr–1 were observed in Mongolian sites characterized as a warm permafrost region ({cite.4.'Sharkhuu_et_al_2007}). Changes in ALT were also detected in Tian Shan ({cite.4.'Marchenko_et_al_2007}; {cite.4.'Zhao_et_al_2010}), and in the European Alps, where increases in ALT were largest during years of hot summers but a strong dependence on surface and subsurface characteristics was noted (Noetzli and Vonder Muehll, 2010).

In several areas, across North America and in West Siberia, large-inter annual variations obscure any trends in ALT (high confidence, {'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}). No trend in ALT was observed on the Alaskan North Slope from 1993 to 2010 (Streletskiy et al., 2008; {cite.4.'Shiklomanov_et_al_2010}) and also in the Mackenzie Valley ({cite.4.'Smith_et_al_2009}) and in West Siberia (Vasiliev et al., 2008) since the mid-1990s ({'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}). At some sites, such as at Western Canada (C5) and Western Siberia (R1) ({'Figure_4_23 Figure 4.23}), the active layer thickness was actually decreasing.

The penetration of thaw into ice-rich permafrost at the base of the active layer is often accompanied by loss of volume due to consolidation. At several sites, this has been shown to cause surface subsidence (medium confidence). Results from ground-based measurements at selected sites on the North Slope of Alaska indicate 11 to 13 cm in surface subsidence over the period 2001–2006 (Streletskiy et al., 2008), 4 to 10 cm from 2003 to 2005 in the Brooks Range ({cite.4.'Overduin_and_Kane_2006}) and up to 20 cm in the Russian European North ({cite.4.'Mazhitova_and_Kaverin_2007}). Subsidence has also been identified using space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. Surface deformation was detected using InSAR over permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska during the 1992–2000 thaw seasons and a long-term surface subsidence of 1 to 4 cm per decade ({cite.4.'Liu_et_al_2010}). Such subsidence could explain why in situ measurements at some locations reveal negligible trends in ALT changes during the past two decades, despite the fact that atmospheric and permafrost temperatures increased during that time.
