title: 4.2.3.3 - Antarctic Sea Ice Drift

Using a 19-year data set (1992–2010) of satellite-tracked {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} motion, {cite.4.'Holland_and_Kwok_2012 Holland and Kwok (2012)} found large and statistically significant decadal trends in Antarctic ice drift that in most sectors are caused by changes in local winds. These trends suggest acceleration of the wind-driven Ross {Glossary.*Gyre Gyre} and deceleration of the Weddell Gyre. The changes in meridional ice transport affect the freshwater budget near the Antarctic coast. This is consistent with the increase of 30,000 km2 yr–1 in the net area export of sea ice from the Ross Sea shelf coastal polynya {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} between 1992 and 2008 ({cite.4.'Comiso_et_al_2011}). Assuming an annual average thickness of 0.6 m, {cite.4.'Comiso_et_al_2011 Comiso et al. (2011)} estimated an increase in volume export of 20 km3 yr–1 which is similar to the rate of production in the Ross Sea coastal polynya region for the same period discussed in {Chapters.4.4_2.4_2_3.4_2_3_5 Section 4.2.3.5}
