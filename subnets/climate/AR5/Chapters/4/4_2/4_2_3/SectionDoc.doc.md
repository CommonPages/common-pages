title: 4.2.3 - Antarctic Sea Ice

The Antarctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} cover is largely seasonal, with average extent varying from a minimum of about 3 × 106 km2 in February to a maximum of about 18 × 106 km2 in September ({cite.4.'Zwally_et_al_2002a}; {cite.4.'Comiso_et_al_2011}). The relatively small fraction of Antarctic sea ice that survives the summer is found mostly in the Weddell Sea, but with some perennial ice also surviving on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and in small patches around the coast. As well as being mostly first-year ice, Antarctic sea ice is also on average thinner, warmer, more saline and more mobile than Arctic ice ({cite.4.'Wadhams_and_Comiso_1992}). These characteristics, which reduce the capabilities of some remote sensing techniques, together with its more distant location from inhabited continents, result in far less being known about the properties of Antarctic sea ice than of that in the Arctic.
