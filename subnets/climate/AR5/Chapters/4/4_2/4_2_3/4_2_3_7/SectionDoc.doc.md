title: 4.2.3.7 - Decadal Trends in Antarctic Sea Ice

For the Antarctic, any changes in many {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} characteristics are unknown. There has been a small but significant increase in total annual mean sea ice extent that is very likely in the range of 1.2 to 1.8 % per decade between 1979 and 2012 (0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade) (very high confidence). There was also a greater increase in ice area associated with an increase in ice concentration. But there are strong regional differences within this total, with some regions increasing in extent/area and some decreasing (high confidence). Similarly, there are contrasting regions around the Antarctic where the ice-free season has lengthened, and others where it has decreased over the satellite period (high confidence). There are still inadequate data to make any assessment of changes to Antarctic sea ice thickness and volume.
