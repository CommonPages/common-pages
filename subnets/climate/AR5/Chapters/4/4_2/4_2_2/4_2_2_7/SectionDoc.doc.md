title: 4.2.2.7 - Arctic Polynyas

High {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} production in coastal polynyas (anomalous regions of open water or low ice concentration) over the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean is responsible for the formation of cold saline water, which contributes to the maintenance of the Arctic Ocean {Glossary.*Halocline halocline} (see Glossary). A new passive microwave algorithm has been used to estimate thin sea ice thicknesses (<0.15 m) in the Arctic Ocean ({cite.4.'Tamura_and_Ohshima_2011}), providing the first circumpolar mapping of sea ice production in coastal polynyas. High sea ice production is confined to the most persistent Arctic coastal polynyas, with the highest ice production rate being in the North Water Polynya. The mean annual sea ice production in the 10 major Arctic polynyas is estimated to be 2942 Â± 373 km3 and decreased by 462 km3 between 1992 and 2007 ({cite.4.'Tamura_and_Ohshima_2011}).
