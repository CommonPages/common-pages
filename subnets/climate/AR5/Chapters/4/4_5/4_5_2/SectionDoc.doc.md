By blending in situ and satellite records, {cite.4.'Brown_and_Robinson_2011 Brown and Robinson (2011)} have updated a key indicator of climate change, namely the time series of NH SCE ({'Figure_4_19 Figure 4.19}). This time series shows significant reductions over the past 90 years with most of the reductions occurring in the 1980s, and is an improvement over that presented in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} in several ways, not least because the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} estimates are explicitly derived through the statistical analysis of multiple data sets, which leads to very high confidence. Snow cover decreases are largest in spring ({'Table_4_7 Table 4.7}), and the rate of decrease increases with latitude in response to larger {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} feedbacks (Déry and Brown, 2007). Averaged March and April NH SCE decreased 0.8% [0.5 to 1.1%] per decade over the 1922–2012 period, 1.6% [0.8 to 2.4%] per decade over the 1967–2012 period, and 2.2% [1.1 to 3.4%] per decade over the 1979–2012 period. In a new development since AR4, both absolute and relative losses in June SCE now exceed the losses in March–April SCE: 11.7% [8.8 to 14.6%] per decade or 53% [40 to 66%] total over the 1967–2012 period and 14.8% [10.3 to 19.3%] per decade over the 1979–2012 period (all ranges very likely). Note that these percentages differ from those given by {cite.4.'Brown_and_Robinson_2011 Brown and Robinson (2011)} which were calculated relative to the mean over the 1979–2000 period, rather than relative to the starting point. The loss rate of June SCE exceeds the loss rate for Coupled {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of June SCE and also exceeds the well-known loss of September {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} extent ({cite.4.'Derksen_and_Brown_2012}). Viewed another way, the NOAA SCE data indicate that, owing to earlier spring snowmelt, the duration of the snow season averaged over NH grid points declined by 5.3 days per decade since winter 1972–1973 ({cite.4.'Choi_et_al_2010}).

Over Eurasia, in situ data show significant increases in winter snow {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} but a shorter snowmelt season ({cite.4.'Bulygina_et_al_2009}). From analysis of passive microwave satellite data since 1979, significant trends toward a shortening of the snowmelt season have been identified over much of Eurasia ({cite.4.'Takala_et_al_2009}) and the pan-Arctic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.4.'Tedesco_et_al_2009}), with a {Glossary.*Trend trend} toward earlier melt of about 5 days per decade for the beginning of the melt season, and a trend of about 10 days per decade later for the end of the melt season.

The correlation between spring temperature and SCE ({'Figure_4_20 Figure 4.20}) demonstrates that trends in spring SCE are linked to rising temperature, and for a well-understood reason: The spring snow cover-albedo {Glossary.*Feedback feedback}. This feedback contributes substantially to the hemispheric response to rising greenhouse gases and provides a useful test of global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.4.'Fernandes_et_al_2009}) (see also {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}). Indeed, the observed declines in land snow cover and sea ice have contributed roughly the same amount to changes in the surface energy fluxes, and the albedo feedback of the NH {Topics.*Climate_System cryosphere} is likely in the range 0.3 to 1.1 W m–2 K–1 ({cite.4.'Flanner_et_al_2011}). {cite.4.'Brown_et_al_2010 Brown et al. (2010)} used satellite, reanalyses and in situ observations to document variability and trend in Arctic spring (May–June) SCE over the 1967–2008 period. In June, with Arctic albedo feedback at a maximum, SCE decreased 46% (as of 2012, now 53%) and air temperature explains 56% of the variability.

For the SH, as noted above (see {Chapters.4.4_5.4_5_1 Section 4.5.1}), there are no correspondingly long visible-wavelength satellite records, but microwave data date from 1979. {cite.4.'Foster_et_al_2009 Foster et al. (2009)} presented the first satellite study of variability and trends in any measure of snow for South America, in this case {Glossary.*Snow_water_equivalent SWE} from microwave data. They focused on the May-September period and noted large year-to-year variability and some lower frequency variability—the July with most extensive snow cover had almost six times as much as the July with the least extensive snow cover—but identified no trends.
