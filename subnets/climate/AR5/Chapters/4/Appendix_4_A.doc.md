title: Appendix 4.A - Appendix 4s.A: Details of Available and Selected Ice Sheet Mass Balance Estimates from 1992 to 2012

All comprehensive mass balance estimates available for Greenland, and the subset of those selected for this assessment ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2 Section 4.4.2}) are listed in Tables 4.A.1 and 4.A.2. Those available for Antarctica are shown in Tables 4.A.3 and 4.A.4. These studies include estimates made from satellite gravimetry (GRACE), satellite {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} (radar and laser) and the mass balance (flux) method. The studies selected for this assessment are the latest made by different research groups, for each of Greenland and Antarctica. The tables indicate whether smaller glaciers peripheral to the {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} are included, or excluded, in the estimate, and explain why some studies were not selected (e.g., earlier estimates from the same researchers have been updated by more recent analyses using extended data).
