section 4_3_2_1

  |Globally coordinated observations of {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} lengths were started in 1894, providing one of the longest available time series of environmental change. More recently, particularly in regions that are difficult to access, aerial photography and satellite imaging have been used to determine glacier length changes over the past decades.
