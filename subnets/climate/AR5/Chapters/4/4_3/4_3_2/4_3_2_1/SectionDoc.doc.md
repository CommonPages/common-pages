title: 4.3.2.1 - Length Change Measurements

For the approximately 500 glaciers worldwide that are regularly observed, front variations (commonly called length changes) are usually obtained through annual measurements of the {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} terminus position. Globally coordinated observations were started in 1894, providing one of the longest available time series of environmental change ({cite.4.'WGMS_2008}). More recently, particularly in regions that are difficult to access, aerial photography and satellite imaging have been used to determine glacier length changes over the past decades. For selected glaciers globally, historic terminus positions have been reconstructed from maps, photographs, satellite imagery, also paintings, dated moraines and other sources (e.g., {cite.4.'Masiokas_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Lopez_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Nussbaumer_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Davies_and_Glasser_2012}; {cite.4.'Leclercq_and_Oerlemans_2012}; {cite.4.'Rabatel_et_al_2013}). Early reconstructions are sparsely distributed in both space and time, generally at intervals of decades. The terminus fluctuations of some individual glaciers have been reconstructed for periods of more than 3000 years ({cite.4.'Holzhauser_et_al_2005}), with a much larger number of records available as far back as the 16th or 17th centuries ({cite.4.'Zemp_et_al_2011}, and references therein). The reconstructed glacier length records are globally well distributed and were used, for example, to determine the contribution of glaciers to global {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise ({cite.4.'Leclercq_et_al_2011}) ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_4 Section 4.3.3.4}), and for an independent temperature {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} at a hemispheric scale ({cite.4.'Leclercq_and_Oerlemans_2012}).
