title: 4.3.2 - Methods to Measure Changes in Glacier Length, Area and Volume/Mass

To measure changes in {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} length, area, mass and volume, a wide range of observational techniques has been developed. Each technique has individual benefits over specific {Glossary.*Spatial_and_temporal_scales spatial and temporal scales}; their main characteristics are summarized in {'Table_4_3 Table 4.3}. Monitoring programs include complex climate-related observations at a few glaciers, index measurements of mass balance at about a hundred glaciers, annual length changes for a few hundred glaciers, and repeat geodetic estimates of area and volume changes at regional scales using remote sensing methods (e.g., {cite.4.'Haeberli_et_al_2007}). Although in situ measurements of glacier changes are biased towards glaciers that are easily accessible, comparatively small and simple to interpret, a large proportion of all glaciers in the world is debris covered or tidewater {Glossary.*Calving calving} (see {'Table_4_2 Table 4.2}) and changes of such glaciers are more difficult to interpret in climatic terms ({cite.4.'Yde_and_Pasche_2010}). In addition, many of the remote-sensing based assessments do not discriminate these types.
