title: 4.3.2.2 - Area Change Measurements

{Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} area changes are reported in increasing number and coverage based on repeat satellite imagery ({cite.4.'WGMS_2008}). Although satellite-based observations are available only for the past four decades, studies using aerial photography, old maps, as well as mapped and dated moraines and trim lines show glacier areas back to the end of the so-called Little Ice Age ({Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA}, see Glossary) about 150 years ago (cf. Figure 6 in {cite.4.'Rabatel_et_al_2008}) and beyond (e.g., {cite.4.'Citterio_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Davies_and_Glasser_2012}). The observed area changes depend (in most regions) on glacier size (with smaller glaciers shrinking at faster percentage rates) and tend to vary greatly within any one mountain range. Moreover, the time spans of the measurements of change vary from study to study and regional or global-scale estimates are therefore difficult to generate. The focus here is thus on the comparison of mean annual relative area changes averaged over entire mountain regions.
