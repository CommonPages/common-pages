title: 4.3.2.3 - Volume and Mass Change Measurements

Several methods are in use for measuring mass changes of glaciers. Traditionally, the annual surface mass balance is derived from repeated snow density and snow/ice stake readings on individual glaciers. Estimates over larger regions are obtained by extrapolating from the measured glaciers. This labour-intensive method is generally restricted to a limited number of accessible glaciers, which are unevenly distributed over {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} regions and types. Annual measurements began in the 1940s on a few glaciers, with about 100 glaciers being measured since the 1980sâ€”and only 37 glaciers have been measured without interruption for more than 40 years ({cite.4.'WGMS_2009}). Potential mass loss from {Glossary.*Calving calving} or from basal ablation is not included in the surface measurements. At present, it is not possible to quantify all sources of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in mass budgets extrapolated from measurements of individual glaciers ({cite.4.'Cogley_2009b}).

A second method determines the volume change of all glaciers in a {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} by measurement of surface-elevation changes ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_3 Section 4.3.3.3} and {'Figure_4_11 Figure 4.11}). The information is derived by subtracting digital terrain models from two points in time, including those from repeat airborne or satellite {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} (particularly suitable for larger and flatter ice surfaces). The conversion from volume to mass change can cause a major uncertainty, in particular over short periods, as density information is required, but is generally available only from field measurements ({cite.4.'Gardner_et_al_2013}, and references therein).

Since 2003, a third method used to estimate overall mass change is through measurement of the changing gravity field from satellites (GRACE mission). The coarse spatial {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} (about 300 km) and the difficulties of separating different mass change signals such as hydrological storage and glacial {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} adjustment limit this method to regions with large continuous ice extent ({cite.4.'Gardner_et_al_2013}).

A fourth method calculates the mass balance of individual glaciers, or a glacier region, with models that either convert particular glacier variables such as length changes or the altitude of the {Glossary.*Equilibrium_line equilibrium line} (see Glossary) (e.g., {cite.4.'Rabatel_et_al_2005}; {cite.4.'Luethi_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Leclercq_et_al_2011}) into mass changes, or use time series of atmospheric temperature and other meteorological variables to simulate glacier mass balances at different levels of complexity (e.g., {cite.4.'Hock_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Machguth_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Marzeion_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Hirabayashi_et_al_2013}). The models improve fidelity and physical completeness, and add value to the scarce direct measurements.

A fifth method determines glacier mass changes as residuals of the water balance for hydrological basins rather than for glacier regions. Results from all but this last method are used in the following regional and global assessment of glacier mass changes (Sections {Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_3 4.3.3.3} and {Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_4 4.3.3.4}).
