Despite their variability due to different response times and local conditions (see {FAQ_4_2 FAQ 4.2}), the annually measured {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} terminus fluctuations from about 500 glaciers worldwide reveal a largely homogeneous {Glossary.*Trend trend} of retreat ({cite.4.'WGMS_2008}). In {'Figure_4_9 Figure 4.9}, a selection of the available long-term records of field measurements is shown for 14 out of the 19 RGI regions. Cumulative values of retreat for large, land-terminating valley glaciers typically reach a few kilometres over the 120year period of observation. For mid-latitude mountain and valley glaciers, typical retreat rates are of the order of 5 to 20 m yr–1. Rates of up to 100 m yr–1 (or even more) are seen to occur under special conditions, such as the complete loss of a tongue on a steep slope (see {FAQ_4_2 FAQ 4.2}, {'FAQ_4_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}c), or the disintegration of a very flat tongue. A non-{Glossary.*Calving calving} valley glacier in Chile had reported mean annual retreat rates of 125 m from 1961 to 2011 ({cite.4.'Rivera_et_al_2012}). The general tendency of retreat in the 20th century was interrupted in several regions (e.g., regions 2, 8, 11 and 17) by phases of stability lasting one or two decades, or even advance, for example in the 1920s, 1970s and 1990s (regionally variable). In regions for which long-term field measurements of several glaciers of different sizes are available, the terminus fluctuations typically show a pattern with the largest (flatter) glaciers tending to retreat continuously and by large cumulative distances, medium-sized (steeper) glaciers showing decadal fluctuations, and smaller glaciers showing high variability superimposed on smaller cumulative retreats ({'Figure_4_9 Figure 4.9}).

The exceptional terminus advances of a few individual glaciers in Scandinavia and New Zealand in the 1990s may be related to locally specific climatic conditions such as increased winter precipitation ({cite.4.'Nesje_et_al_2000}; {cite.4.'Chinn_et_al_2005}; {cite.4.'Lemke_et_al_2007}). In other regions, such as Iceland, the Karakoram and Svalbard, observed advances were often related to dynamical instabilities (surging) of glaciers (e.g., {cite.4.'Murray_et_al_2003}; {cite.4.'Quincey_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Bolch_et_al_2012}; Björnsson et al., 2013). Glaciers with calving instabilities can retreat exceptionally rapidly ({cite.4.'Pfeffer_2007}), while those with heavily debris-covered tongues are often close to stationary ({cite.4.'Scherler_et_al_2011}). More regionally focused studies of length change over different time periods (e.g., {cite.4.'Citterio_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Masiokas_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Lopez_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Bolch_et_al_2012}) justify high confidence about the trend of glacier length variations shown in {'Figure_4_9 Figure 4.9}.
