title: 4.3.3.2 - Area Changes

From the large number of published studies on {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} area changes in all parts of the world since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (see Table 4.SM.1) a selection with examples from 16 out of the 19 RGI regions is shown in {'Figure_4_10 Figure 4.10}. The studies reveal that (1) total glacier area has decreased in all regions, (2) the rates of change cover a similar range of values in all regions, (3) there is considerable variability of the rates of change within each {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, (4) highest loss rates are found in regions 2, 11 and 16, and (5) the rates of loss have a tendency to be higher over more recent time periods. The last point (5) requires studies comparing the same sample of glaciers over multiple similar time periods. For 14 out of 19 regions listed in Table 4.SM.1 (see Supplementary Material) with such an analysis, higher loss rates were found for the more recent period.

While points (1) and (2) give high confidence in the global-scale shrinkage in glacier area, (3) points to a considerable regional to local-scale scatter of observed change rates. The shorter the period of investigation and the smaller the sample of glaciers analysed, the more variable are the rates of change reported for a specific region (Table 4.SM.1). In many regions of the world, rates of area loss have increased (Table 4.SM.1), confirming that glaciers are still too large for the current climate and will continue to shrink (see {FAQ_4_2 FAQ 4.2} and {Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_3 Section 4.3.3.3}).

Several studies have reported the disappearance of glaciers, among others in Arctic Canada ({cite.4.'Thomson_et_al_2011}), the Rocky Mountains ({cite.4.'Bolch_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Tennant_et_al_2012}) and North Cascades ({cite.4.'Pelto_2006}), Patagonia ({cite.4.'Bown_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Davies_and_Glasser_2012}), several tropical mountain ranges ({cite.4.'Coudrain_et_al_2005}; {cite.4.'Klein_and_Kincaid_2006}; {cite.4.'Cullen_et_al_2013}), the European Alps ({cite.4.'Citterio_et_al_2007}; {cite.4.'Knoll_and_Kerschner_2009}; {cite.4.'Diolaiuti_et_al_2012}), the Tien Shan ({cite.4.'Hagg_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Kutuzov_and_Shahgedanova_2009}) in Asia and on James Ross Island in Antarctica ({cite.4.'Carrivick_et_al_2012}). In total, the disappearance of more than 600 glaciers has been reported, but the real number is certainly higher. Also some of the glaciers, whose annual mass balance has been measured over several years or even decades, have disappeared or started to disintegrate ({cite.4.'Ramirez_et_al_2001}; {cite.4.'Carturan_and_Seppi_2007}; {cite.4.'Thibert_et_al_2008}). Though the number of glaciers that have disappeared is difficult to compare directly (e.g., the time periods analysed or the disappearance-criteria applied differ), glaciers that have disappeared provide robust evidence that the ELA (see Glossary) has risen above the highest peaks in many mountain ranges (see {FAQ_4_2 FAQ 4.2}).
