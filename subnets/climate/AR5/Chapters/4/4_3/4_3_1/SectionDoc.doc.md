title: 4.3.1 - Current Area and Volume of Glaciers

The total area covered by glaciers was only roughly known in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, resulting in large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} for all related calculations (e.g., overall glacier volume or mass changes). Since AR4, the world glacier inventory ({cite.4.'WGMS_1989}) was gradually extended by {cite.4.'Cogley_2009a Cogley (2009a)} and RadicÃÅ and Hock (2010); and for AR5, a new globally complete data set of glacier outlines (Randolph {Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} Inventory (RGI)) was compiled from a wide range of data sources from the 1950s to 2010 with varying levels of detail and quality ({cite.4.'Arendt_et_al_2012}). Regional glacier-covered areas for 19 regions were extracted from the RGI and supplemented with the percentage of the area covered by glaciers terminating in tidewater ({'Figure_4_8 Figure 4.8} and {'Table_4_2 Table 4.2}). The areas covered by glaciers that are in contact with freshwater lakes are only locally available. The separation of so-called peripheral glaciers from the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica is not easy. A new detailed inventory of the glaciers in Greenland ({cite.4.'Rastner_et_al_2012}) allows for estimation of their area, volume, and mass balance separately from those of the {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet}. This separation is still incomplete for Antarctica, and values discussed here ({'Figure_4_1 Figures 4.1}, 4.8 to 4.11, Tables {'Table_4_2 4.2} and {'Table_4_4 4.4}) refer to the glaciers on the islands in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic ({cite.4.'Bliss_et_al_2013}) but exclude glaciers on the mainland of Antarctica that are separate from the ice sheet. Regionally variable accuracy of the glacier outlines leads to poorly quantified uncertainties. These uncertainties, along with the regional variation in the minimum size of glaciers included in the inventory, and the subdivision of contiguous ice masses, also makes the total number of glaciers uncertain; the current best estimate is around 170,000 covering a total area of about 730,000 km2. When summed up, nearly 80% of the glacier area found in regions Antarctic and Subantarctic ({Topics.*Regional_Climate region} 19), Canadian Arctic (regions 3 and 4), High Mountain Asia (regions 13, 14 and 15), Alaska (region 5), and Greenland (region 17) ({'Table_4_2 Table 4.2}).

From the glacier areas in the new inventory, total glacier volumes and masses have been determined by applying both simple scaling relations and ice-dynamical considerations ({'Table_4_2 Table 4.2}, and references therein), however, both methods are calibrated with only a few hundred glacier thickness measurements. This small sample means that uncertainties are large and difficult to quantify. The range of values as derived from four global-scale studies for each of the 19 RGI regions is given in {'Table_4_2 Table 4.2}, suggesting a global glacier mass that is likely between 114,000 and 192,000 Gt (314 to 529 mm {Glossary.*Sea_level_equivalent SLE}). The numbers and areas of glaciers reported in {'Table_4_2 Table 4.2} are directly taken from RGI 2.0 ({cite.4.'Arendt_et_al_2012}), with updates for the Low Latitudes (region 16) and the Southern Andes (region 17).
