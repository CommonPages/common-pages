title: 4.3 - Glaciers

This section considers all perennial surface land ice masses (defined in 4.1 and Glossary) outside of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Glaciers occur where climate conditions and topographic characteristics allow snow to accumulate over several years and to transform gradually into firn (snow that persists for at least one year) and finally to ice. Under the force of gravity, this ice flows downwards to elevations with higher temperatures where various processes of ablation (loss of snow and ice) dominate over accumulation (gain of snow and ice). The sum of all accumulation and ablation processes determines the mass balance of a {Glossary.*Glacier glacier}. {Glossary.*Accumulation Accumulation} is in most regions due mainly to solid precipitation (in general snow), but also results from refreezing of liquid water, especially in polar regions or at high altitudes where firn remains below melting temperature. Ablation is, in most regions, mainly due to surface melting with subsequent {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, but loss of ice by {Glossary.*Calving calving} (on land or in water; see Glossary) or sublimation (important in dry regions) can also dominate. Re-distribution of snow by wind and avalanches can contribute to both accumulation and ablation. The energy and mass fluxes governing the surface mass balance are directly linked to atmospheric conditions and are modified by topography (e.g., due to shading). Glaciers are sensitive climate indicators because they adjust their size in response to changes in climate (e.g., temperature and precipitation) ({FAQ_4_2 FAQ 4.2}). Glaciers are also important seasonal to long-term hydrologic reservoirs (WGII, {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}) on a regional scale and a major contributor to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise on a global scale (see {Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_4 Section 4.3.3.4} and {Chapters.13 Chapter 13}). In the following, we report global glacier coverage ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_1 Section 4.3.1}), how changes in length, area, volume and mass are determined ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_2 Section 4.3.2}) and the observed changes in these parameters through time ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3 Section 4.3.3}).
