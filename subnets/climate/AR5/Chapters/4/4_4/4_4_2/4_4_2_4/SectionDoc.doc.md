title: 4.4.2.4 - Ice Shelves and Floating Ice Tongues

As much as 74% of the ice discharged from the grounded {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} in Antarctica passes through ice shelves and floating ice tongues ({cite.4.'Bindschadler_et_al_2011}). Ice shelves help to buttress and restrain flow of the grounded ice ({cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Scambos_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Hulbe_et_al_2008}), and so changes in thickness ({cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2003}, 2010; {cite.4.'Fricker_and_Padman_2012}), and extent ({cite.4.'Doake_and_Vaughan_1991}; {cite.4.'Scambos_et_al_2004}) of ice shelves influence current ice sheet change. Indeed, nearly all of the outlet glaciers and ice streams that are experiencing high rates of ice loss flow into thinning or disintegrated ice shelves ({cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}). Many of the larger ice shelves however, exhibit stable conditions ({cite.4.'King_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}).

Around the Antarctic Peninsula, the reduction in ice-shelf extent has been ongoing for several decades ({cite.4.'Cook_and_Vaughan_2010}; {cite.4.'Fricker_and_Padman_2012}), and has continued since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} with substantial collapse of a section of Wilkins Ice Shelf ({cite.4.'Humbert_et_al_2010}), which had been retreating since the late1990s ({cite.4.'Scambos_et_al_2000}). Overall, 7 of 12 ice shelves around the Peninsula have retreated in recent decades with a total loss of 28,000 km2, and a continuing rate of loss of around 6000 km2 per decade ({cite.4.'Cook_and_Vaughan_2010}). There is high confidence that this retreat of ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula has been related to changing atmospheric temperatures (e.g., {cite.4.'Scambos_et_al_2000}; {cite.4.'Morris_and_Vaughan_2003}; {cite.4.'Marshall_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Holland_et_al_2011}). There is low confidence that changes in the ocean have also contributed (e.g., {cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2003}; {cite.4.'Holland_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Nicholls_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Padman_et_al_2012}).
