title: 4.4.2.1.1 - Mass budget method

The mass budget method (see Glossary) relies on estimating the difference between net surface balance over the {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} (input) and perimeter ice discharge flux (output). This method requires comparison of two very large numbers, and even small percentage errors in either may result in large errors in total mass balance. For ice discharge, perimeter fluxes are calculated from measurements of ice velocity and ice thickness at the {Glossary.*Grounding_line grounding line}. Knowledge of perimeter fluxes has improved significantly since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} for both ice sheets ({cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2011b}) as a result of more complete ice-thickness data ({cite.4.'Bamber_et_al_2013}; {cite.4.'Fretwell_et_al_2013}) and velocity data from satellite radar interferometry and other techniques ({cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2010b}; {cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2011a}). However, incomplete ice thickness mapping still causes {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in ice discharge of 2 to 15% in Antarctica ({cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2008b}) and 10% in Greenland ({cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2011}; Rignot et al., 2011c).

Regional atmospheric {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} (see Glossary) verified using independent in situ data are increasingly preferred to produce estimates of surface mass balance over models that are recalibrated or corrected with in situ data ({cite.4.'Box_et_al_2009}), {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} of global re-analysis data (see Glossary) ({cite.4.'Hanna_et_al_2011}), or interpolation of in situ measurements ({cite.4.'Arthern_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Bales_et_al_2009}). In Antarctica, surface mass balance (excluding ice shelves) for 1979–2010 is estimated at 1983 ± 122 Gt yr–1 (van de Berg et al., 2006; {cite.4.'Lenaerts_et_al_2012}) with interannual variability of 114 Gt yr–1 driven by snowfall variability ({'Figure_4_14 Figure 4.14}). Comparison with 750 in situ observations indicates an overall uncertainty of 6% for total ice sheet mass balance, ranging from 5 to 20% for individual drainage basins (van de Berg et al., 2006; {cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2008b}; {cite.4.'Lenaerts_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2012}). In Greenland, total snowfall (697 Gt yr–1) and rainfall (46 Gt yr–1) minus {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} (248 Gt yr–1) and evaporation/sublimation (26 Gt yr–1) yield a surface mass balance of 469 ± 82 Gt yr–1 for 1958–2007 ({cite.4.'Ettema_et_al_2009}). The 17% uncertainty is based on a comparison of model outputs with 350 in situ {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} observations and, in the absence of runoff data, an imposed 20% uncertainty in runoff ({cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2011}). Interannual variability in surface mass balance is large (107 Gt yr–1) due to the out-of-phase relationship between the variability in precipitation (78 Gt yr–1) and runoff (67 Gt yr–1).
