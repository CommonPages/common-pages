title: 4.4.2.1 - Techniques

The three broad techniques for measuring ice-sheet mass balance are the mass budget method, repeated {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} and measurement of temporal variations in the Earthâ€™s gravity field. Each method has been applied to both ice sheets by multiple groups, and over time scales ranging from multiple years to decades (Figures {'Figure_4_13 4.13} and {'Figure_4_14 4.14}). The peripheral glaciers, surrounding but not strictly a part of the ice sheets, are not treated in the same manner by each technique. Peripheral glaciers are generally excluded from estimates using the mass budget method, they are sometimes, but not always, included in altimetric estimates, and they are almost always included in gravity estimates.
