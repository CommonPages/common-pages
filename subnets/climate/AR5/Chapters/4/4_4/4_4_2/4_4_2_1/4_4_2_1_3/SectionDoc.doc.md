title: 4.4.2.1.3 - Temporal variations in Earth gravity field

Since 2002, the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission has surveyed the Earth’s time-variable gravity field. Time-variable gravity provides a direct estimate of the ice-mass change at a spatial {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of about 300 km ({cite.4.'Wahr_2007}). GRACE data yielded early estimates of trends in ice-mass changes over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and confirmed regions of ice loss in coastal Greenland and West Antarctica ({cite.4.'Luthcke_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Velicogna_and_Wahr_2006a}, 2006b). With extended time series, now more than 10 years, estimates of {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} mass change from GRACE have lower {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} than in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (e.g., {cite.4.'Harig_and_Simons_2012}; {cite.4.'King_et_al_2012}). The ice-loss signal from the last decade is also more distinct because the numbers have grown significantly higher (e.g., {cite.4.'Wouters_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Cazenave_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Chen_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Velicogna_2009}). The estimates of ice loss based on data from GRACE vary between published studies due to the time-variable nature of the signal, along with other factors that include (1) data-centre specific processing, (2) specific methods used to calculate the mass change, and (3) contamination by other signals within the ice sheet (e.g., glacial {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} adjustment or {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA}, see Glossary) or outside the ice sheet (continental hydrology, ocean circulation). Many of these differences have been reduced in studies published since AR4, resulting in greater agreement between GRACE estimates ({cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2012}).

In Antarctica, the GIA signal is similar in magnitude to the ice-loss signal, with an uncertainty of ±80 Gt yr–1 ({cite.4.'Velicogna_and_Wahr_2006b}; {cite.4.'Riva_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Velicogna_2009}). Correction for the GIA signal is addressed using numerical models (e.g., {cite.4.'Ivins_and_James_2005}; {cite.4.'Paulson_et_al_2007}; {cite.4.'Peltier_2009}). A comparison of recent GIA models ({cite.4.'Tarasov_and_Peltier_2002}; {cite.4.'Fleming_and_Lambeck_2004}; {cite.4.'Peltier_2004}; {cite.4.'Ivins_and_James_2005}; {cite.4.'Simpson_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Whitehouse_et_al_2012}) with improved constraints on ice-loading history, indicate better agreement with direct observations of vertical land movements ({cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2011a}), despite a potential discrepancy between far-field {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} records and common NH {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} models. In Greenland, the GIA correction is less than 10% of the GRACE signal with an error of ±19 Gt yr–1. However, because the GIA rate is constant over the satellite’s {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime}, GIA uncertainty does not affect the estimate of any change in the rate of ice mass loss (acceleration/deceleration). In Antarctica, the adoption of new GIA models has resulted in a lowering of estimated ice-sheet mass loss ({cite.4.'King_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2012}).

In addition to GRACE, the elastic response of the crustal deformation shown in GPS measurements of uplift rates confirms increasing rates of ice loss in Greenland ({cite.4.'Khan_et_al_2010b}; {cite.4.'Khan_et_al_2010a}) and Antarctica ({cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2011a}). Analysis of a 34-year time series of the Earth’s oblateness (J2) by satellite laser ranging also suggests that ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has progressively dominated the change in oblateness {Glossary.*Trend trend} since the 1990s ({cite.4.'Nerem_and_Wahr_2011}).
