title: 4.4.2.1.2 - Repeated altimetry

Repeated altimetric survey allows measurement of rates of surface-elevation change, and after various corrections (for changes in snow density and bed elevation; or if the ice is floating, for tides and {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level}) reveals changes in {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} mass. Satellite radar {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} (SRALT) has been widely used ({cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2008b}; {cite.4.'Wingham_et_al_2009}), as has laser altimetry from airplanes ({cite.4.'Krabill_et_al_2002}; {cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2009}) and satellites ({cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Abdalati_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Sorensen_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Zwally_et_al_2011}). Both radar and laser methods have significant challenges. The field-of-view of early SRALT sensors was ~20 km in diameter, and as a consequence, interpretation of the data they acquired over ice sheets with undulating surfaces or significant slopes was complex. Also, for radar altimeters, estimates are affected by penetration of the radar signal below the surface, which depends on characteristics such as snow density and wetness, and by wide orbit separation ({cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2008b}). Errors in surface-elevation change are typically determined from the internal consistency of the measurements, often after iterative removal of surface elevation-change values that exceed some multiple of the local value of their standard deviation; this results in very small error estimates ({cite.4.'Zwally_et_al_2005}).

Laser altimeters have been used from aircraft for many years, but satellite laser altimetry, available for the first time from NASA’s ICESat satellite launched in 2003, has provided many new results since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Laser altimetry is easier to validate and interpret than radar data; the field of view is small (1 m diameter for airborne lasers, 60 m for ICESat), and there is negligible penetration below the surface. However, clouds limit data acquisition, and accuracy is affected by atmospheric conditions, laser-pointing errors, and data scarcity.

Knowledge of the density of the snow and firn in the upper layers of an ice sheet is required to convert altimetric measurements to mass change. However, snow densification rates are sensitive to snow temperature and wetness. Warm conditions favour more rapid densification ({cite.4.'Arthern_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Li_and_Zwally_2011}). Consequently, recent Greenland warming has probably caused surface lowering simply from this effect. Corrections are inferred from models that are difficult to validate and are typically less than 2 cm yr–1. ICESat derived surface elevation changes supplemented with differenced ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal {Topics.*Emissions Emission} and Reflection Radiometer) satellite digital elevation models were used for outlet glaciers in southeast Greenland ({cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2008}) and for the northern Antarctic Peninsula ({cite.4.'Shuman_et_al_2011}). Laser surveys from airborne platforms over Greenland yield elevation estimates accurate to 10 cm along reference targets ({cite.4.'Krabill_et_al_1999}; {cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2009}) and 15 cm for ICESat using ground-based high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} GPS measurements ({cite.4.'Siegfried_et_al_2011}). For a 5-year separation between surveys, this is an {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of 2.0 cm yr–1 for airborne platforms and 3 cm yr–1 for ICESat.

Early in 2013, NASA released an elevation correction for ICESat (National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2013) that is relevant to several studies cited in this chapter, but was provided too late to be included in those studies. This correction improves shot-to-shot variability in ICESat elevations, although spatial averaging and application of inter-campaign bias corrections derived from calibration data and used in many studies already mitigates the impact of the higher variability. The correction also changes elevation {Glossary.*Trend trend} estimates over the 2003– 2009 ICESat mission period by up to –1.4 cm yr–1.

To date, a thorough treatment of the impact of this finding has not been published in the peer-reviewed literature, but the overall magnitude of the effect is reported to be at the level of 1.4 cm yr–1. For many studies of glaciers, ice sheets and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} this is substantially lower (in some cases, an order of magnitude lower) than the signal of change, but elsewhere (e.g, for elevation changes in East Antarctica) it may have an impact. However, {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence}, of which ICESat is only one, are used to arrive at the conclusions presented in this chapter. To the degree to which it can be assessed, there is high confidence that the substantive conclusions this chapter will not be affected by revisions of the ICESat data products.
