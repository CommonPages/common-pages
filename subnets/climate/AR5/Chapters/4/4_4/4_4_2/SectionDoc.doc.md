title: 4.4.2 - Changes in Mass of Ice Sheets

The current state of mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is assessed in sections 4.4.2.2 and 4.4.2.3, but is introduced by a discussion of the improvements in techniques of measurement and understanding of the change made since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (e.g., {cite.4.'Lemke_et_al_2007}; {cite.4.'Cazenave_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Chen_et_al_2011}).
