title: 4.4.4.1.1 - Snowfall and surface temperature

Ice sheets experience large interannual variability in snowfall, and local trends may deviate significantly from the long-term {Glossary.*Trend trend} in integrated snowfall. However, as in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the available data do not suggest any significant long-term change in {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} in Antarctica, except for the Antarctic Peninsula ({cite.4.'Monaghan_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Ettema_et_al_2009}; van den Broeke et al., 2009; {cite.4.'Bromwich_et_al_2011}).

Increasing air temperature will (when above the freezing point) increase the amount of surface melt, and can also increase the moisture bearing capacity of the air, and hence can increase snowfall. Over Greenland, temperature has risen significantly since the early 1990s, reaching values similar to those in the 1930s ({cite.4.'Box_et_al_2009}). The year 2010 was an exceptionally warm year in west Greenland with Nuuk having the warmest year since the start of the temperature record in 1873 ({cite.4.'Tedesco_et_al_2011}). In West Antarctica, the warming since the 1950s ({cite.4.'Steig_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Ding_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Schneider_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Bromwich_et_al_2013}), the magnitude and seasonality of which are still debated, has not manifested itself in enhanced surface melting ({cite.4.'Tedesco_and_Monaghan_2009}; Kuipers Munneke et al., 2012) nor in increased snowfall ({cite.4.'Monaghan_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Bromwich_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Lenaerts_et_al_2012}). Statistically significant summer warming has been observed on the east coast of the northern Antarctic Peninsula ({cite.4.'Marshall_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Chapman_and_Walsh_2007}), with extension of summer melt duration ({cite.4.'Barrand_et_al_2013}), while East Antarctica has showed summer cooling ({cite.4.'Turner_et_al_2005}). In contrast, the significant winter warming at Faraday/Vernadsky station on the western Antarctic Peninsula is attributable to a reduction of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} extent ({cite.4.'Turner_et_al_2005}).
