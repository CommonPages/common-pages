title: 4.4.4.2.2 - Cryo-hydrologic warming

Percolation and refreezing of surface meltwater that drains through the ice column may alter the thermal regime of the {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} on decadal time scales ({cite.4.'Phillips_et_al_2010}). This process is known as cryo-hydrologic warming, and it could affect ice rheology and hence ice flow.
