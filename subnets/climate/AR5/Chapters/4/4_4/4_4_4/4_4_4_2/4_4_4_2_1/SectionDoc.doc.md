title: 4.4.4.2.1 - Basal lubrication

Ice flows in part by sliding over the underlying rock and sediment, which is lubricated by water at the ice base: a process known as {Glossary.*Basal_lubrication basal lubrication} (see Glossary). In many regions close to the Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} margin, abundant summer meltwater on the surface of the ice sheet forms large lakes. This surface water can drain to the ice sheet bed, thus increasing basal water pressure, reducing basal friction and increasing ice flow speed ({cite.4.'Zwally_et_al_2002b}).

Such drainage events are common in southwest and northeast Greenland, but rare in the most rapidly changing southeast and northwest regions ({cite.4.'Selmes_et_al_2011}). The effect can be seen in diurnal flow variations of some land-terminating regions ({cite.4.'Das_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Shepherd_et_al_2009}), and after lake-drainage events, when 50 to 110% short-term speed-up of flow has been observed. However, the effect is temporally and spatially restricted ({cite.4.'Das_et_al_2008}). The summer increase in speed over the annual mean is only ~10â€“20%, the increase is less at higher elevations ({cite.4.'Bartholomew_et_al_2011}), and observations suggest most lake drainages do not affect ice sheet velocity ({cite.4.'Hoffman_et_al_2011}). Theory and field studies suggest an initial increase in flow rate with increased surface meltwater supply ({cite.4.'Bartholomew_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Palmer_et_al_2011}), but if the supply of surface water continues to increase and subglacial drainage becomes more efficient, basal water pressure, and thus basal motion, is reduced (van de Wal et al., 2008; {cite.4.'Schoof_2010}; {cite.4.'Sundal_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Shannon_et_al_2012}). Overall, there is high confidence that basal lubrication is important in modulating flow in some regions, especially southwest Greenland, but there is also high confidence that it does not explain recent dramatic regional speed-ups that have resulted in rapid increases in ice loss from {Glossary.*Calving calving} glaciers.
