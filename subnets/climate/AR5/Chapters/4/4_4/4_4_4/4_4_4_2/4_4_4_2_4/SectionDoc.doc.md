title: 4.4.4.2.4 - Ice–ocean interaction

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} it has become far more evident that the rates of submarine melting can be very large (e.g., {cite.4.'Motyka_et_al_2003}). The rate of melting is proportional to the product of ocean thermal {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} (difference between ocean temperature and the in situ freezing point of seawater) and water flow speed at the ice–ocean interface ({cite.4.'Holland_and_Jenkins_1999}). Melt rates along marine-terminating {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} margins are one-to-two orders of magnitude greater than for ice shelves because of the additional buoyancy forces provided by the discharge of sub-glacial melt water at the glacier base ({cite.4.'Motyka_et_al_2003}; {cite.4.'Jenkins_2011}; {cite.4.'Straneo_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Xu_et_al_2012}). In South Greenland, there is medium confidence that the acceleration of glaciers from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s was due to the intrusion of ocean waters of subtropical origin into glacial fjords ({cite.4.'Holland_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Murray_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Straneo_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Christoffersen_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Motyka_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Straneo_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Rignot_and_Mouginot_2012}). Models suggest that the increase in ice melting by the ocean contributed to the reduction of backstress experienced by glaciers and subsequent acceleration ({cite.4.'Payne_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Schoof_2007}; {cite.4.'Nick_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Nick_et_al_2013}; O’Leary and Christoffersen, 2013): changes in the floating mixture of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, iceberg debris and blown snow in front of the glacier may also play a part ({cite.4.'Amundson_et_al_2010}).
