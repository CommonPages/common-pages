title: 4.4.4.2.3 - Ice shelf buttressing

Recent changes in marginal regions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets include some thickening and slowdown of outlet glaciers, but mostly thinning and acceleration (e.g., {cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Sorensen_et_al_2011}), with some {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} speeds increasing twoto eight-fold ({cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Scambos_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Luckman_and_Murray_2005}; {cite.4.'Rignot_and_Kanagaratnam_2006}; {cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2007}). Many of the largest and fastest glacier changes appear to be at least partly a response to thinning, shrinkage or loss of ice shelves or floating ice tongues ({cite.4.'MacGregor_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}). This type of glacier response is consistent with classical models of {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} buttressing proposed 40 years ago ({cite.4.'Hughes_1973}; {cite.4.'Weertman_1974}; {cite.4.'Mercer_1978}; {cite.4.'Thomas_and_Bentley_1978}).
