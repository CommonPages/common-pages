title: 4.4.5 - Rapid Ice Sheet Changes

The {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise presented in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} explicitly excluded future rapid dynamical changes (see Glossary) in ice flow, and stated that ‘understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude’. Considerable efforts have been made since AR4 to fill this knowledge gap. {Chapters.13 Chapter 13} discusses observed and likely future sea level, including model projections of changes in the volume stored in the ice sheets: in this section we summarise the processes thought to be potential causes of rapid changes in ice flow and emphasise new observational evidence that these processes are already underway.

‘Rapid {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} changes’ are defined as changes that are of sufficient speed and magnitude to impact on the mass budget and hence rate of sea level rise on time scales of several decades or shorter. A further consideration is whether and under what circumstances any such changes are ‘irreversible’, that is, would take several decades to centuries to reverse under a different climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. For example, an effectively irreversible change might be the loss of a significant fraction of the Greenland ice sheet, because at its new lower (and therefore warmer) surface elevation, the ice sheet would be able to grow thicker only slowly even in a cooler climate ({cite.4.'Ridley_et_al_2010}) ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_3 Section 13.4.3.3}).

Observations suggest that some observed changes in ice shelves and glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula are irreversible. These ice bodies continue to experience rapid and irreversible retreat, coincident with air temperatures rising at four to six times the global average rate at some stations ({cite.4.'Vaughan_et_al_2003}), and with warm Circumpolar Deep Water becoming widespread on the western continental shelf ({cite.4.'Martinson_et_al_2008}). Collapse of floating ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula, such as the 2002 collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf which is unprecedented in the last 10,000 years, has resulted in speed up of tributary glaciers by 300 to 800% (De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003; {cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Scambos_et_al_2004}; {cite.4.'Rott_et_al_2011}). Even if iceberg {Glossary.*Calving calving} was to cease entirely, regrowth of the Larsen B {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} to its pre-collapse state would take centuries based on the ice-shelf speed and size prior to its collapse ({cite.4.'Rignot_et_al_2004}).

Surface melt that becomes {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} is a major contributor to mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet, which results in a lower (hence warmer) ice sheet surface and a lower surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} (allowing the surface to absorb more {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}); both processes further increase melt. The warm summers of the last two decades (van den Broeke et al., 2009; {cite.4.'Hanna_et_al_2011}), and especially in 2012 ({cite.4.'Hall_et_al_2013}), are unusual in the multi-centennial record. Exceptionally high melt events have affected even the far north of Greenland, for example, with the partial collapse of the floating ice tongues of Ostenfeld Gletscher and Zachariae Isstrom in 2000–2006 ({cite.4.'Moon_and_Joughin_2008}).

The importance that subsurface warm waters play in melting the periphery of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and the evolution of these ice sheets, has become much clearer since AR4 (see Sections 4.4.3.1 and 4.4.3.2). New observations in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as advances in theoretical understanding, show that regions of ice sheets that are grounded well below sea level are most likely to experience rapid ice mass loss, especially if the supply of heat to the ice margin increases ({cite.4.'Schoof_2007}; {cite.4.'Holland_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Joughin_and_Alley_2011}; {cite.4.'Motyka_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Young_et_al_2011a}; {cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2012}; {cite.4.'Ross_et_al_2012}) (See also {'Figure_4_18 Figure 4.18}.) Where this ice meets the ocean and does not form an ice shelf, warm waters can increase melting at the ice front, causing undercutting, higher calving rates, ice-front retreat ({cite.4.'Motyka_et_al_2003}; {cite.4.'Benn_et_al_2007}; {cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2011a}) and consequent speed-up and thinning. Surface runoff also increases subglacial water discharge at the {Glossary.*Grounding_line grounding line}, which enhances ice melting at the ice front ({cite.4.'Jenkins_2011}; {cite.4.'Xu_et_al_2012}). Where an ice shelf is present, ice melt by the ocean may cause thinning of the shelf as well as migration of the grounding line further inland into deep basins, with a major impact on buttressing, flow speed and thinning rate ({cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2011a}).

The influence of the ocean on the ice sheets is controlled by the delivery of heat to the ice sheet margins, particularly to ocean cavities beneath ice shelves and to calving fronts ({cite.4.'Jenkins_and_Doake_1991}; {cite.4.'Jacobs_et_al_2011}). The amount of heat delivered is a function of the temperature and salinity of ocean waters; ocean circulation; and the bathymetry of continental shelves, in fjords near glacier fronts and beneath ice shelves, most of which are not known in sufficient detail ({cite.4.'Jenkins_and_Jacobs_2008}; {cite.4.'Holland_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Dinniman_et_al_2012}; Galton-Fenzi et al., 2012; {cite.4.'Padman_et_al_2012}). Changes in any of these parameters would have a direct and rapid impact on melt rates and potentially on calving fluxes (see {Chapters.13 Chapter 13}).

Ice grounded on a reverse bed-slope, deepening towards the ice sheet interior, is potentially subject to the marine ice sheet instability ({cite.4.'Weertman_1974}; {cite.4.'Schoof_2007}) (see {Box_13_2 Box 13.2}). Much of the bed of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) lies below sea level and on a reverse bed-slope, with basins extending to depths greater than 2 km ({'Figure_4_18 Figure 4.18}). The marine parts of the WAIS contain ~3.4 m of equivalent sea level rise ({cite.4.'Bamber_et_al_2013}; {cite.4.'Fretwell_et_al_2013}), and a variety of evidence strongly suggests that the ice sheet volume has been much smaller than present in the last 1 million years, during periods with temperatures similar to those {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} in the next century (see also {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}) ({cite.4.'Kopp_et_al_2009}). Potentially unstable marine ice sheets also exist in East Antarctica, for example, in Wilkes Land ({cite.4.'Young_et_al_2011a}), and these contain more ice than WAIS (9 m {Glossary.*Sea_level_equivalent sea level equivalent} for Wilkes Land). In northern Greenland, ice is also grounded below sea level, with reverse slopes ({'Figure_4_18 Figure 4.18}; {cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_1999}).

Observations since AR4 confirm that rapid changes are indeed occurring at the marine margins of ice sheets, and that these changes have been observed to penetrate hundreds of kilometres inland ({cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2010b}).

The Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica is grounded significantly below sea level and is the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of Antarctica changing most rapidly at present. Pine Island {Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} has sped up 73% since 1974 ({cite.4.'Rignot_2008}) and has thinned throughout 1995–2008 at increasing rates ({cite.4.'Wingham_et_al_2009}) due to grounding line retreat. There is medium confidence that retreat was caused by the intrusion of warm ocean water into the sub-ice shelf cavity ({cite.4.'Jenkins_et_al_2010}; {cite.4.'Jacobs_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Steig_et_al_2012}). The neighbouring Thwaites, Smith and Kohler glaciers are also speeding-up, thinning and contributing to increasing mass loss ({'Figure_4_14 Figure 4.14}). The present rates of thinning are more than one order of magnitude larger than millennial-scale thinning rates in this area ({cite.4.'Johnson_et_al_2008}). Changes in velocity, elevation, thickness and grounding line position observed in the past two to three decades in the Pine Island/

Thwaites Glacier sector are not inconsistent with the development of a marine ice sheet instability triggered by a change in climate forcing, but neither are they inconsistent solely with a response to external environmental (probably oceanic) forcing.

In Greenland, there is medium confidence that the recent rapid retreat of Jakobshavn Isbrae was caused by the intrusion of warm ocean water beneath the floating ice tongue ({cite.4.'Holland_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Motyka_et_al_2011}) combined with other factors, such as weakening of the floating mixture of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, iceberg debris and blown snow within ice rifts ({cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2008b}; {cite.4.'Amundson_et_al_2010}). There is medium confidence that recent variations in southeast Greenland’s glaciers have been caused by intrusion of warm waters of subtropical origin into glacial fjords. Since AR4 it has become clear that the mid-2000s speed up of southeast Greenland glaciers, which caused a doubling of ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet ({cite.4.'Luthcke_et_al_2006}; {cite.4.'Rignot_and_Kanagaratnam_2006}; {cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Wouters_et_al_2008}), was a pulse that was followed by a partial slow down ({cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2008}; {cite.4.'Murray_et_al_2010}). Although changes in elevation in the north are not as large as in the south, marine sectors were thinning in 2003–2008 ({cite.4.'Pritchard_et_al_2009}; {cite.4.'Sorensen_et_al_2011}).

In contrast to the rapidly changing marine margins of the ice sheets, land-terminating regions of the Greenland ice sheet are changing more slowly, and these changes are explained largely by changes in the input of snow and loss of meltwater ({cite.4.'Sole_et_al_2011}). Surface meltwater, although abundant on the Greenland ice sheet, does not seem to be driving significant changes in {Glossary.*Basal_lubrication basal lubrication} that impact on ice sheet flow ({cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2008b}; {cite.4.'Selmes_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Sundal_et_al_2011}).

In Greenland, the observed changes are not all irreversible. The Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland accelerated, retreated and increased its calving flux during the period 2002–2005 ({cite.4.'Howat_et_al_2011}; {cite.4.'Andresen_et_al_2012}), but its calving flux similarly increased during the late 1930s – early 1940s ({cite.4.'Andresen_et_al_2012}): an episode from which the glacier subsequently recovered and re-advanced ({cite.4.'Joughin_et_al_2008b}). The collapse of the floating tongue of Jakobshavn Isbrae in 2002 and consequent loss of buttressing has considerably increased ice flow speeds and discharge from the ice sheet. At present, the glacier grounding line is retreating 0.5–0.6 km yr–1 ({cite.4.'Thomas_et_al_2011b}; {cite.4.'Rosenau_et_al_2013}), with speeds in excess of 11 km yr–1 ({cite.4.'Moon_et_al_2012}), and the glacier is retreating on a bed that deepens further inland, which could be conducive to a marine instability. However, there is evidence that Jakobshavn Isbrae has undergone significant margin changes over the last approximately 8000 years which may have been both more and less extensive than the recent ones ({cite.4.'Young_et_al_2011b}).

Since AR4, many new observations indicate that changes in ice sheets can happen more rapidly than was previously recognised. Similarly, evidence presented since AR4 indicates that interactions with both the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and ocean are key drivers of decadal ice-sheet change. So, although our understanding of the detailed processes that control the evolution of ice sheets in a warming climate remains incomplete, there is no indication in observations of a slowdown in the mass loss from ice sheets; instead, recent observations suggest an ongoing increase in mass loss.
