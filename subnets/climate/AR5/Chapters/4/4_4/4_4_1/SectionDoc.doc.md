title: 4.4.1 - Background

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, satellite, airborne and in situ observations have greatly improved our ability to identify and quantify change in the vast polar ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. As a direct consequence, our understanding of the underlying drivers of ice-sheet change is also much improved. These observations and the insights they yield are discussed throughout {Chapters.4.4_4 Section 4.4}, while the {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of recent {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} change, {Topics.*Climate_Projections projection} of future changes in ice sheets and their future contribution to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise are discussed in {Chapters.10 Chapter 10} and {Chapters.13 Chapter 13} respectively.
