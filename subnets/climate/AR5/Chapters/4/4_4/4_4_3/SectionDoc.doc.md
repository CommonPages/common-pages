title: 4.4.3 - Total Ice Loss from Both Ice Sheets

The total ice loss from both ice sheets for the 20 years 1992–2011 (inclusive) has been 4260 [3060 to 5460] Gt, equivalent to 11.7 [8.4 to 15.1] mm of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level}. However, the rate of change has increased with time and most of this ice has been lost in the second decade of the 20-year period. From the data presented in {'Figure_4_17 Figure 4.17}, the average loss in Greenland has very likely increased from 34 [–6 to 74] Gt yr–1 over the decade 1992–2001 ({Glossary.*Sea_level_equivalent sea level equivalent}, 0.09 [–0.02 to 0.20] mm yr–1), to 215 [157 to 274] Gt yr–1 over the decade 2002–2011 (0.59 [0.43 to 0.76] mm yr–1). In Antarctica, the loss has likely increased 30 [–37 to 97] Gt yr–1 (sea level equivalent, 0.08 [–0.10 to 0.27] mm yr–1) for 1992–2001, to 147 [72 to 221] Gt yr–1 for 2002–2011 (0.40 [0.20 to 0.61] mm yr–1). Over the last five years (2007–2011), the loss from both ice sheets combined has been equivalent to 1.2 ± 0.4 mm yr–1 of sea level ({'Figure_4_17 Figure 4.17} and {'Table_4_6 Table 4.6}).
