title: 1.3.2 - Greenhouse Gas Concentrations

Key indicators of global climate change also include the changing concentrations of the radiatively important {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} that are significant drivers for this change (e.g., {cite.1.'Denman_et_al_2007}; {cite.1.'Forster_et_al_2007}). {'Figure_1_5 Figures 1.5} through 1.7 show the recent globally and annually averaged observed concentrations for the gases of most concern, {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} (see Sections {Chapters.2.2_2 2.2}, {Chapters.6.6_3 6.3} and {Chapters.8.8_3 8.3} for more detailed discussion of these and other key gases). As discussed in the later chapters, accurate measurements of these long-lived gases come from a number of monitoring stations throughout the world. The observations in these figures are compared with the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} from the previous IPCC assessments.

The model simulations begin with historical {Topics.*Emissions emissions} up to 1990. The further evolution of these gases was described by scenario projections. {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} and {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} model concentrations after 1990 are based on the SRES {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} but those model results may also account for historical emissions analyses. The recent observed trends in CO2 concentrations tend to be in the middle of the scenarios used for the projections ({'Figure_1_5 Figure 1.5}).

As discussed in {cite.1.'Dlugokencky_et_al_2009 Dlugokencky et al. (2009)}, trends in CH4 showed a stabilization from 1999 to 2006, but CH4 concentrations have been increasing again starting in 2007 (see Sections {Chapters.2.2_2 2.2} and {Chapters.6.6_3 6.3} for more discussion on the budget and changing concentration trends for CH4). Because at the time the scenarios were developed (e.g., the {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} were developed in 2000), it was thought that past trends would continue, the scenarios used and the resulting model projections assumed in {cite.1.'IPCC_1990 FAR} through AR4 all show larger increases than those observed ({'Figure_1_6 Figure 1.6}).

Concentrations of N2O have continued to increase at a nearly constant rate ({cite.1.'Elkins_and_Dutton_2010}) since about 1970 as shown in {'Figure_1_7 Figure 1.7}. The observed trends tend to be in the lower part of the projections for the previous assessments.
