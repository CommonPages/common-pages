title: 1.3.1 - Global and Regional Surface Temperatures

Observed changes in global mean surface air temperature since 1950 (from three major databases, as anomalies relative to 1961–1990) are shown in {'Figure_1_4 Figure 1.4}. As in the prior assessments, global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} generally simulate global temperatures that compare well with observations over climate timescales ({Chapters.9.9_4 Section 9.4}). Even though the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} from the models were never intended to be {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} over such a short timescale, the observations through 2012 generally fall within the projections made in all past assessments. The 1990– 2012 data have been shown to be consistent with the {cite.1.'IPCC_1990 FAR} projections ({cite.1.'IPCC_1990}), and not consistent with zero {Glossary.*Trend trend} from 1990, even in the presence of substantial natural variability ({cite.1.'Frame_and_Stone_2013}).

The scenarios were designed to span a broad range of plausible futures, but are not aimed at predicting the most likely outcome. The scenarios considered for the projections from the earlier reports (FAR, {cite.1.'IPCC_1996 SAR}) had a much simpler basis than those of the Special Report on {Topics.*Emissions Emission} {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} (SRES) ({cite.1.'IPCC_2000}) used in the later assessments. For example, the FAR scenarios did not specify future {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} distributions. {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} presented a multiple set of projections that were simulated using comprehensive ocean–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} models provided by CMIP3 and these projections are continuations of transient simulations of the 20th century climate. These projections of temperature provide in addition a measure of the natural variability that could not be obtained from the earlier projections based on models of intermediate complexity ({cite.1.'Cubasch_et_al_2001}).

Note that before {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} the climate models did not include natural {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} (such as volcanic activity and solar variability). Even in AR4 not all models included natural forcing and some also did not include aerosols. Those models that allowed for aerosol effects presented in the AR4 simulated, for example, the cooling effects of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption and agree better with the observed temperatures than the previous assessments that did not include those effects.

The bars on the side for FAR, SAR and TAR represent the range of results for the scenarios at the end of the time period and are not error bars. In contrast to the previous reports, the AR4 gave an assessment of the individual scenarios with a mean estimate (cross bar; {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean of the CMIP3 simulations) and a likely range (full bar; –40% to +60% of the mean estimate) ({cite.1.'Meehl_et_al_2007}).

In summary, the trend in globally averaged {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} falls within the range of the previous IPCC projections. During the last decade the trend in the observations is smaller than the mean of the projections of AR4 (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}, {Box_9_2 Box 9.2} for a detailed assessment of the hiatus in global mean surface warming in the last 15 years). As shown by {cite.1.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2009 Hawkins and Sutton (2009)}, trends in the observations during short-timescale periods (decades) can be dominated by natural variability in the Earth’s climate system. Similar episodes are also seen in climate model experiments ({cite.1.'Easterling_and_Wehner_2009}). Due to their experimental design these episodes cannot be duplicated with the same timing as the observed episodes in most of the model simulations; this affects the interpretation of recent trends in the scenario evaluations ({Chapters.11.11_2 Section 11.2}). Notwithstanding these points, there is evidence that early forecasts that carried formal estimates of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} have proved highly consistent with subsequent observations ({cite.1.'Allen_et_al_2013}). If the contributions of solar variability, volcanic activity and {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} are removed from the observations the remaining trend of surface air temperature agree better with the modelling studies ({cite.1.'Rahmstorf_et_al_2012}).
