title: 1.3.4.3 - Ice

Rapid sea ice loss is one of the most prominent indicators of Arctic climate change ({Chapters.4.4_2 Section 4.2}). There has been a {Glossary.*Trend trend} of decreasing Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent since 1978, with the summer of 2012 being the lowest in recorded history (see {Chapters.4.4_2 Section 4.2} for details). The 2012 minimum sea ice extent was 49% below the 1979 to 2000 average and 18% below the previous record from 2007. The amount of multi-year sea ice has been reduced, i.e., the sea ice has been thinning and thus the ice volume is reduced ({cite.1.'Haas_et_al_2008}; {cite.1.'Kwok_et_al_2009}). These changes make the sea ice less resistant to wind {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. {Glossary.*Sea_ice Sea ice} extent has been diminishing significantly faster than {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} by most of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.1.'SWIPA_2011}). While AR4 found no consistent trends in Antarctica sea ice, more recent studies indicate a small increase ({Chapters.4.4_2 Section 4.2}). Various studies since AR4 suggest that this has resulted in a deepening of the low-pressure systems in West Antarctica that in turn caused stronger winds and enhanced ice production in the Ross Sea ({cite.1.'Goosse_et_al_2009}; {cite.1.'Turner_and_Overland_2009}).

AR4 concluded that taken together, the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have very likely been contributing to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise. The Greenland Ice Sheet has lost mass since the early 1990s and the rate of loss has increased (see {Chapters.4.4_4 Section 4.4}). The interior, high-altitude areas are thickening due to increased snow {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation}, but this is more than counterbalanced by the ice loss due to melt and ice discharge ({cite.1.'AMAP_2009}; {cite.1.'Ettema_et_al_2009}). Since 1979, the area experiencing surface melting has increased significantly ({cite.1.'Tedesco_2007}; {cite.1.'Mernild_et_al_2009}), with 2010 breaking the record for surface melt area, {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, and mass loss, and the unprecedented areal extent of surface melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2012 ({cite.1.'Nghiem_et_al_2012}). Overall, the Antarctic continent now experiences a net loss of ice ({Chapters.4.4_4 Section 4.4}). Significant mass loss has been occurring in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica and the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} on the rest of the continent is relatively stable or thickening slightly ({cite.1.'Lemke_et_al_2007}; {cite.1.'Scott_et_al_2009}; {cite.1.'Turner_et_al_2009}). Since AR4, there have been improvements in techniques of measurement, such as gravity, {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} and mass balance, and understanding of the change ({Chapters.4.4_4 Section 4.4}).

As discussed in the earlier assessments, most glaciers around the globe have been shrinking since the end of the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age Little Ice Age}, with increasing rates of ice loss since the early 1980s ({Chapters.4.4_3 Section 4.3}). The vertical profiles of temperature measured through the entire thickness of mountain glaciers, or through ice sheets, provide clear evidence of a warming climate over recent decades (e.g., LuÌˆthi and Funk, 2001; {cite.1.'Hoelzle_et_al_2011}). As noted in AR4, the greatest mass losses per unit area in the last four decades have been observed in Patagonia, Alaska, northwest USA, southwest Canada, the European Alps, and the Arctic. Alaska and the Arctic are especially important regions as contributors to sea level rise ({cite.1.'Zemp_et_al_2008}, 2009).
