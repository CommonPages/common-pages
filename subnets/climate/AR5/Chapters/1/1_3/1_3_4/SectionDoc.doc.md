Climate change can lead to other effects on the Earthâ€™s physical system that are also indicators of climate change. Such integrative indicators include changes in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} (ocean warming + land ice melt), in {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} (ocean {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}) and in the amount of ice on ocean and land (temperature and hydrological changes). See Chapters {Chapters.3}, {Chapters.4} and {Chapters.13} for detailed assessment.
