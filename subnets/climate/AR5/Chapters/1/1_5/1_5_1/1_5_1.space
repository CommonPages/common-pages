section 1_5_1

  |Improved understanding and systematic monitoring of Earthâ€™s climate requires observations of various atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial parameters and therefore has to rely on various technologies. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) defined a list of so-called Essential Climate Variables, that are technically and economically feasible to observe, but some of the associated observing systems are not yet operated in a systematic manner. Model-based {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} products play an important role in obtaining a consistent picture of the climate system.
