title: 1.2.3 - Multiple Lines of Evidence for Climate Change

While the first IPCC assessment depended primarily on observed changes in {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} and climate model analyses, more recent assessments include {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence} for climate change. The first line of evidence in assessing climate change is based on careful analysis of observational records of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, land, ocean and {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere} systems ({'Figure_1_3 Figure 1.3}). There is incontrovertible evidence from in situ observations and {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records that the atmospheric concentrations of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} such as {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, and {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} have increased substantially over the last 200 years (Sections {Chapters.6.6_3 6.3} and {Chapters.8.8_3 8.3}). In addition, instrumental observations show that land and sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} have increased over the last 100 years ({Chapters.2 Chapter 2}). Satellites allow a much broader spatial distribution of measurements, especially over the last 30 years. For the upper ocean temperature the observations indicate that the temperature has increased since at least 1950 ({cite.1.'Willis_et_al_2010}; {Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}). Observations from satellites and in situ measurements suggest reductions in glaciers, Arctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} and ice sheets (Sections {Chapters.4.4_2 4.2}, {Chapters.4.4_3 4.3} and {Chapters.4.4_4 4.4}). In addition, analyses based on measurements of the radiative budget and ocean heat content suggest a small imbalance ({Chapters.2.2_3 Section 2.3}). These observations, all published in peer-reviewed journals, made by diverse measurement groups in multiple countries using different technologies, investigating various climate-relevant types of data, {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and processes, offer a wide range of evidence on the broad extent of the changing climate throughout our planet.

Conceptual and numerical models of the Earth’s climate system offer another line of evidence on climate change (discussions in Chapters {Chapters.5} and {Chapters.9} provide relevant analyses of this evidence from paleoclimatic to recent periods). These use our basic understanding of the climate system to provide self-consistent methodologies for calculating impacts of processes and changes. Numerical models include the current knowledge about the laws of physics, chemistry and biology, as well as hypotheses about how complicated processes such as cloud formation can occur. Because these models can represent only the existing state of knowledge and technology, they are not perfect; they are, however, important tools for analysing uncertainties or unknowns, for testing different hypotheses for causation relative to observations, and for making {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of possible future changes.

One of the most powerful methods for assessing changes occurring in climate involves the use of statistical tools to test the analyses from models relative to observations. This methodology is generally called {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} in the climate change community ({Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}). For example, {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} indicate that the temperature response to GHG increases is expected to be different than the effects from aerosols or from solar variability. Radiosonde measurements and satellite retrievals of atmospheric temperature show increases in tropospheric temperature and decreases in stratospheric temperatures, consistent with the increases in GHG effects found in climate model simulations (e.g., increases in CO2, changes in O3), but if the Sun was the main driver of current climate change, stratospheric and tropospheric temperatures would respond with the same sign ({cite.1.'Hegerl_et_al_2007}).

Resources available prior to the instrumental period—historical sources, natural archives, and proxies for key climate variables (e.g., {Glossary.*Tree_rings tree rings}, marine sediment cores, ice cores)—can provide quantitative information on past regional to global climate and atmospheric composition variability and these data contribute another line of evidence. Reconstructions of key climate variables based on these data sets have provided important information on the responses of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} to a variety of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} and its internal variability over a wide range of timescales ({cite.1.'Hansen_et_al_2006}; {cite.1.'Mann_et_al_2008}). Paleoclimatic reconstructions thus offer a means for placing the current changes in climate in the perspective of natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({Chapters.5.5_1 Section 5.1}). AR5 includes new information on external RFs caused by variations in volcanic and {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity} (e.g., {cite.1.'Steinhilber_et_al_2009}; see {Chapters.8.8_4 Section 8.4}). Extended data sets on past changes in atmospheric concentrations and distributions of atmospheric GHG concentrations (e.g., Lüthi et al., 2008; {cite.1.'Beerling_and_Royer_2011}) and mineral aerosols ({cite.1.'Lambert_et_al_2008}) have also been used to attribute reconstructed {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} temperatures to {Topics.*Past_Climate past variations} in external forcings ({Chapters.5.5_2 Section 5.2}).
