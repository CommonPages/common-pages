Observed Temperature

NASA GISS evaluation of the observations: {cite.1.'Hansen_et_al_2010 Hansen et al. (2010)} updated: The data were downloaded from http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt. Annual means are used (January to December) and anomalies are calculated relative to 1961–1990.

NOAA NCDC evaluation of the observations: {cite.1.'Smith_et_al_2008 Smith et al. (2008)} updated: The data were downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/ data/anomalies/annual.land_ocean.90S.90N.df_1901–2000mean.dat. Annual mean anomalies are calculated relative to 1961–1990.

Hadley Centre evaluation of the observations: {cite.1.'Morice_et_al_2012 Morice et al. (2012)}: The data were downloaded from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/ hadcrut4/data/current/download.html#regional_series. Annual mean anomalies are calculated relative to 1961–1990 based on the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} median.

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}: The temperature {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the AR4 are presented for three SRES {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}: B1, A1B and A2. Annual mean anomalies relative to 1961–1990 of the individual CMIP3 ensemble simulations (as used in AR4 SPM Figure SPM5) are shown. One outlier has been eliminated based on the advice of the model developers because of the {Glossary.*Model_drift model drift} that leads to an unrealistic temperature evolution. As assessed by {cite.1.'Meehl_et_al_2007 Meehl et al. (2007)}, the likely range for the temperature change is given by the ensemble mean temperature change +60% and –40% of the ensemble mean temperature change. Note that in the AR4 the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range was explicitly estimated for the end of the 21st century results. Here, it is shown for 2035. The time dependence of this range has been assessed in {cite.1.'Knutti_et_al_2008 Knutti et al. (2008)}. The relative uncertainty is approximately constant over time in all estimates from different sources, except for the very early decades when natural variability is being considered (see Figure 3 in {cite.1.'Knutti_et_al_2008}).

Data Processing

Observations

The observations are shown from 1950 to 2012 as annual mean anomaly relative to 1961–1990 (squares). For smoothing, first, the {Glossary.*Trend trend} of each of the observational data sets was calculated by locally weighted scatter plot smoothing ({cite.1.'Cleveland_1979}; f = 1/3). Then, the 11-year running means of the residuals were determined with reflected ends for the last 5 years. Finally, the trend was added back to the 11-year running means of the residuals.

Projections

For {cite.1.'IPCC_1990 FAR}, {cite.1.'IPCC_1996 SAR} and {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR}, the projections have been harmonized to match the average of the three smoothed observational data sets at 1990.

Observed {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} Concentrations

Global annual mean CO2 concentrations are presented as annual mean values from Annex II Table AII.1.1a.

{table:'Table_1_A_4}

{table:'Table_1_A_5}

TAR: The data were taken in 10-year increments from table Appendix II ({cite.1.'IPCC_2001}) SRES Data Tables Table II.2.1 (ISAM model high and low setting). The scenarios that give the upper bound or lower bound respectively vary over time.

AR4: The data used was obtained from Figure 10.26 in Chapter 10 of AR4 ({cite.1.'Meehl_et_al_2007}, provided by Malte Meinshausen). Annual means are used.

Data Processing

The projections have been harmonized to start from the observed value in 1990.

{table:'Table_1_A_6}

SAR: The data were taken in 5-year increments from {'Table_2_5 Table 2.5}a ({cite.1.'Schimel_et_al_1996}). The scenarios that give the upper bound or lower bound respectively vary over time.

TAR: The data were taken in 10-year increments from Appendix II SRES Data Tables Table II.2.2 ({cite.1.'IPCC_2001}). The upper bound is given by the A1p scenario, the lower bound by the B1p scenario.

AR4: The data used was obtained from Figure 10.26 in Chapter 10 of AR4 ({cite.1.'Meehl_et_al_2007}, provided by Malte Meinshausen). Annual means are used.

Data Processing

The observations are shown as annual means. The projections have been harmonized to start from the same value in 1990.

Data Processing

The observations are shown as annual means. No smoothing is applied. The projections have been harmonized to start from the same value in 1990.

Observed Global Mean Sea Level Rise

Three data sets based on {Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge} measurements are presented: {cite.1.'Church_and_White_2011 Church and White (2011)}, {cite.1.'Jevrejeva_et_al_2008 Jevrejeva et al. (2008)}, and {cite.1.'Ray_and_Douglas_2011 Ray and Douglas (2011)}. Annual mean anomalies are calculated relative to 1961–1990.

Estimates based on sea surface {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} are presented as the ensemble mean of five different data sets ({Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7}, {'Figure_3_13 Figure 3.13}, {Chapters.13.13_2 Section 13.2}, {'Figure_13_3 Figure 13.3}) from 1993 to 2012. Annual means have been calculated. The data are harmonized to start from the mean of the three tide gauge based estimates (see above) at 1993.

{table:'Table_1_A_8}

{table:'Table_1_A_9}

TAR: The data are given in Table II.5.1 in 10-year increments. They are harmonized to start from mean of the observed anomaly relative to 1961–1990 at 1990 (2.0 cm).

AR4: The AR4 did not give a time-dependent estimate of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise. These analyses have been conducted post AR4 by {cite.1.'Church_et_al_2011 Church et al. (2011)} based on the CMIP3 model results that were available at the time of AR4. Here, the SRES B1, A1B and A2 scenarios are shown from {cite.1.'Church_et_al_2011 Church et al. (2011)}. The data start in 2001 and are given as anomalies with respect to 1990. They are displayed from 2001 to 2035, but the anomalies are harmonized to start from mean of the observed anomaly relative to 1961–1990 at 1990 (2.0 cm).

Data Processing

The observations are shown from 1950 to 2012 as the annual mean anomaly relative to 1961–1990 (squares) and smoothed (solid lines). For smoothing, first, the trend of each of the observational data sets was calculated by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing ({cite.1.'Cleveland_1979}; f = 1/3). Then, the 11-year running means of the residuals were determined with reflected ends for the last 5 years. Finally, the trend was added back to the 11-year running means of the residuals.
