title: 1.4.1 - Uncertainty in Environmental Science

Model uncertainty is an important contributor to uncertainty in {Topics.*Climate_Predictions climate predictions} and projections. It includes, but is not restricted to, the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} introduced by errors in the model’s representation of dynamical and physical and bio-geochemical aspects of the climate system as well as in the model’s response to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing}. The phrase ‘model uncertainty’ is a common term in the climate change literature, but different studies use the phrase in different senses: some use it to represent the range of behaviours observed in ensembles of climate model (model spread), while others use it in more comprehensive senses (see Sections {Chapters.9.9_2 9.2}, {Chapters.11.11_2 11.2} and {Chapters.12.12_2 12.2}). {Glossary.*Model_spread Model spread} is often used as a measure of {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} uncertainty, but such a measure is crude as it takes no account of factors such as model quality ({Chapters.9 Chapter 9}) or model independence (e.g., {cite.1.'Masson_and_Knutti_2011}; {cite.1.'Pennell_and_Reichler_2011}), and not all variables of interest are adequately simulated by global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.

To maintain a degree of terminological clarity this report distinguishes between ‘model spread’ for this narrower representation of climate model responses and ‘model uncertainty’ which describes uncertainty about the extent to which any particular climate model provides an accurate representation of the real climate system. This uncertainty arises from approximations required in the development of models. Such approximations affect the representation of all aspects of the climate including the response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}.

Model uncertainty is sometimes decomposed further into parametric and structural uncertainty, comprising, respectively, uncertainty in the values of model parameters and uncertainty in the underlying model structure (see {Chapters.12.12_2 Section 12.2}). Some scientific research areas, such as {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} and observationally-constrained model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate}, incorporate significant elements of both observational and model-based science, and in these instances both sets of relevant uncertainties need to be incorporated.

Scenario uncertainty refers to the uncertainties that arise due to limitations in our understanding of future {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, concentration or forcing trajectories. Scenarios help in the assessment of future developments in complex systems that are either inherently unpredictable, or that have high scientific uncertainties ({cite.1.'IPCC_2000}). The societal choices defining future climate drivers are surrounded by considerable uncertainty, and these are explored by examining the climate response to a wide range of possible futures. In past reports, {Topics.*Scenarios emissions scenarios} from the SRES ({cite.1.'IPCC_2000}) were used as the main way of exploring uncertainty in future {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} climate drivers. Recent research has made use of {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways Representative Concentration Pathways} (RCP) (van Vuuren et al., 2011a, 2011b).

Internal or natural variability, the natural fluctuations in climate, occur in the absence of any RF of the Earth’s climate ({cite.1.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2009}). Climate varies naturally on nearly all time and space scales, and quantifying precisely the nature of this variability is challenging, and is characterized by considerable uncertainty. The analysis of internal and forced contributions to recent climate is discussed in {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}. The fractional contribution of {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} compared with other forms of uncertainty varies in time and in space, but usually diminishes with time as other sources of uncertainty become more significant ({cite.1.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2009}; see also {Chapters.11 Chapter 11} and {FAQ_1_1 FAQ 1.1}).

Science always involves uncertainties. These arise at each step of the scientific method: in the development of models or hypotheses, in measurements and in analyses and interpretation of scientific assumptions. Climate science is not different in this regard from other areas of science. The complexity of the climate system and the large range of processes involved bring particular challenges because, for example, gaps in direct measurements of the past can be filled only by reconstructions using {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} data.

Because the Earth’s climate system is characterized by multiple {Glossary.*Spatial_and_temporal_scales spatial and temporal scales}, uncertainties do not usually reduce at a single, predictable rate: for example, new observations may reduce the uncertainties surrounding short-timescale processes quite rapidly, while longer timescale processes may require very long observational baselines before much progress can be made. Characterization of the interaction between processes, as quantified by models, can be improved by model development, or can shed light on new areas in which uncertainty is greater than previously thought. The fact that there is only a single realization of the climate, rather than a range of different climates from which to draw, can matter significantly for certain lines of enquiry, most notably for the detection and attribution of causes of climate change and for the evaluation of projections of future states.
