title: 11.2.2.2 - Ensemble Generation

An {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} can be generated in many different ways and a wide range of methods have been explored in seasonal prediction (e.g., {cite.11.'Stockdale_et_al_1998}; {cite.11.'Stan_and_Kirtman_2008}) but not yet fully investigated for decadal prediction ({cite.11.'Corti_et_al_2012}). Methods being investigated include adding random perturbations to initial conditions, using atmospheric states displaced in time, using parallel assimilation runs ({cite.11.'DoblasReyes_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Du_et_al_2012}) and perturbing ocean initial conditions ({cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2007a}; {cite.11.'Mochizuki_et_al_2010}). Perturbations leading to rapidly growing modes, common in weather forecasting, have also been investigated ({cite.11.'Kleeman_et_al_2003}; {cite.11.'Vikhliaev_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2009}, 2011; {cite.11.'Du_et_al_2012}). The {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} associated with the limitations of a model’s representation of the climate system may be partially represented by perturbed physics ({cite.11.'Stainforth_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Murphy_et_al_2007}) or stochastic physics ({cite.11.'Berner_et_al_2008}), and applied to multi-annual and decadal {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2009; {cite.11.'Smith_et_al_2010}). {cite.11.'Weisheimer_et_al_2011 Weisheimer et al. (2011)} compare these three approaches in a seasonal prediction context.

The multi-model approach, which is used widely and most commonly, combines ensembles of predictions from a collection of models, thereby increasing the sampling of both initial conditions and model properties. Multi-model approaches are used across time scales ranging from seasonal–interannual (e.g., DEMETER; {cite.11.'Palmer_et_al_2004 Palmer et al. (2004)}, to seasonal-decadal (e.g., {cite.11.'Weisheimer_et_al_2011}; van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), in climate change simulation (e.g., {cite.11.'IPCC_2007}, {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}) and in the ENSEMBLES and CMIP5-based decadal predictions assessed in {Chapters.11.11_2.11_2_3 Section 11.2.3}. A problem with the multi-model approach is tha inter-dependence of the {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} used in current forecast systems (Power et al. 2012; Knutti et al. 2013) is expected to lead to co-dependence of forecast error.
