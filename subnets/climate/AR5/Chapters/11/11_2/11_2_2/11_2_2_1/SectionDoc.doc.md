title: 11.2.2.1 - Initial Conditions

A dynamical {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} consists of an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of forecasts produced by integrating a {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} forward in time from a set of observation-based initial conditions. As the forecast range increases, processes in the ocean become increasingly important and the sparseness, non-uniformity and secular change in sub-surface ocean observations is a challenge to analysis and prediction ({cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2009b}, 2013d; {cite.11.'Murphy_et_al_2010}) and can lead to differences among ocean analyses, that is, quantified descriptions of ocean initial conditions ({cite.11.'Stammer_2006}; {cite.11.'Keenlyside_and_Ba_2010}). Approaches to ocean initialization include (as listed in {'Table_11_1 Table 11.1}): assimilation only of SSTs to initialize the sub-surface ocean indirectly ({cite.11.'Keenlyside_et_al_2008}; Dunstone, 2010; {cite.11.'Swingedouw_et_al_2013}); the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} of the ocean model with atmospheric observations (e.g., {cite.11.'Du_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Matei_et_al_2012b}; {cite.11.'Yeager_et_al_2012}) and more sophisticated alternatives based on fully coupled data assimilation schemes (e.g., {cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2007a}; {cite.11.'Sugiura_et_al_2009}).

{cite.11.'Dunstone_and_Smith_2010 Dunstone and Smith (2010)} and {cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2010a Zhang et al. (2010a)} found an expected improvement in skill when sub-surface information was used as part of the initialization. Assimilation of atmospheric data, on the other hand, is expected to have little impact after the first few months ({cite.11.'Balmaseda_and_Anderson_2009}). The initialization of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, snow cover, frozen soil and {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} can potentially contribute to seasonal and subseasonal skill (e.g., {cite.11.'Koster_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Toyoda_et_al_2011}; Chevallier and Salas-Melia, 2012; {cite.11.'Paolino_et_al_2012}), although an assessment of their benefit at longer time scales has not yet been determined.
