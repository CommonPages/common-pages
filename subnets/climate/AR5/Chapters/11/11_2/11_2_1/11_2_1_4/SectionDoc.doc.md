title: 11.2.1.4 - Summary

{Glossary.*Predictability Predictability} studies suggest that initialized climate forecasts should be able to provide more detailed information on climate evolution, over a few years to a decade, than is available from uninitialized climate simulations alone. Predictability results are, however, based mainly on {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} results and depend on the verisimilitude with which the models reproduce climate system behaviour ({Chapters.9 Chapter 9}). There is evidence of multi-year predictability for both the internally generated and externally forced components of temperature over considerable portions of the globe with the first dominating at shorter and the second at longer time scales. Predictability for precipitation is based on fewer studies, is more modest than for temperature, and appears to be associated mainly with the forced component at longer time scales. Predictability can also vary from location to location.
