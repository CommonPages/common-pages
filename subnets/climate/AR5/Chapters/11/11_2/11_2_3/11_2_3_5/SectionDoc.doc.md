title: 11.2.3.5 - Realizing Potential

Although idealized {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} show considerable promise for predicting {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}, realizing this potential is a challenging task. There are three main hurdles: (1) the limited availability of data to initialize and verify {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions}, (2) limited progress in initialization techniques for decadal predictions and (3) dynamical model shortcomings that require validating how the simulated variance compares with the observed variance.

It is expected that the availability of temperature and salinity data in the top 2 km of the ocean through the enhanced global deployment of Argo floats will give a step change in our ability to initialize and predict ocean heat and density anomalies ({cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2007a}; {cite.11.'Dunstone_and_Smith_2010}). Another important advancement is the availability of highly accurate {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} data, made especially useful after the launching of TOPography EXperiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon in 1992. Argo and altimeter data became available only in 2000 and 1992 respectively, so an accurate estimate of their impact on real forecasts has to wait ({cite.11.'Dunstone_and_Smith_2010}). In all cases, both the length of the observational data sets and the reduced coverage of the data available, especially before 2000, are serious limitations to obtain robust estimates of forecast quality.

Improved initialization of other aspects such as {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, snow cover, frozen soil and {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}, may also have potential to contribute to predictive skill beyond the seasonal time scale. This could be investigated, for example by using measurements of soil moisture from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite launched in 2009, or by initializing sea ice thickness with observations from the CryoSat-2 satellite launched in 2010. Along the same line, understanding the links between the initialization and the correct prediction of both the internal and external variability should help improving forecast quality ({cite.11.'Solomon_et_al_2011}).

Many of the current decadal prediction systems use relatively simple initialization schemes and do not adopt fully coupled initialization/ {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} generation schemes. Assimilation schemes offer opportunities for fully coupled initialization including assimilation of variables such as sea ice, snow cover and soil moisture, although they present technically and scientifically challenging problems. This approach has been tested in schemes like four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR; {cite.11.'Sugiura_et_al_2008}) and the ensemble Kalman filter ({cite.11.'Keppenne_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2007a}).

Bias correction is used to reduce the effects of {Glossary.*Model_drift model drift}, but the {Glossary.*Nonlinearity nonlinearity} in the climate system (e.g., {cite.11.'Power_1995 Power (1995)} might limit the effectiveness of bias correction and thereby reduce forecast quality. Understanding and reducing both drift and systematic errors is important ({cite.11.'Palmer_and_Weisheimer_2011}), as it is also for seasonal-to-interannual {Glossary.*Climate_prediction climate prediction} and for climate change {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. While improving models is the highest priority, efforts to quantify the degree of interference between model bias and predictive signals should not be overlooked.
