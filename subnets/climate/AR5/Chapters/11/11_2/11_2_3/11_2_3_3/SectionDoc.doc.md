title: 11.2.3.3 - Pre-CMIP5 Decadal Prediction Experiments

Early decadal {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} studies found little additional predictive skill from initialization, over that due to changes in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF), on global ({cite.11.'Pierce_et_al_2004}) and regional scales ({cite.11.'Troccoli_and_Palmer_2007}). However, neither of these studies considered more than two start dates. More comprehensive tests, which considered at least nine different start dates indicated temperature skill ({cite.11.'Smith_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Keenlyside_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Pohlmann_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Sugiura_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Mochizuki_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Smith_et_al_2010}; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2011; Garcia-Serrano and Doblas-Reyes, 2012; Garcia-Serrano et al., 2012; {cite.11.'Kroger_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Matei_et_al_2012b}; van Oldenborgh et al., 2012; {cite.11.'Wu_and_Zhou_2012}; {cite.11.'MacLeod_et_al_2013}). Moreover, this skill was enhanced by initialization (local increase in correlation of 0.1 to 0.3, depending on the system) mostly over the ocean, in particular over the North Atlantic and subtropical Pacific oceans. Regions with skill improvements from initialization for precipitation are small and rarely statistically significant ({cite.11.'Goddard_et_al_2013}).
