title: 11.3.5 - Projections for Atmospheric Composition and Air Quality to 2100

The future evolution of atmospheric composition is determined by the chemical–physical processes in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, forced primarily by {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and by interactions with the {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere} and ocean (Chapters {Chapters.2}, {Chapters.6}, {Chapters.7}, {Chapters.8} and {Chapters.12}). Twenty-first century {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the chemically reactive {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, including methane ({Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}), nitrous oxide ({Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}) and ozone (O3), as well as aerosols, are assessed here ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_1 Section 11.3.5.1}). Future air pollution, specifically ground-level O3 and PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm, a measure of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} concentration), is also assessed here ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_2 Section 11.3.5.2}). The impact of changes in natural emissions and deposition through altered land use ({cite.11.'Heald_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Chen_et_al_2009a}; {cite.11.'Cook_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Wu_et_al_2012}) and production of food or biofuels ({Chapters.6 Chapter 6}) on atmospheric composition and air quality are not assessed here. Projected {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} abundances are discussed in Chapters {Chapters.6} and {Chapters.12}.

Projections for the 21st century are based predominantly on the CMIP5 models that included atmospheric chemistry and the related ACCMIP (Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project) models, driven by the RCP emission and {Topics.*Scenarios climate scenarios}. These and the earlier {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} include only direct anthropogenic emissions. Natural emissions may also change with biosphere feedbacks in response to climate or {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} ({Chapters.6 Chapter 6}, 8). Emphasis is placed on evaluating the 21st-century RCP scenarios from emissions to abundance, summarized in tables in Annex II. For the well-mixed greenhouse gases ({Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}), the effective {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF}) in both RCP and SRES scenarios increases similarly before 2040 with little spread (±16% in ERF; see Tables AII.6.1 to AII.6.10), but by 2050 the {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} scenario diverges, falling well below the envelope containing both the SRES and other RCP scenarios.

National and regional regulations implemented on emissions contributing to ground-level ozone and PM2.5 pollution influence global atmospheric chemistry and climate ({cite.11.'NRC_2009}; {cite.11.'HTAP_2010a}), as was recognized in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} ({cite.11.'Jacob_et_al_1993}; {cite.11.'Penner_et_al_1993}; {cite.11.'Johnson_et_al_1999}; {cite.11.'Prather_et_al_2001}). {Glossary.*Ozone Ozone} and aerosols are radiatively active species (Chapters {Chapters.7} and {Chapters.8}) and many of their {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} serve as indirect GHGs (e.g., nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), Non Methane {Glossary.*Volatile_Organic_Compounds Volatile Organic Compounds} (NMVOC)) by changing the atmospheric oxidative capacity, and thereby the lifetimes and abundances of CH4, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and tropospheric O3 ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}). Consequently their evolution can influence near-term climate both regionally and globally ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_1 Section 11.3.6.1} and {FAQ_8_2 FAQ 8.2}). The RCP and SRES scenarios differ greatly in terms of the short-lived air pollutants and aerosol climate forcing. The CMIP3 climate simulations driven by the SRES scenarios projected a wide range of future air pollutant trajectories, including unconstrained growth that resulted in very large tropospheric O3 increases ({cite.11.'Prather_et_al_2003}). Subsequently, the near-term projections of current legislation (CLE) and maximum feasible reductions (MFR) emissions illustrated the impacts of air pollution control strategies on air quality, global atmospheric chemistry and near-term climate ({cite.11.'Dentener_et_al_2005}, 2006; {cite.11.'Stevenson_et_al_2006}). The RCP scenarios applied in the CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} all assume a continuation of current trends in air pollution policies (van Vuuren et al., 2011) and thus do not cover the range of future pollutant emissions found in the literature, specifically those with higher pollutant emissions ({cite.11.'Dentener_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Kloster_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Pozzer_et_al_2012}); see {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}.

The new RCP emissions are compared to the older SRES and other published emission scenarios in Annex II (Tables AII.2.1 to AII.2.22) and {'Figure_8_2 Figures 8.2} and 8.SM.1. By 2030 the RCP aerosol and ozone precursor emissions are smaller than SRES by factors of 1.2 to 3. For these shortlived air pollutants, the spread across {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} by 2030 is much smaller than the range between the CLE and MFR scenarios: ±12% vs. ±31% for nitrogen oxides; ±17% vs. ±60% for sulphate; ±5% vs. ±11% for carbon monoxide. {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} aerosol emissions also vary little across the RCPs: ±4% range in 2030; ±15% in 2100. Most of this spread is due to uncertain projections for the rapidly industrializing nations. From 2000 to 2030, sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions decline in the RCPs by –15% to –8% per decade, within the range of the MFR and CLE scenarios (–23% to +2% per decade), but far below the SRES range (+4% to +21% per decade). Evaluation of recent trends in SO2 emissions shows a {Glossary.*Trend trend} similar to the near-term RCP projections ({cite.11.'Smith_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Klimont_et_al_2013}), but independent estimates for recent trends in other aerosol species are not available. The RCP trend in NOx emissions (–5% to +2% per decade) is likewise within the CLE-MFR range, but far below the SRES trends (+10% to +30% per decade). For OC and BC emissions, the RCP trend lies between the SRES B1/A2 range. A simple sum of the main four aerosol emissions (N, S, OC, BC; Tables AII.2.18 to AII.2.22) in the SRES vs. RCP scenarios indicates that the CMIP3 simulations driven by the SRES scenarios have about 40% more aerosols in 2000 than the CMIP5 simulations driven by the RCP scenarios. On average, these aerosols increase by 9% per decade in the SRES scenarios but decrease by 5% per decade in the RCP scenarios over the near term. By 2030, the CMIP3 models thus include up to three times more anthropogenic aerosols under the SRES scenarios than the CMIP5 models driven by the RCP scenarios (high confidence).
