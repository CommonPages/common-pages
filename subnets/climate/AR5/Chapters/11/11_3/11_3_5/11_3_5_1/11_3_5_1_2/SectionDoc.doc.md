title: 11.3.5.1.2 - Tropospheric and stratospheric O3

Projected O3 changes are broken into tropospheric and stratospheric columns (Dobson Unit ({Glossary.*Dobson_Unit DU}); see AII.5.1 and AII.5.2) because each has different driving factors and RF efficiencies ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}). Tropospheric O3 changes are driven by {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, NOx, CO, NMVOC (AII.2.2.16 to AII.2.2.18). Small changes (<10%) are projected over the next few decades. By 2100 tropospheric O3 decreases in {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, 4.5 and 6.0 but increases in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} due to CH4 increases. Higher tropospheric temperatures and humidity drive a decline in tropospheric O3, but stratospheric O3 recovery and increased {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}– {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} exchange can counter that ({cite.11.'Shindell_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Zeng_et_al_2008}, 2010; {cite.11.'Kawase_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}). The latter effect is difficult to quantify but it is included in some of the ACCMIP and CMIP5 models used to project tropospheric O3. Changes in natural emissions of NOx, particularly soil and lightning NOx, and biogenic NMVOC may also alter tropospheric O3 abundances ({cite.11.'Wild_2007}; {cite.11.'Wu_et_al_2007}). However, global estimates of their change with climate (e.g., {cite.11.'Kesik_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Monson_et_al_2007}; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2009; {cite.11.'Price_2013}) remain highly uncertain.

Best estimates for projected tropospheric O3 change following the RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} (Table AII.5.2) are based on ACCMIP time slice simulations for 2030 and 2100 with chemistry–{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.11.'Young_et_al_2013}) and the CMIP5 simulations (Eyring et al., 2013). There is high confidence in these results because similar estimates are obtained when {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} are made using the response of tropospheric O3 to key {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} factors that vary across scenarios ({cite.11.'Prather_et_al_2001}; {cite.11.'Stevenson_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Oman_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Wild_et_al_2012}). The ACCMIP models show a wide range in tropospheric O3 burden changes from 2000 to 2100: –5 DU (–15%) in RCP2.6 to +5 DU in RCP8.5. The CMIP5 results are similar but not identical: –3 DU (–9%) to +10 DU (+30%). The 2030 and 2100 multi-model mean estimates are more robust for ACCMIP which includes 5 to 11 models (range depends on time slice and scenario) than for CMIP5 (4 models). Tropospheric O3 changes in the near term (2030–2040) are small (±2 DU), except for RCP8.5 (>3 DU), which shows continued growth through to 2100 driven primarily by CH4 increases. The {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} from tropospheric O3 changes (AII.6.7b) parallels the O3 burden change ({cite.11.'Stevenson_et_al_2013}).

Stratospheric O3 is being driven by declining chlorine levels, changing {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} and CH4, cooler temperatures from increased {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, and a more vigorous overturning circulation in the stratosphere driven by more wave propagation under climate change ({cite.11.'Butchart_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Eyring_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Oman_et_al_2010}). Overall stratospheric O3 is expected to increase in the coming decades, reversing the majority of the loss that occurred between 1980 and 2000. Best estimates for global mean stratospheric O3 change under the RCP scenarios (Table AII.5.1) are taken from the CMIP5 results (Eyring et al., 2013). By 2100 stratospheric O3 columns show a 5 to 7% increase above 2000 levels for all {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}, recovering to within 1% of the pre-{Glossary.*Ozone ozone} hole 1980 levels by 2050, but with latitudinal differences.
