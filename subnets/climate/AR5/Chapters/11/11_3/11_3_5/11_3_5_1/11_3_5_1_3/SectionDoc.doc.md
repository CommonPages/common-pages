title: 11.3.5.1.3 - Aerosols

{Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} species can be emitted directly (mineral dust, sea salt, {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} and some organic carbon (OC)) or indirectly through precursor gases (SO2, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons); see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}. CMIP5 models ({cite.11.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Shindell_et_al_2013}) have {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} changes in aerosol burden (Tg) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) to year 2100 using RCP {Topics.*Emissions emissions} for {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Source source} (Tables AII.5.3 to AII.5.8). Total AOD is dominated by dust and sea salt, but absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) is primarily of anthropogenic origin ({Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). Uniformly, anthropogenic aerosols decrease under {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} as expected from the declining emissions (11.3.5, {'Figure_8_2 Figure 8.2}, AII.2.17 to AII.2.22). From years 2010 to 2030 the aerosol {Glossary.*Burden burdens} decrease across the RCPs but at varied rates: for sulphate from 6% ({Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}) to 23% ({Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}); for BC from 5% (RCP4.5) to 15% (RCP2.6), and for OC from 0% (RCP6.0) to 11% (RCP4.5). The summed aerosol loading of these three anthropogenic components drop from year 2010 to year 2030 by 5% to 12% (across RCPs), and by year 2100 this drop is 24% to 39% (Tables AII.5.5 to AII.5.7). These evolving aerosol loadings reduce the magnitude of the negative aerosol {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}; Table AII.6.9) even in the near term (11.3.6.1).
