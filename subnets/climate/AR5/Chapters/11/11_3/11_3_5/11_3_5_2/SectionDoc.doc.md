title: 11.3.5.2 - Projections of Air Quality for the 21st Century

Future air quality depends on anthropogenic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (local, regional and global), natural biogenic emissions and the physical climate (e.g., {cite.11.'Steiner_et_al_2006}, 2010; {cite.11.'Meleux_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Tao_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Wu_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Doherty_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Carlton_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Tai_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Hoyle_et_al_2011}). This assessment focuses on O3 and PM2.5 in surface air, reflecting the preponderance of published literature and multi-model assessments for these air pollutants (e.g., {cite.11.'HTAP_2010a}) plus the chemistryâ€“climate CMIP5 and ACCMIP model simulations. Nitrogen and acid deposition is addressed in {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}. Toxic atmospheric species such as mercury and persistent organic pollutants are outside this assessment ({cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009}; {cite.11.'NRC_2009}; {cite.11.'HTAP_2010b}, 2010c).

The global and continental-scale surface O3 and PM2.5 changes assessed here include (1) the impact of climate change ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_2.11_3_5_2_1 Section 11.3.5.2.1}), and (2) the impact of changing global and regional anthropogenic emissions ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_2.11_3_5_2_2 Section 11.3.5.2.2}). Changes in local emissions within a metropolitan {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} or surrounding air basin on local air quality {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} are not assessed here. {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} emissions of O3 {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} include NOx, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, CO, and NMVOC; PM2.5 is both directly emitted (OC, {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}) and produced photochemically from precursor emissions (NOx, NH3, SO2, NMVOC) (see Tables AII.2.2,16-22). Recent reviews describe the impact of temperature-driven processes on O3 and PM2.5 air quality from observational and modelling evidence ({cite.11.'Isaksen_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009}; {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012}). Projecting future air quality empirically from a mean surface warming using the observed correlation with temperature is problematic, as there is little evidence that future pollution episodes can be simply modelled as all else being equal except for a uniform temperature shift. Air quality relationships with synoptic conditions may be more robust (e.g., {cite.11.'Dharshana_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Appelhans_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Tai_et_al_2012a}, 2012b), but require the ability to project changes in key conditions such as {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} and stagnation episodes. The response of blocking frequency to global warming is complex, with summertime increases possible over some regions, but models are generally biased compared to observed blocking statistics, and indicate even larger {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in projecting changes in blocking intensity and persistence ({Box_14_2 Box 14.2}).
