title: 11.3.5.2.3 - Extreme weather and air pollution

Extreme air quality episodes are associated with changing weather patterns, such as heat waves and stagnation episodes ({cite.11.'Logan_1989}; {cite.11.'Vukovich_1995}; {cite.11.'Cox_and_Chu_1996}; {cite.11.'Mickley_et_al_2004}; {cite.11.'Stott_et_al_2004}). Heat waves are generally associated with poor air quality (Ordóñez et al., 2005; {cite.11.'Vautard_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Lee_et_al_2006b}; {cite.11.'Struzewska_and_Kaminski_2008}; {cite.11.'Tressol_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Vieno_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Hodnebrog_et_al_2012}). Although {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} climate change has increased the near-term risk of such heat waves ({cite.11.'Stott_et_al_2004}; {cite.11.'Clark_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Diffenbaugh_and_Ashfaq_2010}; {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}; {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_5.11_3_2_5_1 Section 11.3.2.5.1}), projected changes in the frequency of regional air stagnation events, which are largely driven by {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} events, remain difficult to assess: the frequency of blocking events with persistent high pressure is projected to decrease in a warming climate but increases may occur in some regions, and projected changes in their intensity and duration remain uncertain (Chapters {Chapters.9} and {Chapters.14}; {Box_14_2 Box 14.2}). Projections in regional air pollution extremes are necessarily conditioned on projected changes in these weather patterns. The severity of extreme pollution events also depends on local {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (see references in {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012}). Feedbacks from vegetation (higher biogenic NMVOC emissions, lower stomatal {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of O3 with higher temperatures) can combine with similar positive feedbacks via dust and wildfires to worsen air pollution and its impacts during heat waves ({cite.11.'Lee_et_al_2006a}; {cite.11.'Jiang_et_al_2008}; Royal Society, 2008; {cite.11.'Flannigan_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Andersson_and_Engardt_2010}; {cite.11.'Vieno_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Hodnebrog_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Jaffe_and_Wigder_2012}; {cite.11.'Mues_et_al_2012}).

There is high agreement across numerous modelling studies projecting increases in extreme O3 pollution events over the USA and Europe, but the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} do not consistently agree at the regional level ({cite.11.'Kleeman_2008}; {cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009}; {cite.11.'Jacobson_and_Streets_2009}; {cite.11.'Weaver_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Huszar_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Katragkou_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Langner_et_al_2012b}) because they depend on accurate projections of local emissions, {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} and poorly understood biospheric feedbacks. Although observational evidence clearly demonstrates a strong statistical correlation between extreme temperatures (heat waves) and pollution events, this temperature correlation reflects in part the coincident occurrence of stagnation events and clear skies that also drive extreme pollution. Mechanistic understanding of biogenic emissions, deposition and atmospheric chemistry is consistent with a temperature-driven increase in pollution extremes in already polluted regions, although these processes may not scale simply with mean temperature under a changing climate (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_2.11_3_5_2_1 Section 11.3.5.2.1}), and better projections of the changing meteorology at regional scales are needed. Assuming all else is equal (e.g., local anthropogenic emissions) this collective evidence indicates that uniformly higher temperatures in polluted environments will trigger regional feedbacks during air stagnation episodes that will increase peak pollution (medium confidence).
