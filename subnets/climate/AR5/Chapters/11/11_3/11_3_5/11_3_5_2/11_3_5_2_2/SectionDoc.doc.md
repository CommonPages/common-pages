title: 11.3.5.2.2 - Changes driven by regional and global anthropogenic pollutant emissions

Projections for annual-mean surface O3 and PM2.5 for 2000 through 2100 are shown in Figures 11.23a and 11.25b, respectively. Changes are spatially averaged over selected world (land-only) regions and include the combined effects of emission and climate changes under the {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}. Results are taken from the ACCMIP models and a subset of the CMIP5 models that included atmospheric chemistry. Large interannual variations are evident in the CMIP5 transient simulations, and large regional variations occur in both the CMIP5 and the ACCMIP decadal time slice simulations (see Lamarque et al., (2013) for ACCMIP overview).

The largest surface O3 changes under the RCP scenarios are much smaller than those projected under the older {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} (Figures 11.22 and 11.23a; Table AII.7; {cite.11.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Wild_et_al_2012}). By 2100, global annual multi-model mean surface O3 rises by 12 ppb in SRES A2, but by only 3 ppb in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}. Much larger O3 decreases are projected to occur by 2030 under the MFR scenario ({'Figure_11_22 Figure 11.22}), which assumes that existing control technologies are applied uniformly across the globe ({cite.11.'Dentener_et_al_2006}).

For {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, {Glossary.*RCP4_5_and_RCP6_0 RCP4.5 and RCP6.0}, the CMIP5/ACCMIP models project that continental-scale spatially averaged near-term surface O3 decreases or changes little (–4 to +1 ppb) from 2000 to 2030 for all regions except South Asia, whereas the long-term change to 2100 is a consistent decrease (–14 to –3 ppb) for all regions (Figure 11.23a; and Table AII.7.3). For RCP8.5, the CMIP5/ACCMIP models project continental-scale spatial average surface O3 increases of up to +5 ppb for both 2030 and 2100 (Figure 11.23a; Table AII.7.3). The increases under RCP8.5 reflect the prominent rise in methane abundances ({cite.11.'Kawase_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Wild_et_al_2012}), which by 2100 raise background O3 levels by 5 to 14 ppb over continental-scale regions, and on average by about 8 ppb (25% above current levels) above RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 which include more stable methane pathways over the 21st century (high confidence). Earlier studies have shown that rising {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} abundances (and global NOx {Topics.*Emissions emissions}) increase baseline O3, and can offset aggressive local emission reductions and lengthen the O3 pollution season ({cite.11.'Jacob_et_al_1999}; {cite.11.'Prather_et_al_2001}, 2003; {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2002}, 2009; {cite.11.'Hogrefe_et_al_2004}; {cite.11.'Granier_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Szopa_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Tao_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Huang_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Lin_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Wu_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Avise_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Chen_et_al_2009b};{cite.11.'HTAP_2010a}; {cite.11.'Wild_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Lei_et_al_2013}).

The O3 changes driven by the RCP {Topics.*Scenarios emissions scenarios} with fixed, present-day climate ({'Figure_11_22 Figure 11.22}; {cite.11.'Wild_et_al_2012}) are similar to the changes estimated with the full chemistry–{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} (Figure 11.23a). Although the regions considered are not identical, the evidence supports a major role for global emissions in determining nearterm O3 concentrations. Overall, the multi-model ranges associated with the influence of near-term climate change on global and regional O3 air quality are smaller than those across emission scenarios ({'Figure_11_22 Figure 11.22}; {cite.11.'HTAP_2010a}; {cite.11.'Wild_et_al_2012}).

{Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} changes driven by {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions depend somewhat on oxidant levels (e.g., {cite.11.'Unger_et_al_2006a}; {cite.11.'Kleeman_2008}; {cite.11.'Leibensperger_et_al_2011a}), but generally sulphate follows SO2 emissions and carbonaceous aerosols follow the primary elemental and OC emissions. Competition between sulphate and nitrate for ammonium (see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}) means that reducing SO2 emissions while increasing NH3 emissions as in the RCPs (Tables AII.2.19 and AII.2.20) would lead to near-term nitrate aerosol levels equal to or higher than those of sulphate in some regions; see {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_5.7_3_5_2 Section 7.3.5.2} ({cite.11.'Bauer_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Pye_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Bellouin_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Henze_et_al_2012}).

Regional PM2.5 in the CMIP5 and ACCMIP chemistry–climate models following the RCP scenarios generally declines over the 21st century, with little difference across the individual scenarios except for the South and East Asia regions (Figure 11.23b). The noisy {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} over Africa, the Middle East and to some extent Australia, reflect dust sources and their strong dependence on interannual meteorological variability. Over the two Asian regions, different PM2.5 levels between the RCPs are due to (1) OC emission trajectories over South Asia and (2) combined changes in {Glossary.*Carbonaceous_aerosol carbonaceous aerosol} and SO2 over East Asia ({cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012}) (Figure 8.SM.1).

Global emissions of aerosols and {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} can contribute to high-PM events. For example, dust trans-oceanic transport events are observed to increase aerosols in downwind regions ({cite.11.'Prospero_1999}; {cite.11.'Grousset_et_al_2003}; {cite.11.'Chin_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Fairlie_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Huang_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Liu_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Ramanathan_and_Feng_2009}; {cite.11.'HTAP_2010a}). The balance between regional and global anthropogenic emissions versus climate-driven changes for PM2.5 will vary regionally with future changes in precipitation, wildfires, dust and biogenic emissions.

In summary, lower air pollution levels are projected following the RCP emissions as compared to the SRES emissions in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} and {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, reflecting implementation of air pollution control measures (high confidence). The range in projections of air quality is driven primarily by emissions (including CH4) rather than by physical climate change (medium confidence). The total emission-driven range in air quality— including the CLE and MFR scenarios—is larger than that spanned by the RCPs (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_1 Section 11.3.5.1} for comparison of RCPs and SRES).
