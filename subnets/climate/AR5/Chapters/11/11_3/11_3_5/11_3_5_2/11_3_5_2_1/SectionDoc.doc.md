title: 11.3.5.2.1 - Climate-driven changes

Projecting regional air quality faces the challenge of simulating first the changes in {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} and then the feedbacks from atmospheric chemistry and the {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere}. The air pollution response to climate-driven changes in the biosphere is uncertain as to sign because of competing effects: for example, plants currently emit more NMVOC with warmer temperatures; with higher {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and water stress plants may emit less; with a warmer climate the vegetation types may shift to emit either more or less NMVOC; shifting vegetation types may also alter surface {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of ozone and aerosols; and our understanding of chemical oxidation pathways for biogenic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} is incomplete (e.g., {cite.11.'Monson_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Carlton_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Hallquist_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Ito_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Pacifico_et_al_2009}, 2012; {cite.11.'Paulot_et_al_2009}). Although studies have split the cause of air quality changes into climate versus emissions, these attributions are difficult to assess for several reasons: the global-to-regional down-scaling of meteorology that is model dependent (see Chapters {Chapters.9} and {Chapters.14}; also {cite.11.'Manders_et_al_2012}), the brief simulations that preclude clear separation of climate change from {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({cite.11.'Nolte_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Langner_et_al_2012a}), and the lack of systematically explored standard {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} for local {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions, {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} and biogenic emissions.

{Glossary.*Ozone Ozone}

Globally, a warming climate decreases baseline surface O3 almost everywhere but increases O3 levels in some polluted regions and seasons. The surface ozone response to climate change alone between 2000 and 2030 is shown in {'Figure_11_22 Figure 11.22} (CLIMATE), where the ranges reflect multi-model differences in spatial averages (solid green lines) and spatial variability within a single model (dashed green lines). There is high confidence that in unpolluted regions, higher water vapour abundances and temperatures enhance O3 destruction, leading to lower baseline O3 levels in a warmer climate (e.g., global average in {'Figure_11_22 Figure 11.22}). Higher {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} levels such as in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} can offset this climate-driven decrease in baseline O3. Other large-scale factors that could increase baseline O3 in a warming climate include increased lightning NOx and stratospheric influx of O3 (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_1 Section 11.3.5.1}). Evidence and agreement are limited regarding the impact of climate change on long-range transport of pollutants ({cite.11.'Wu_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'HTAP_2010a}; {cite.11.'Doherty_et_al_2013}). The global chemistry-{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} assessed here ({'Figure_11_22 Figures 11.22}, 11.23ab) include most of these {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} processes, but a systematic evaluation of their relative impacts is lacking.

In polluted regions, observations show that high-O3 episodes correlate with high temperatures (e.g., {cite.11.'Lin_et_al_2001}; {cite.11.'Bloomer_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Rasmussen_et_al_2012}), but these episodes also coincide with cloud-free enhanced photochemistry and with air stagnation that concentrates pollution near the surface (e.g., {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} Box 7.4). Other temperature-related factors, such as biogenic emissions from vegetation and soils, volatilization of NMVOC, thermal decomposition of organic nitrates to NOx and wildfire frequency may increase with a warming climate and are expected to increase surface O3 (e.g., {cite.11.'Doherty_et_al_2013}; Skjøth and Geels, 2013; and as reviewed by {cite.11.'Isaksen_et_al_2009 Isaksen et al. (2009)}, {cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009 Jacob and Winner (2009)} and {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012 Fiore et al. (2012)}), although some of these processes are known to have optimal temperature ranges (e.g., {cite.11.'Sillman_and_Samson_1995}; {cite.11.'Guenther_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Steiner_et_al_2010}). Overall, the integrated effect of these processes on O3 remains poorly understood, and they have been implemented with varying levels of complexity in the models assessed here.

Models show that a warmer {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} can lead to local O3 increases during the peak pollution season (e.g., by 2 to 6 ppb within Central Europe by 2030; green dashed line for Europe in {'Figure_11_22 Figure 11.22}). Regional models projecting summer daytime statistics tend to simulate a wider range of climate-driven changes (e.g., {cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Avise_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Kelly_et_al_2012}), with most studies focusing on 2050 ({cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012}) or beyond. For example, summer {Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} over parts of Europe are projected to warm more than the corresponding mean local temperatures due to enhanced variability at interannual to intraseasonal time scales (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_3 Section 12.4.3.3}). Several modelling studies note a longer season for O3 pollution in a warmer world ({cite.11.'Nolte_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Racherla_and_Adams_2008}). For some regions, models agree on the sign of the O3 response to a warming climate (e.g., increases in northeastern USA and southern Europe; decreases in northern Europe), but they often disagree (e.g., the midwest, southeast, and western USA ({cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009}; {cite.11.'Weaver_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Langner_et_al_2012a}; {cite.11.'Langner_et_al_2012b}; {cite.11.'Manders_et_al_2012})). Several studies have suggested a role for changing synoptic meteorology on future air pollution levels ({cite.11.'Leibensperger_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009}; {cite.11.'Weaver_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Lang_and_Waugh_2011}; {cite.11.'Tai_et_al_2012a}, 2012b; {cite.11.'Turner_et_al_2013}), but projected regional changes in synoptic conditions are uncertain (see Sections {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4 11.3.2.4} {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_3 12.4.3.3} and {Box_14_2 Box 14.2}). Observational and modelling evidence together indicate that, all else being equal, a warming climate is expected to increase surface O3 in polluted regions (medium confidence), although a systematic evaluation of all the factors driving extreme pollution episodes is lacking.

Aerosols

Evaluations as to whether climate change will worsen or improve {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} pollution are model-dependent. Assessments are confounded by opposing influences on the individual species contributing to total PM2.5 and large interannual variability caused by the small-scale meteorology (e.g., {Glossary.*Convection convection} and precipitation) that controls aerosol concentrations ({cite.11.'Mahmud_et_al_2010}). For a full discussion, see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}. Higher temperatures generally decrease nitrate aerosol through enhanced volatility but increase sulphate aerosol through faster production, although observed PM2.5–temperature correlations also reflect humidity and synoptic meteorology (e.g., {cite.11.'Aw_and_Kleeman_2003}; {cite.11.'Liao_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Racherla_and_Adams_2006}; {cite.11.'Unger_et_al_2006a}; {cite.11.'Hedegaard_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Jacobson_2008}; {cite.11.'Kleeman_2008}; {cite.11.'Pye_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Tai_et_al_2012b}). Natural aerosols may increase with temperature, particularly {Glossary.*Carbonaceous_aerosol carbonaceous aerosol} from wildfires, mineral dust, and biogenic secondary {Glossary.*Organic_aerosol organic aerosol} (SOA; {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_5 Section 7.3.5}; {cite.11.'Mahowald_and_Luo_2003}; {cite.11.'Tegen_et_al_2004}; {cite.11.'Jickells_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Woodward_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Mahowald_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Liao_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Mahowald_2007}; {cite.11.'Tagaris_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Heald_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Spracklen_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Jiang_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Yue_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Carvalho_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2012}). SOA formation also depends on anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric oxidizing capacity ({cite.11.'Carlton_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Jiang_et_al_2010}).

Aerosols are scavenged from the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} by precipitation and direct deposition (see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). Hence most components of PM2.5 are anti-correlated with precipitation ({cite.11.'Tai_et_al_2010}), and aerosol {Glossary.*Burden burdens} are expected to decrease on average where precipitation increases ({cite.11.'Racherla_and_Adams_2006}; {cite.11.'Liao_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Tagaris_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Avise_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Pye_et_al_2009}). However, a shift in the frequency and type of precipitation may be as important as the change in mean precipitation (see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). Seasonal and regional differences in aerosol burdens versus precipitation further preclude a simple scaling of aerosol response to precipitation changes ({cite.11.'Kloster_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Fang_et_al_2011}). Climate-driven changes in the frequency of drizzle and the mixing depths or {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation} of the {Glossary.*Surface_layer surface layer} also influence projected changes in PM2.5 (e.g., {cite.11.'Kleeman_2008}; {cite.11.'Dawson_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Jacob_and_Winner_2009}; {cite.11.'Mahmud_et_al_2010}), and aerosols in turn can influence locally clouds, precipitation and scavenging (e.g., {cite.11.'Zhang_et_al_2010b}; see {Chapters.7.7_6 Section 7.6}).

While PM2.5 is expected to decrease in regions where precipitation increases, the climate variability at these scales results in only low confidence for {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} at best. Further, consensus is lacking on the other factors including climate-driven changes in biogenic and mineral dust aerosols, leading to no confidence level being attached to the overall impact of climate change on PM2.5 distributions.
