title: 11.3.4.2 - Snow Cover

Decreases of {Glossary.*Snow_cover_extent snow cover extent} (SCE, defined over ice-free land areas) are strongly connected to a shortening of seasonal snow cover duration ({cite.11.'Brown_and_Mote_2009}) and are related to both precipitation and temperature changes (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_2 Section 12.4.6.2}). This has implications for snow on {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} where loss of sea ice area in autumn delays snowfall {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation}, with CMIP5 multi-model mean values of snow depth in April north of 70°N reduced from about 28 cm to roughly 18 cm for the 2031–2050 period compared to the 1981–2000 average ({cite.11.'Hezel_et_al_2012}). The snow accumulation season by mid-century in one model is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} to begin later in autumn, with the melt season initiated earlier in the spring ({cite.11.'Lawrence_and_Slater_2010}). As discussed in greater detail in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_2 Section 12.4.6.2}, projected increases in snowfall across much of the northern high latitudes act to increase snow amounts, but warming reduces the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow. In addition, the reduction of Arctic sea ice also provides an increased moisture {Glossary.*Source source} for snowfall ({cite.11.'Liu_et_al_2012}). Whether the average SCE decreases or increases by mid-century depends on the balance between these competing factors. The dividing line where models transition from simulating increasing or decreasing maximum {Glossary.*Snow_water_equivalent snow water equivalent} roughly coincides with the –20°C isotherm in the mid-20th century November to March mean surface air temperature ({cite.11.'Raisanen_2008}). The projected change of SCE over some regions is inconsistent with that of extreme snowfall, a major contributor to SCE. For instance, SCE is projected to decrease over northern China by the mid-21st century ({cite.11.'Shi_et_al_2011}), while the extreme snowfall events over the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} are projected to increase ({cite.11.'Sun_et_al_2010}).

Time series of projected changes in relative SCE (for NH ice-free land areas) are shown in {'Figure_12_32 Figure 12.32}. Multi-model averages from the CMIP5 archive (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013) show percentage decreases of NH SCE ± 1 standard deviation for the 2016–2035 time period for a March to April average using a 15% extent threshold for the four RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} as follows: {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}: –5.2% ± 1.9% (21 models); RCP4.5: –5.3% ± 1.5% (24 models); RCP6.0: –4.5% ± 1.2% (16 models); {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}: –6.0% ± 2.0% (24 models).
