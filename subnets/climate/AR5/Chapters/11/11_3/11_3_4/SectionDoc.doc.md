title: 11.3.4 - Near-term Projected Changes in the Cryosphere

This section assesses projected near-term changes of elements of the {Topics.*Climate_System cryosphere}. These consist of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, snow cover and near-surface {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} ({Glossary.*Frozen_ground frozen ground}), changes to the Arctic Ocean and possible abrupt changes involving the {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}. Glaciers and ice sheets are addressed in {Chapters.13 Chapter 13}. Here near-term changes in the geographical coverage of sea ice, snow cover and {Glossary.*Near_surface_permafrost near-surface permafrost} are assessed.

Trends due to changes in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} exist alongside considerable interannual and decadal variability. This complicates our ability to make specific, precise short-term {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, and delays the emergence of a forced signal above the noise.
