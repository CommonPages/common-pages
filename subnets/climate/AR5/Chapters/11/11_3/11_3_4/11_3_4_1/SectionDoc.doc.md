title: 11.3.4.1 - Sea Ice

Though most of the CMIP5 models project a nearly ice-free Arctic ({Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} extent less than 1 × 106 km2 for at least 5 consecutive years) at the end of summer by 2100 in the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1}), some show large changes in the near term as well. Some previous models project an ice-free summer period in the Arctic Ocean by 2040 ({cite.11.'Holland_et_al_2006}), and even as early as the late 2030s using a criterion of 80% sea ice area loss (e.g., {cite.11.'Zhang_2010}). By scaling six CMIP3 models to recent observed September sea ice changes, a nearly ice-free Arctic in September is projected to occur by 2037, reaching the first quartile of the distribution for timing of September sea ice loss by 2028 ({cite.11.'Wang_and_Overland_2009}). However, a number of models that have fairly thick Arctic sea ice produce a slower near-term decrease in sea ice extent compared to observations ({cite.11.'Stroeve_et_al_2007}). Based on a linear extrapolation into the future of the recent sea ice volume {Glossary.*Trend trend} from a hindcast simulation conducted with a regional model of the Arctic sea ice–ocean system ({cite.11.'Maslowski_et_al_2012}) projected that it would take only until about 2016 to reach a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer. However, such an approach not only neglects the effect of year-to-year or longer-term variability ({cite.11.'Overland_and_Wang_2013}) but also ignores the negative feedbacks that can occur when the sea ice cover becomes thin ({cite.11.'Notz_2009}). {cite.11.'Mahlstein_and_Knutti_2012 Mahlstein and Knutti (2012)} estimated the annual mean global surface warming threshold for nearly ice-free Arctic conditions in September to be ~2°C above the present derived from both CMIP3 models and observations.

An analysis of CMIP3 model simulations indicates that for near-term {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} the dominant factor for decreasing sea ice is increased ice melt, and reductions in ice growth play a secondary role ({cite.11.'Holland_et_al_2010}). Arctic sea ice has larger volume loss when there is thicker ice initially across the CMIP3 models, with a projected accumulated mass loss of about 0.5 m by 2020, and roughly 1.0 m by 2050, with considerable {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} ({cite.11.'Holland_et_al_2010}). The CMIP3 models tended to under-estimate the observed rapid decline of summer Arctic sea ice during the satellite era, but these recent trends are more accurately simulated in the CMIP5 models (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1}). For CMIP3 models, results indicate that the changes in Arctic sea ice mass budget over the 21st century are related to the late 20th century mean sea ice thickness distribution ({cite.11.'Holland_et_al_2010}), average sea ice thickness ({cite.11.'Bitz_2008}; {cite.11.'Hodson_et_al_2012}), fraction of thin ice cover ({cite.11.'Boe_et_al_2009}) and oceanic heat transport to the Arctic ({cite.11.'Mahlstein_et_al_2011}). Acceleration of sea ice drift observed over the last three decades, underestimated in CMIP3 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({cite.11.'Rampal_et_al_2011}), and the presence of fossil-fuel and biofuel soot in the Arctic environment ({cite.11.'Jacobson_2010}), could also contribute to ice-free late summer conditions over the Arctic in the near term. Details on the transition to an ice-free summer over the Arctic are presented in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12} (Sections {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 12.4.6.1} and {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_7 12.5.5.7}).

The discussion in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1} makes the case for assessing nearterm projections of Arctic sea ice by weighting/recalibrating the models based on their present-day Arctic sea ice simulations, with a credible underlying physical basis in order to increase confidence in the results, and accounting for the potentially large imprint of natural variability on both observations and model simulations (see {Chapters.9.9_8.9_8_3 Section 9.8.3}). A subselection of a set of CMIP5 models that fits those criteria, following the methodology proposed by {cite.11.'Massonnet_et_al_2012 Massonnet et al. (2012)}, is applied in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12} ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1}) to the full set of models that provided the CMIP5 database with sea ice output. Among the five selected models, four project a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September (sea ice extent less than 1 × 106 km2 for at least 5 consecutive years) before 2050 for RCP8.5, the earliest and latest years of near disappearance of the sea ice pack being about 2040 and about 2060, respectively. The potential {Glossary.*Irreversibility irreversibility} of the Arctic sea ice loss and the possibility of an abrupt transition toward an ice-free Arctic Ocean are discussed in {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_7 Section 12.5.5.7}.

In light of all these results and others discussed in greater detail in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1}, it is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin all year round during the 21st century as the annual mean global {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} rises. It is also likely that the Arctic Ocean will become nearly ice-free in September before the middle of the century for high GHG {Topics.*Emissions emissions} such as those corresponding to RCP8.5 (medium confidence).

In early 21st century simulations, Antarctic sea ice cover is projected to decrease in the CMIP5 models, though CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate recent decreases in Antarctic sea ice extent compared to slight increases in the observations ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1}). However, there is the possibility that melting of the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} could be changing the vertical ocean temperature stratification around Antarctica and encourage sea ice growth ({cite.11.'Bintanja_et_al_2013}). This and other evidence discussed in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1} leads to the assessment that there is low confidence in Antarctic sea ice model projections that show near-term decreases of sea ice cover because of the wide range of model responses and the inability of almost all of the models to reproduce the mean seasonal cycle, interannual variability and overall increase of the Antarctic sea ice areal coverage observed during the satellite era (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3}).
