  |It is very likely that the Arctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} cover will continue to shrink and thin all year round during the 21st century. It is also likely that the Arctic Ocean will become nearly ice-free in September before the middle of the century for high GHG {Topics.*Emissions emissions} such as those corresponding to {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}. Virtually all near-term {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} indicate a substantial amount of near-surface {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} degradation, and thaw depth deepening over much of the permafrost area.
