title: 11.3.6 - Additional Uncertainties in Projections of Near-term Climate

As discussed in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_1 Section 11.3.1}, most of the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} presented in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2 Section 11.3.2} to 11.3.4 are based on the RCP4.5 scenario and rely on the spread among the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of opportunity as an ad hoc measure of uncertainty. It is possible that the real world might follow a path outside (above or below) the range projected by the CMIP5 models. Such an eventuality could arise if there are processes operating in the real world that are missing from, or inadequately represented in, the models. Two main possibilities must be considered: (1) Future radiative and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} may diverge from the RCP4.5 scenario and, more generally, could fall outside the range of all the RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}; (2) The response of the real climate system to radiative and other forcing may differ from that projected by the CMIP5 models. A third possibility is that internal fluctuations in the real climate system are inadequately simulated in the models. The fidelity of the CMIP5 models in simulating internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} is discussed in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}.

Future changes in RF will be caused by {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural processes. The consequences for near-term climate of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in anthropogenic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and land use are discussed in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_1 Section 11.3.6.1}. The uncertainties in natural RF that are most important for near-term climate are those associated with future volcanic eruptions and variations in the radiation received from the Sun (solar output), and are discussed in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_2 Section 11.3.6.2}. In addition, {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} and other biogeochemical feedbacks in a warming climate could potentially lead to abundances of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} (and hence RF) outside the range of the RCP scenarios, but these feedbacks are not expected to play a major role in near term climate—see Chapters {Chapters.6} and {Chapters.12} for further discussion.

The response of the climate system to radiative and other forcing is influenced by a very wide range of processes, not all of which are adequately simulated in the CMIP5 models ({Chapters.9 Chapter 9}). Of particular concern for projections are mechanisms that could lead to major ‘surprises’ such as an abrupt or rapid change that affects global-to-continental scale climate. Several such mechanisms are discussed in this assessment report; these include: rapid changes in the Arctic ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_4 Section 11.3.4} and {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}), rapid changes in the ocean’s overturning circulation ({Chapters.12 Chapter 12}), rapid change of ice sheets ({Chapters.13 Chapter 13}) and rapid changes in regional {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} systems and hydrological climate ({Chapters.14 Chapter 14}). Additional mechanisms may also exist as synthesized in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}. These mechanisms have the potential to influence climate in the near term as well as in the long term, albeit the {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of substantial impacts increases with global warming and is generally lower for the near term. {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_3 Section 11.3.6.3} provides an overall assessment of projections for global mean surface air temperature, taking into account all known quantifiable uncertainties.
