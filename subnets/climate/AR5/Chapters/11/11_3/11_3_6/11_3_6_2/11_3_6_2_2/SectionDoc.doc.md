title: 11.3.6.2.2 - The effects of future changes in solar forcing

Some of the future CMIP5 climate simulations using the RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} include an 11-year variation in total solar irradiance ({Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI}) but no underlying {Glossary.*Trend trend} beyond 2005. {Chapters.10 Chapter 10} noted that there has been little observed trend in TSI during a time period of rapid global warming since the late 1970s, but that the 11-year {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} does introduce a significant and measurable pattern of response in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_3 Section 10.3.1.1.3}). As discussed in {Chapters.8 Chapter 8} ({Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_3 Section 8.4.1.3}), the Sun has been in a ‘grand solar maximum’ of magnetic activity on the multi-decadal time scale. However, the most recent solar minimum was the lowest and longest since 1920, and some studies (e.g., {cite.11.'Lockwood_2010}) suggest there could be a continued decline towards a much quieter period in the coming decades, but there is low confidence in these {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_3 Section 8.4.1.3}). Nevertheless, if there is such a reduction in {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity}, there is high confidence that the variations in TSI RF will be much smaller than the projected increased {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} due to {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} ({Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_3 Section 8.4.1.3}). In addition, studies that have investigated the effect of a possible decline in TSI on future climate have shown that the associated decrease in global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} is much smaller than the warming expected from increases in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} GHGs ({cite.11.'Feulner_and_Rahmstorf_2010}; {cite.11.'Jones_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2013b}) However, regional impacts could be more significant ({cite.11.'Xoplaki_et_al_2001}; {cite.11.'Mann_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Gray_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Ineson_et_al_2011}).

As discussed in {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1 Section 8.4.1}, a recent satellite measurement ({cite.11.'Harder_et_al_2009}) found much greater than expected reduction at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths in the recent declining solar cycle phase. Changes in solar UV drive stratospheric O3 chemistry and can change RF. {cite.11.'Haigh_et_al_2010 Haigh et al. (2010)} show that if these observations are correct, they imply the opposite relationship between solar RF and solar activity over that period than has hitherto been assumed. These new measurements therefore increase {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in estimates of the sign of solar RF, but they are not expected to alter estimates of the maximum absolute magnitude of the solar contribution to RF, which remains small ({Chapters.8 Chapter 8}). However, they do suggest the possibility of a much larger impact of solar variations on the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} than previously thought, and some studies have suggested that this may lead to significant regional impacts on climate (as discussed in {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_3 Section 10.3.1.1.3}) that are not necessarily reflected by the RF {Glossary.*Metric metric} (see {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1 Section 8.4.1}).

In summary, possible future changes in solar irradiance could influence the rate at which global mean surface air temperature increases, but there is high confidence that this influence will be small in comparison to the influence of increasing concentrations of GHGs in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Understanding of the impacts of changes in solar irradiance on continental and sub-continental scale climate remains low.
