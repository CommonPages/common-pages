title: 11.3.6.2.1 - The effects of future volcanic eruptions

As discussed in Chapters {Chapters.8} and {Chapters.10}, explosive volcanic eruptions are the major cause of natural variations in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} on interannual to decadal time scales. Most important are large tropical and subtropical eruptions that inject substantial amounts of SO2 directly into the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}. The subsequent formation of sulphate aerosols leads to a negative RF of several watts per metre squared, with a typical {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of a year ({cite.11.'Robock_2000}). The eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991 was one of the largest in recent times, with a {Glossary.*Return_period return period} of about three times per century, but dwarfed by Tambora in 1815 ({cite.11.'Gao_et_al_2008}). Mt Pinatubo caused a rapid drop in a global mean surface air temperature of several tenths of a degree Celsius over the following year, but this signal disappeared over the next five years ({cite.11.'Hansen_et_al_1992}; {cite.11.'Soden_et_al_2002}; {cite.11.'Bender_et_al_2010}). In addition to global mean cooling, there are effects on the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} (e.g., {cite.11.'Trenberth_and_Dai_2007}), {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and ocean circulation (e.g., {cite.11.'Stenchikov_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Ottera_et_al_2010}). The surface {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} typically persists for a few years, but the subsurface ocean response can persist for decades or centuries, with consequences for {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise ({cite.11.'Delworth_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Stenchikov_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Gregory_2010}; {cite.11.'Timmreck_2012}).

Although it is possible to detect when various existing volcanoes become more active, or are more likely to erupt, the precise timing of an eruption, the amount of SO2 emitted and its distribution in the stratosphere are not predictable until after the eruption. Eruptions comparable to Mt Pinatubo can be expected to cause a short-term cooling of the climate with related effects on surface climate that persist for a few years before a return to warming trajectories discussed in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2 Section 11.3.2}. Larger eruptions, or several eruptions occurring close together in time, would lead to larger and/or more persistent effects.
