title: 11.3.6.1 - Uncertainties in Future Anthropogenic Forcing and the Consequences for Near-term Climate

Climate {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} for periods prior to year 2050 are not very sensitive to available alternative {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} for {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_1.11_3_2_1_1 Section 11.3.2.1.1}; {cite.11.'Stott_and_Kettleborough_2002}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}). Near-term projections, however, may be sensitive to changes in emissions of climate forcing agents with lifetimes shorter than CO2, particularly the {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} ({Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of a decade), tropospheric O3 (lifetime of weeks), and tropospheric aerosols (lifetime of days). Although the {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} and {Glossary.*SRES_scenarios SRES scenarios} span a similar range of total effective {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF}, see {Chapters.7.7_5 Section 7.5}, {'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}, {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}), they include different ranges of ERF from {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}, CH4, and tropospheric O3 (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_1 Section 11.3.5.1}, Tables AII.6.2 and AII.6.7 to AII.6.10). From years 2000 to 2030 the change in ERF across the RCPs ranges from –0.05 to +0.14 W m–2 for CH4 and from –0.04 to +0.08 W m–2 for tropospheric O3 (Tables AII.6.2 and AII.6.7; {cite.11.'Stevenson_et_al_2013}). From years 2000 to 2030 the total aerosol ERF becomes less negative, increasing by +0.26 W m–2 for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} (only RCP evaluated; for ACCMIP results see Table AII.6.9; {cite.11.'Shindell_et_al_2013}). Total ERF change across scenarios derived from the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} can be compared only beginning in 2010. For the period 2010 to 2030, total ERF in the CMIP5 decadal averages increases by +0.5 to +1.0 W m–2 ({Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} and RCP6.0 to RCP8.5; Table AII.6.10) while total ERF from the published RCPs increases by +0.7 to +1.1 W m–2 (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 to RCP8.5, Table AII.6.8). Here we re-examine the near-term temperature increases projected from the RCPs (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_1.11_3_2_1_1 Section 11.3.2.1.1}) and assess the potential for changes in near-term anthropogenic forcing to induce climate responses that fall outside these scenarios.

For the different RCP pathways the increase in global mean {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} by 2026–2035 relative to the reference period 1986-2005 ranges from 0.74°C (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0) to 0.94°C (RCP8.5) (median of CMIP5 models, see Figure 11.24, Table AII.7.5). This inter-scenario range of 0.20°C is smaller than the inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} for an individual scenario: 0.33°C to 0.52°C (defined as the 17 to 83% range of the decadal means of the models). This RCP inter-scenario spread may be too narrow as discussed in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5.11_3_5_1 Section 11.3.5.1}. The temperature increase of the most rapidly warming scenario (RCP8.5) emerges from inter-model spread (i.e., becomes greater than two times the 17 to 83% range) by about 2040, due primarily to increasing CH4 and CO2. By 2050 the inter-scenario spread is 0.8oC whereas the model spread for each scenario is only 0.6oC. At 2040 the ERF in the published RCPs ranges from 2.6 (RCP2.6) to 3.6 (RCP8.5) W m–2, and about 40% of this difference is due to the steady increases in CH4 and tropospheric O3 found only in RCP8.5. RCP6.0 has the lowest ERF and thus warms less rapidly than other RCPs up to 2030 (Table AII.6.8).

In terms of geographic patterns of warming, differences between RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 are within ±0.5°C over most of the globe for both summer and winter seasons for 2016–2035 (Figure 11.24b), but by 2036–2055 RCP8.5 is projected to be warmer than RCP2.6 by 0.5°C to 1.0°C over most continents, and by more than 1.0°C over the Arctic in winter. Although studies suggest that the Arctic response is complex and particularly sensitive to {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} aerosols ({cite.11.'Flanner_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Quinn_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Jacobson_2010}; {cite.11.'Ramana_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Bond_et_al_2013}; {cite.11.'Sand_et_al_2013}), the difference in ERF between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 is dominated by the GHGs, as the BC {Glossary.*Burden atmospheric burden} is decreasing through the century with little difference across the RCPs (Table AII.5.7).

Large changes in emissions of the well-mixed greenhouse gases ({Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}) produce only modest changes in the near term because these gases are long lived: For example, a 50% cut in Kyoto-gas emissions beginning in 1990 offsets the warming that otherwise would have occurred by only –0.11°C ± 0.03°C after 12 years ({cite.11.'Prather_et_al_2009}). In contrast, many studies have noted the large potential for air pollutant emission reductions to influence near-term climate because RF from these species responds almost immediately to changes in emissions. Decreases in sulphate aerosol have occurred through {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} of both air pollution and fossil-fuel emissions, and are expected to produce a near-term rise in {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} (e.g., {cite.11.'Jacobson_and_Streets_2009}; {cite.11.'Raes_and_Seinfeld_2009}; {cite.11.'Wigley_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Kloster_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Makkonen_et_al_2012}).

Because global mean aerosol forcing decreases in all RCP scenarios (AII.5.3 to AII.5.7, AII.6.9; see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5 Section 11.3.5}), the potential exists for a systematic difference between the CMIP3 models forced with the SRES scenarios and the CMIP5 models forced with the RCP scenarios. One study directly addressed the impacts of aerosols on climate under the RCP4.5 scenario, and found that the aerosol emission reductions induce about a 0.2°C warming in the near term compared with fixed 2005 aerosol levels (more indicative of the SRES CMIP3 aerosols) ({cite.11.'Levy_et_al_2013}). The cooling over the period 1951–2010 that is {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to non-{Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG} anthropogenic forcing in the CMIP5 models (Figures {'Figure_10_4 10.4} and {'Figure_10_5 10.5}) has a likely range of –0.25°C ± 0.35°C compared to +0.9°C ± 0.4°C for WMGHG. The non-WMGHG forcing generally includes the influence of non-aerosol warming agents over the historical period such as tropospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}, and a simple correction would give an aerosol-only cooling that is about 50% larger in magnitude (see ERF components, {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}). The near-term reductions in total aerosol emissions, however, even under the MFR scenario, are at most about 50% (AII.2.17 to AII.2.22), indicating a maximum near-term temperature response of about half that induced by the addition of aerosols over the last century. Hence, the evidence indicates that differences in aerosol loading from the SRES (conservatively assuming roughly constant aerosols) to the RCP scenarios can increase warming in the CMIP5 models relative to the CMIP3 models by up to 0.2°C in the near term for the same WMGHG forcing (medium confidence).

Many studies show that air pollutants influence climate and identify approaches to mitigate both air pollution and global warming by decreasing CH4, tropospheric O3 and absorbing aerosols, particularly BC (e.g., {cite.11.'Hansen_et_al_2000}; {cite.11.'Fiore_et_al_2002}, 2008, 2009; {cite.11.'Dentener_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'West_et_al_2006}; Royal Society, 2008; {cite.11.'Jacobson_2010}; {cite.11.'Penner_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'UNEP_and_WMO_2011}; {cite.11.'Anenberg_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Shindell_et_al_2012b}; {cite.11.'Unger_2012}; {cite.11.'Bond_et_al_2013}). An alternative set of technologically based scenarios ({cite.11.'UNEP_and_WMO_2011}) that examined controls on CH4 and BC emissions designed to reduce tropospheric CH4, O3 and BC also included reductions of co-emitted species (e.g., CO, OC, NOx). These reductions were applied in two CMIP5 models, and then those model responses were combined with the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} best estimates for the range of {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} and for {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} estimates for each component of RF ({cite.11.'Shindell_et_al_2012a}). This approach provided a near-term best estimate and range of global mean temperature change for the reference (UNEP-ref) and CH4-mitigation (UNEP-CH4) scenarios (Figure 11.24a, adjusted to reflect the 1986–2005 reference period). Under UNEP-CH4, anthropogenic CH4 emissions decrease by 24% from 2010 to 2030, and global warming is reduced by 0.16°C (best estimate) at 2030 and by 0.28°C at 2050. A third UNEP scenario (UNEP-BC+CH4; not shown) adds reductions in BC by 78% onto CH4 mitigation and reduces warming by an additional 0.12°C (best estimate) at 2030. However, it greatly increases the uncertainty owing to poor understanding of associated cloud adjustments (i.e., semi-direct and indirect effects) as well as of the ratio of BC to co-emitted reflective OC aerosols, their size distributions and mixing states (see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}, {Chapters.7.7_5 Section 7.5}). Corresponding BC reductions in the RCPs are only 4 to 11%.

Beyond global mean temperature, shifting magnitudes and geographic patterns of emissions may induce aerosol-specific changes in regional atmospheric circulation and precipitation. See {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}, especially Sections {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_2 7.6.2} and {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_4 7.6.4}, for assessment of this work ({cite.11.'Roeckner_et_al_2006}; Menon and et al., 2008; {cite.11.'Ming_et_al_2010}, 2011; {cite.11.'Ott_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Randles_and_Ramaswamy_2010}; {cite.11.'Allen_and_Sherwood_2011}; {cite.11.'Bollasina_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Leibensperger_et_al_2011b};{cite.11.'Fyfe_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Ganguly_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Rotstayn_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Shindell_et_al_2012b}; {cite.11.'Teng_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Bond_et_al_2013}). Recent trends in aerosol–fog interactions and snowpack decline are implicated in more rapid regional warming in Europe (van Oldenborgh et al., 2010; {cite.11.'Ceppi_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Scherrer_et_al_2012}), and coupling of aerosols and {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} could increase near-term local warming in the eastern USA ({cite.11.'Mickley_et_al_2011}). Major changes in the tropical circulation and rainfall have been attributed to increasing aerosols, but studies often disagree in sign (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4.11_3_2_4_3 Section 11.3.2.4.3}, Chapters {Chapters.10} and {Chapters.14}). The lack of standardization (e.g., different regions, different mixtures of reflecting and absorbing aerosols) and agreement across studies prevents generalization of these findings to project aerosol-induced changes in regional atmospheric circulation or precipitation in the near term.

Land use and land cover change (LULCC; see {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}), including {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation}, {Glossary.*Forest forest} degradation and agricultural expansion for bioenergy ({cite.11.'Georgescu_et_al_2009}; Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2012), can alter global climate forcing through changing surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} (assessed as ERF; {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}), the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle}, GHGs (for CO2, see Chapters {Chapters.6} and {Chapters.12}), or aerosols. The shift from forest to grassland in many places since the pre-industrial era has been formally attributed as a cause of regionally lower mean and extreme temperatures ({cite.11.'Christidis_et_al_2013}). RCP CO2 and CH4 anthropogenic emissions include land use changes ({cite.11.'Hurtt_et_al_2011}) that vary with the underlying storylines and differ across RCPs. These global-scale changes in crop and pasture land projected over the near term (+2% for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5; –4% for RCP4.5and RCP6.0) are smaller in magnitude than the 1950–2000 change (+6%) (see {'Figure_6_23 Figure 6.23}). Overall LULCC has had small impact on ERF (–0.15 W m–2; see AII.1.2) and thus as projected is not a major factor in near-term climate change on global scales.

Land use changes can also lead to sustained near-term changes in {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} through modification of the biogeophysical properties that alter the water and energy cycles. Localand regional-scale climate responses to LULCC can exceed those associated with global mean warming (Baidya Roy and Avissar, 2002; {cite.11.'Findell_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Pitman_et_al_2009}, 2012; {cite.11.'Pielke_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Boisier_et_al_2012}; de Noblet-Ducoudre et al., 2012; {cite.11.'Lee_and_Berbery_2012}). Examples of LULCC-driven changes include: Brazilian conversion to sugarcane induces seasonal shifts of 1 to 2°C ({cite.11.'Georgescu_et_al_2013}); European forested areas experience less severe heat waves ({cite.11.'Teuling_et_al_2010}); and deforested regions over the Amazon lack deep convective clouds (Wang et al., 2009). Systematic assessment of near-term, local-to-regional climate change is beyond the scope here.

In summary, climate projections for the near term are not very sensitive to the range in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other WMGHGs. By the 2040s the CMIP5 median for global mean temperature ranges from a low of +0.9°C (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0) to a high of +1.3°C (RCP8.5) above the CMIP5 reference period (Figure 11.24a; Table AII.7.5). See discussion below regarding possible offsets between the observed and CMIP5 reference periods. Alternative CH4 scenarios incorporating large emission reductions outside the RCP range would offset near-term warming by –0.2°C (medium confidence). Aerosols remain a major {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in near-term projections, on both global and regional scales. Removal of half of the sulphate aerosol, as projected before 2030 in the MFR scenario and by 2050 in most RCPs, would increase warming by up to +0.2°C (medium confidence). Actions to reduce BC aerosol could reduce warming, but the magnitude is highly uncertain, depending on co-emitted (reflective) aerosols and aerosol-cloud interactions ({Chapters.7 Chapter 7}; {Chapters.7.7_5 Section 7.5}). In addition, near-term climate change, including extremes and precipitation, may be driven locally by {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} and shifting geographic patterns of aerosols; and these regional climatic effects may exceed those induced by the global ERF.
