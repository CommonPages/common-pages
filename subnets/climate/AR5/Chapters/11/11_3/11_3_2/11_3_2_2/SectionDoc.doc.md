title: 11.3.2.2 - Free Atmospheric Temperature

Changes in zonal mean temperature for the near-term period (2016– 2035 compared to the base period 1986–2005) for the multi-model CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} show a pattern similar to that in the CMIP3, with warming in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and cooling in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} of a couple of degrees that is significant even in the near term period. There is relatively greater warming in the tropical upper troposphere and northern high latitudes. A more detailed assessment of observed and simulated changes in free atmospheric temperatures can be found in Sections {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_2.10_3_1_2_1 10.3.1.2.1} and {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_2 12.4.3.2}.
