title: 11.3.2.3.1 - Changes in precipitation

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the spatial patterns of precipitation change in response to GHG {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({Chapters.10 Chapter 10}, {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2 Section 10.3.2}) showed consistency between models on the largest scales (i.e., zonal means) but large uncertainty on smaller scales. The consistent pattern was characterized by increases at high latitudes and in wet regions (including the maxima in mean precipitation found in the tropics), and decreases in dry regions (including large parts of the subtropics). Large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the sign of projected change were seen especially in regions located on the borders between regions of increases and regions of decreases. More recent research has highlighted the fact that if models agree that the projected change is small in some sense relative to {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}, then agreement on the sign of the change is not expected ({cite.11.'Tebaldi_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Power_et_al_2012}). This recognition led to the identification of subregions within the border regions, where models agree that projected changes are either zero or small ({cite.11.'Power_et_al_2012}). This, and other considerations, also led to the realization that the consensus among models on precipitation projections is more widespread than might have been inferred on the basis of the projections described in the AR4 ({cite.11.'Power_et_al_2012}). Information on the reliability of nearterm projections can also be obtained from verification of past regional trends (Räisänen (2007); {Box_11_2 Box 11.2})

Since the AR4 there has also been considerable progress in understanding the factors that govern the spatial pattern of change in precipitation (P), precipitation minus evaporation (P – E), and inter-model differences in these patterns. The general pattern of wet-get-wetter (also referred to as ‘rich-get-richer’, e.g., {cite.11.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.11.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Allan_et_al_2010}) and dry-get-drier has been confirmed, although with deviations in some dry regions at present that are projected to become wetter by some models, e.g., Northeast Brazil in austral summer and East Africa (see Annex I). It has been demonstrated that the wet-get-wetter pattern implies an enhanced seasonal precipitation range between wet and dry seasons in the tropics, and enhanced inter-hemispheric precipitation gradients ({cite.11.'Chou_et_al_2007}).

It has recently been proposed that analysis of the {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget}, previously applied only to the global mean, may provide further insights into the controls on regional changes in precipitation ({cite.11.'Levermann_et_al_2009}; Muller and O’Gorman, 2011; O’Gorman et al., 2012). Muller and O’Gorman (2011) argue in particular that changes in radiative and surface sensible heat fluxes provide a guide to the local precipitation response over land. Projected and observed patterns of oceanic precipitation change in the tropics tend to follow patterns of {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} change because of local changes in atmospheric stability, such that regions warming more than the tropics as a whole tend to exhibit an increase in local precipitation, while regions warming less tend to exhibit reduced precipitation ({cite.11.'Johnson_and_Xie_2010}; {cite.11.'Xie_et_al_2010}).

AR4 ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2 Section 10.3.2} and {Chapters.11 Chapter 11}) showed that, especially in the near term, and on regional or smaller scales, the magnitude of projected changes in mean precipitation was small compared to the magnitude of natural internal variability ({cite.11.'Christensen_et_al_2007}). Recent work has confirmed this result, and provided more quantification (e.g., {cite.11.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2011}; {cite.11.'Hoerling_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Rowell_2011}; {cite.11.'Deser_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Power_et_al_2012}). {cite.11.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2011 Hawkins and Sutton (2011)} presented further analysis of CMIP3 results and found that, on spatial scales of the order of 1000 km, internal variability contributes 50 to 90% of the total uncertainty in all regions for projections of decadal and seasonal mean precipitation change for the next decade, and is the most important {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty for many regions for lead times up to three decades ahead ({'Figure_11_8 Figure 11.8}). Thereafter, response uncertainty is generally dominant. Forcing uncertainty (except for that relating to aerosols, see Section 11.4.7) is generally negligible for nearterm projections. The S/N ratio for projected changes in seasonal mean precipitation is highest in the subtropics and at high latitudes. {cite.11.'Rowell_2011 Rowell (2011)} found that the contribution of response uncertainty to the total uncertainty (response plus internal variability) in local precipitation change is highest in the deep tropics, particularly over South America, Africa, the east and central Pacific, and the Atlantic. Over tropical land and summer mid-latitude continents the representation of SST changes, atmospheric processes, land surface processes, and the terrestrial {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} all contribute to the uncertainty in projected changes in rainfall.

In addition to the response to GHG forcing, forcing from natural and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} aerosols may exert significant impacts on regional patterns of precipitation change as well as on {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature} ({cite.11.'Bollasina_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Yue_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Fyfe_et_al_2012}). Precipitation changes may arise as a consequence of temperature and stratification changes driven by {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}-induced radiative effects, and/or as indirect aerosol effects on cloud microphysics ({Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). Future {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of aerosols and aerosol {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} are subject to large uncertainty, and further large uncertainties arise in assessing the responses to these emissions. These issues are discussed in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6 Section 11.3.6}.

Figures {'Figure_11_12 11.12} and {'Figure_11_13 11.13}a present projections of near-term changes in precipitation from CMIP5. Regional maps and time series are presented in Annex I. The basic pattern of wet regions tending to get wetter and dry regions tending to get dryer is apparent, although with some regional deviations as mentioned previously. However, the large response uncertainty is evident in the substantial spread in the magnitude of projected change simulated by different {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({'Figure_11_13 Figure 11.13}a). In addition, it is important to recognize—as discussed in previous sections—that models may agree and still be in error (e.g., Power et al. 2012). In particular, there is some evidence from comparing observations with simulations of the recent past that climate models might be underestimating the magnitude of changes in precipitation in many regions ({cite.11.'Pincus_et_al_2008}; Liepert and Previdi, 2009; {cite.11.'Schaller_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Joetzjer_et_al_2012}) This evidence is discussed in detail in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9} ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}) and {Box_11_2 Box 11.2}, and could imply that projected changes in precipitation are underestimated by current models. However, the magnitude of any underestimation has yet to be quantified, and is subject to considerable uncertainty.

Figures {'Figure_11_12 11.12} and {'Figure_11_13 11.13}a also highlight the large amplitude of the natural internal variability of mean precipitation. On regional scales, mean projected changes are almost everywhere smaller than the estimated standard deviation of natural internal variability. The only exceptions are the northern high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean ({'Figure_11_12 Figure 11.12}). For zonal means ({'Figure_11_13 Figure 11.13}a) and at high latitudes only, the projected changes relative to the recent past exceed the estimated standard deviation of internal variability.

Overall, zonal mean precipitation will very likely increase in high and some of the mid latitudes, and will more likely than not decrease in the subtropics. At more regional scales precipitation changes may be influenced by anthropogenic aerosol emissions and will be strongly influenced by natural internal variability.
