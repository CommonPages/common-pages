title: 11.3.2.4.2 - Southern Hemisphere extratropical circulation

Increases in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, and related dynamical processes, are projected to lead to poleward shifts in the annual mean position of Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} and winds ({'Figure_11_17 Figure 11.17}; Chapters {Chapters.10} and {Chapters.12}). A key issue in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of near-term SH extratropical circulation change is the extent to which changes driven by stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} recovery will counteract changes driven by increasing GHGs. Several observational and modeling studies ({cite.11.'Gillett_and_Thompson_2003}; {cite.11.'Shindell_and_Schmidt_2004}; {cite.11.'Arblaster_and_Meehl_2006}; {cite.11.'Roscoe_and_Haigh_2007}; {cite.11.'Fogt_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Polvani_et_al_2011a}; {cite.11.'Gillett_et_al_2013}) indicate that, over the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the observed summertime poleward shift of the westerly jet (a positive Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM})) has been caused primarily by the depletion of stratospheric ozone, with increasing GHGs contributing only a smaller fraction to the observed trends. The latest generation of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} project substantially smaller poleward trends in SH atmospheric circulation in austral summer over the coming half century compared to those over the late 20th century, as the recovery of stratospheric ozone will oppose the effects of continually increasing GHGs ({cite.11.'Arblaster_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'McLandress_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Polvani_et_al_2011a}; Eyring et al., 2013). Locally, {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} may be a dominant contributor to near-term changes in lower-tropospheric zonal winds ({'Figure_11_17 Figure 11.17}). The average 2016–2035 SH extratropical storm tracks and zonal winds are likely to shift poleward relative to 1986–2005. However, even though a full recovery of the {Glossary.*Ozone_hole ozone hole} is not expected until the 2060s to 2070s ({'Table_5_4 Table 5.4}; WMO, 2010; see {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}), it is likely that over the near term there will be a reduced rate in the austral summertime poleward shift of the SH circumpolar trough, SH extratropical storm tracks and winds compared to its movement over the past 30 years, including the possibility of no detectable shift.
