title: 11.3.2.4.1 - Northern Hemisphere extratropical circulation

In the NH extratropics, some {Topics.*Climate_System Atmosphere}â€“Ocean General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}) indicate changes to atmospheric circulation from {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing by the mid-21st century, including a poleward shift of the jet streams and associated zonal mean {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} ({cite.11.'Miller_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Pinto_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Paeth_and_Pollinger_2010}) and a strengthening of the Atlantic storm track ({cite.11.'Pinto_et_al_2007}), {'Figure_11_15 Figure 11.15}. Consistent with this, the CMIP5 AOGCMs exhibit an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}) and Northern Annular Model ({Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM}) indices by 2050, especially in autumn and winter ({cite.11.'Gillett_et_al_2013}).

However, there are reasons to be cautious over these near-term {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. Although models simulate the broad features of the large-scale circulation well, there remain quite significant biases in many models (see Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_4.9_4_1_4_3 9.4.1.4.3} and {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_2 9.5.3.2}). The response of the NH circulation can be sensitive to small changes in model formulation ({cite.11.'Sigmond_et_al_2007}), and to features that are known to be poorly simulated in many {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. These features include highand low-latitude physics ({cite.11.'Rind_2008}; {cite.11.'Woollings_2010}), ocean circulation ({cite.11.'Woollings_and_Blackburn_2012}), tropical circulation ({cite.11.'Haarsma_and_Selten_2012}) and stratospheric dynamics ({cite.11.'Huebener_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Morgenstern_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Scaife_et_al_2012}). As a result, there is considerable model {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the response of the NH storm track position ({cite.11.'Ulbrich_et_al_2008}), stationary waves ({cite.11.'Brandefelt_and_Kornich_2008}) and the jet streams ({cite.11.'Miller_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Ihara_and_Kushnir_2009}; {cite.11.'Woollings_and_Blackburn_2012}). Further, CMIP5 models show that the response of NH extratropical circulation to even strong GHG forcing remains weak compared to recent multidecadal variability and a recent {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} study suggests that tropospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} changes may have been a key driver to NH extratropical circulation changes ({cite.11.'Gillett_et_al_2013}). Some AOGCMs simulate multi-decadal NAO variability as large as that recently observed with no {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} ({cite.11.'Selten_et_al_2004}; {cite.11.'Semenov_et_al_2008}). This suggests that {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} could dominate the anthropogenically forced response in the near term ({cite.11.'Deser_et_al_2012}).

Some studies have predicted a shift to the negative phase of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}) over the coming few decades, with potential impacts on atmospheric circulation around the Atlantic sector ({cite.11.'Knight_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Sutton_and_Hodson_2005}; {cite.11.'Folland_et_al_2009}). It has also been suggested that there may be significant changes in solar forcing over the next few decades, which could have an influence on NAO-related atmospheric circulation ({cite.11.'Lockwood_et_al_2011}), although these {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} are highly uncertain (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_2.11_3_6_2_2 Section 11.3.6.2.2}).

There is only medium confidence in near-term projections of a northward shift of NH storm track and westerlies, and an increase of the NAO/NAM because of the large response uncertainty and the potentially large influence of internal variability.
