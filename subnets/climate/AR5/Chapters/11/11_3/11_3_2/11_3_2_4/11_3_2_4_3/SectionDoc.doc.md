Increases in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} are expected to lead to a poleward shift of the {Glossary.*Hadley_Circulation Hadley Circulation} ({cite.11.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}, {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}). Relative to the late 20th century, the tendency towards a poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation will start to emerge by the mid-2030s, with certain intra-model consensus in the SH expansion, despite the counteracting effect of {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} recovery ({'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}). As with near-term changes in SH extratropical circulation, a key for near-term {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the structure of the SH Hadley Circulation is the extent to which future stratospheric ozone recovery will counteract the impact of GHGs. The poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation, particularly of the SH branch during austral summer, during the later decades of the 20th century has been largely {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the combined impact of stratospheric ozone depletion ({cite.11.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2002}; {cite.11.'Son_et_al_2008}, 2009a, 2009b; {cite.11.'Polvani_et_al_2011a}, 2011b; {cite.11.'Min_and_Son_2013}) and the concurrent increase in GHGs ({cite.11.'Arblaster_and_Meehl_2006}; {cite.11.'Arblaster_et_al_2011}) as discussed in the previous section. The poleward expansion of the Hadley Circulation driven by the response of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} to increasing GHGs ({cite.11.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Kang_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Staten_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Butler_et_al_2012}) would be counteracted in the SH by reduced stratospheric ozone depletion but depends on the rate of ozone recovery ({cite.11.'UNEP_and_WMO_2011}). Increases in the incoming {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} can lead to a widening of the Hadley Cell ({cite.11.'Haigh_1996}; {cite.11.'Haigh_et_al_2005}) and large volcanic eruption to contraction of the tropics and the tropical circulation ({cite.11.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Birner_2010}). So future solar variations and volcanic activities could also lead to variations in the width of the Hadley Cell. The poleward extent of the Hadley Circulation and associated dry zones can exhibit substantial {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} (e.g., {cite.11.'Birner_2010}; {cite.11.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2012}) that can be as large as its near-term projected changes ({'Figure_11_16 Figure 11.16}). There is also considerable uncertainty in the amplitude of the poleward shift of the Hadley Circulation in response to GHGs across multiple {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} ({cite.11.'Lu_et_al_2007}; {'Figure_11_16 Figure 11.16}). It is likely that the poleward extent of the Hadley Circulation will increase through the mid-21st century. However, because of the counteracting impacts of future changes in stratospheric ozone and GHG concentrations, it is unlikely that it will continue to expand poleward in the SH as rapidly as it did in recent decades.

The Hadley Cell expansion in the NH has been largely attributed to the low-frequency variability of the {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} ({cite.11.'Hu_et_al_2013}), the increase of black carbon ({Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}) and tropospheric ozone ({cite.11.'Allen_and_Sherwood_2011}). Internal variability in the poleward edge of the NH Hadley Circulation is large relative the radiatively forced signal ({'Figure_11_16 Figure 11.16}. Given the complexity in the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} mechanism of the NH expansion and the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in future concentrations of tropospheric pollutants, there is low confidence in the character of near-term changes to the structure of the NH Hadley Circulation.

Global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} and theoretical considerations suggest that a warming of the tropics should lead to a weakening of the zonally asymmetric or {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.11.'Knutson_and_Manabe_1995}; {cite.11.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.11.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.11.'Gastineau_et_al_2009}). {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} forcing can modify both Hadley and Walker Circulations, which—depending on the details of the aerosol forcing—may lead to temporary reversals or enhancements in any GHG-driven weakening of the Walker Circulation ({cite.11.'Sohn_and_Park_2010}; {cite.11.'Bollasina_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Merrifield_2011}; {cite.11.'DiNezio_et_al_2013}). Meanwhile, the strength and structure of the Walker Circulation are impacted by internal climate variations, such as the {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} (e.g., Battistiand Sarachik, 1995), the {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO} (e.g., Zhang et al. 1997) and the IPO ({cite.11.'Power_et_al_1999}, 2006; {cite.11.'Meehl_and_Hu_2006}; {cite.11.'Meehl_and_Arblaster_2011}; {cite.11.'Power_and_Kociuba_2011b}; {cite.11.'Meehl_and_Arblaster_2012}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2013a}). Even on time scales of 30 to 100 years, substantial variations in the strength of the Pacific Walker Circulation in the absence of changes in RF are possible ({cite.11.'Power_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Vecchi_et_al_2006}). Estimated near-term weakening of the Walker Circulation from CMIP3 models under the A1B scenario ({cite.11.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.11.'Power_and_Kociuba_2011a}) are very likely to be smaller than the impact of internal climate variations over 50-year time scales ({cite.11.'Vecchi_et_al_2006}). There is also considerable response uncertainty in the amplitude of the weakening of Walker Circulation in response to GHG increase across multiple AOGCMs ({cite.11.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.11.'DiNezio_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Power_and_Kociuba_2011a}, 2011b). Thus, there is low confidence in projected near-term changes to the Walker Circulation. It is very likely that there will be decades in which the Walker Circulation strengthens and weakens due to internal variability through the mid-century as the externally forced change is small compared to internally generated decadal variability.
