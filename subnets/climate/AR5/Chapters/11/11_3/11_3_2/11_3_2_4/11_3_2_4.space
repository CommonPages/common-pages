section 11_3_2_4

  |In the NH extratropics, some {Topics.*Climate_System Atmosphere}â€“Ocean General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}) indicate changes to atmospheric circulation from {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} by the mid-21st century. Increases in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, and related dynamical processes, are {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} to lead to poleward shifts in the annual mean position of Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} and winds. Increases in GHGs are also expected to lead to a poleward shift of the {Glossary.*Hadley_Circulation Hadley Circulation}. A warming of the tropics should lead to a weakening of the zonally asymmetric or {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation}.
