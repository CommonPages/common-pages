title: 11.3.2.5.1 - Temperature extremes

In the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2007b}), cold episodes were projected to decrease significantly in a future warmer climate and it was considered very likely that heat waves would be more intense, more frequent and last longer towards the end of the 21st century. These conclusions have generally been confirmed in subsequent studies addressing both global scales ({cite.11.'Clark_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Diffenbaugh_and_Scherer_2011}; {cite.11.'Caesar_and_Lowe_2012}; {cite.11.'Orlowsky_and_Seneviratne_2012}; {cite.11.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}) and regional scales (e.g., {cite.11.'Gutowski_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Alexander_and_Arblaster_2009}; {cite.11.'Fischer_and_Schar_2009}; {cite.11.'Marengo_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2009a}; {cite.11.'Diffenbaugh_and_Ashfaq_2010}; {cite.11.'Fischer_and_Schar_2010}; {cite.11.'Cattiaux_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Wang_et_al_2012}). In the SREX assessment it is concluded that increases in the number of warm days and nights and decreases in the number of {Topics.*Extreme_Events cold days and nights} are virtually certain on the global scale.

None of the aforementioned studies specifically addressed the near term. However, {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} (see also {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}) show that temperature extremes have already increased in many regions, consistent with climate change {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, and analyses of CMIP5 global projections show that this {Glossary.*Trend trend} will continue and become more notable. The CMIP5 model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} exhibits a significant decrease in the frequency of cold nights, an increase in the frequency of warm days and nights and an increase in the duration of warm spells ({cite.11.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). These changes are particularly evident in global mean projections (see {'Figure_11_17 Figure 11.17}). {'Figure_11_17 Figure 11.17} shows that for the next few decades—as discussed in the introduction to the current chapter—these changes are remarkably insensitive to the {Topics.*Emissions emission} scenario considered ({cite.11.'Caesar_and_Lowe_2012}). In most land regions and in the near-term, the frequency of warm days and warm nights will thus likely continue to increase, while that of cold days and cold nights will likely continue to decrease.

Near-term projections from General Circulation Model–Regional Climate Model ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM}–{Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCM}) model chains (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009) for Europe are shown in {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}, displaying near-term changes in mean and extreme temperature (left-hand panels) and precipitation (right-hand panels) relative to the reference period 1986– 2005. In terms of mean June, July and August (JJA) temperatures ({'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}a), projections show a warming of 0.6°C to 1.5°C, with highest changes over the land portion of the Mediterranean. The north–south gradient in the projections is consistent with the AR4. Daytime extreme summer temperatures in southern and central Europe are projected to warm substantially faster than mean temperatures (compare {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}a and b). This difference between changes in mean and extremes can be explained by increases in interannual and/or synoptic variability, or increases in {Glossary.*Diurnal_temperature_range diurnal temperature range} ({cite.11.'Gregory_and_Mitchell_1995}; {cite.11.'Schar_et_al_2004}; {cite.11.'Fischer_and_Schar_2010}; Hansen, 2012; {cite.11.'Quesada_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). There is some evidence, however, that this effect is overestimated in some of the models ({cite.11.'Fischer_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Stegehuis_et_al_2012}), leading to a potential overestimation of the projected Mediterranean summer mean warming ({cite.11.'Buser_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Boberg_and_Christensen_2012}). With regard to near-term projections of record heat compared to record cold (Meehletal.,2009b)show, for one model, that over the USA the ratio of daily record high temperatures to daily record low temperatures could increase from an early 2000s value of roughly 2 to 1 to a mid-century value of about 20 to 1.

In terms of December, January and February (DJF) temperatures ({'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}c), projections show a warming of 0.3°C to 1.8°C, with the largest changes in the N–NE part of Europe. This characteristic pattern of changes tends to persist to the end of century (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009). In contrast to JJA temperatures, daytime high-percentile (i.e., warm) winter temperatures are projected to warm slower than mean temperatures (compare {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}c and {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}d), while low-percentile (i.e., cold) winter temperatures warm faster than the mean. This behaviour is indicative of reductions in {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}, which may be linked to changes in storm track activity, reductions in diurnal temperature range and changes in snow cover (e.g., Colle et al. 2013; {cite.11.'Dutra_et_al_2011}).
