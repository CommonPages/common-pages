title: 11.3.2.5.3 - Tropical cyclones

The projected response of tropical cyclones (TCs) at the end of the 21st century is summarized in {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 Section 14.6.1} and the IPCC Special Report on Extremes (SREX) ({cite.11.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). Relative to the number of studies focussing on {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of TC activity at the end of the 21st century ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 Section 14.6.1}; {cite.11.'Knutson_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012} there are fewer studies that have explored near-term projections of TC activity ({'Table_11_2 Table 11.2}); the North Atlantic (NA) stands out as the basin with most studies. In the NA, there are mixed projections for basinwide TC frequency, suggesting significant decreases (Knutson et al., 2013a) or non-significant changes ({cite.11.'Villarini_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Villarini_and_Vecchi_2012}). Multi-model mean projected NA TC frequency changes based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 over the first half of the 21st century were smaller than the overall {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} estimated from the Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs), with internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} being a leading {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty through the mid-21st century ({cite.11.'Villarini_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Villarini_and_Vecchi_2012}). Therefore, based on the limited literature available, the conflicting near-term projections in basins with more than one study, the large influence of internal variability, the lack of confidently detected/{Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} changes in TC activity ({Chapters.10 Chapter 10}) and the conflicting projections for basin-wide TC frequency even at the end of the 21st century ({Chapters.14 Chapter 14}), there is currently low confidence in basin-scale and global projections of trends in tropical cyclone frequency to the mid-21st century.

Exploring different hurricane intensity measures, two studies project near-term increases of NA hurricane intensity (Knutson et al., 2013a; {cite.11.'Villarini_and_Vecchi_2013}), driven in large part by projected reductions in NA tropospheric aerosols in CMIP5 future {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. Studies project near-term increases in the frequency Category 4–5 TCs in the NA (Knutson et al., 2013a) and southwest Pacific ({cite.11.'Leslie_et_al_2007}). Published studies agree in the sign of projected mid-century intensity change (intensification), but the only basin with more than one study exploring intensity is the NA. For the NA, an estimate of the time scale of emergence of projected changes in intense TC frequency exceeds 60 years ({cite.11.'Bender_et_al_2010}), although that estimate depends crucially on the amplitude of internal climate variations of intense hurricane frequency (e.g., {cite.11.'Emanuel_2011}), which remains poorly constrained at the moment. Therefore, there is low confidence in near-term TC intensity projections in all TC basins.

Modes of climate variability that in the past have led to variations in the intensity, frequency and structure of tropical cyclones across the globe—such as the {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} (e.g., {cite.11.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2006}; {cite.11.'Wang_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Callaghan_and_Power_2011}; {Chapters.14 Chapter 14})—are very likely to continue influencing TC activity through the mid-21st century. Therefore, it is very likely that over the next few decades tropical cyclone frequency, intensity and spatial distribution globally, and in individual basins, will vary from year to year and decade to decade.
