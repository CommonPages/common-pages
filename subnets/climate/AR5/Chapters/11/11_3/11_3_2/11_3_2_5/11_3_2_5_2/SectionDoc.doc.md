title: 11.3.2.5.2 - Heavy precipitation events

For the 21st century, the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} and the SREX concluded that heavy precipitation events were likely to increase in many areas of the globe ({cite.11.'IPCC_2007}). Since AR4, a larger number of additional studies have been published using global and {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} models ({cite.11.'Fowler_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Gutowski_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Sun_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Im_et_al_2008}; O’Gorman and Schneider, 2009; {cite.11.'Xu_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Hanel_and_Buishand_2011}; {cite.11.'Heinrich_and_Gobiet_2011}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2012b}). For the near term, CMIP5 global {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({'Figure_11_17 Figure 11.17}c) confirm a clear tendency for increases in heavy precipitation events in the global mean, but there are significant variations across regions ({cite.11.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). Past observations have also shown that interannual and decadal variability in mean and heavy precipitation are large, and are in addition strongly affected by {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} (e.g., El Niño), volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} loads (see {Chapters.2.2_3.2_3_1 Section 2.3.1}). In general models have difficulties in representing these variations, particularly in the tropics (see {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_4.9_5_4_2 Section 9.5.4.2}). Thus the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events will likely increase over many land areas in the near term, but this {Glossary.*Trend trend} will not be apparent in all regions, because of natural variability and possible influences of anthropogenic aerosols.

Simulations with regional {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} demonstrate that the response in terms of heavy precipitation events to anthropogenic climate change may become evident in some but not all regions in the near term. For instance, ENSEMBLES projections for Europe (see {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}e–h) confirm the previous IPCC results that changes in mean precipitation as well as heavy precipitation events are characterized by a pronounced north–south gradient in the extratropics, especially in the winter season, with precipitation increases in the higher latitudes and decreases in the subtropics. Although this pattern starts to emerge in the near term, the projected changes are statistically significant only in a fraction of the domain. The results are affected by both changes in water vapour content as induced by large-scale warming and large-scale circulation changes. {'Figure_11_18 Figure 11.18}e–h also shows that midand high-latitude projections for changes in DJF extremes and means are qualitatively similar in the near term, at least for the event size considered.

Previous work reviewed in AR4 has established that extreme precipitation events may increase substantially stronger than mean precipitation amounts. More specifically, {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} may increase with the atmospheric water vapour content, that is, up to the rate of the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausius–Clapeyron} (CC) relationship (e.g., {cite.11.'Allen_and_Ingram_2002}). More recent work suggests that increases beyond this threshold may occur for short-term events associated with thunderstorms (Lenderink and Van Meijgaard, 2008; {cite.11.'Lenderink_and_Meijgaard_2010}) and tropical {Glossary.*Convection convection} (O’Gorman, 2012). A number of studies showed strong dependencies on location and season, but confirm the existence of significant deviations from the CC scaling (e.g., {cite.11.'Lenderink_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Mishra_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Berg_et_al_2013}). Studies with cloud-resolving models generally support the existence of temperature-precipitation relations that are close to or above (up to about twice) the CC relation ({cite.11.'Muller_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Singleton_and_Toumi_2012}).
