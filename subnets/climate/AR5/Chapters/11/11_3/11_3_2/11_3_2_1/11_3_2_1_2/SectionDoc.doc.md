title: 11.3.2.1.2 - Regional and seasonal patterns of surface warming

The geographical pattern of near-term surface warming simulated by the CMIP5 models ({'Figure_11_10 Figure 11.10}) is consistent with previous IPCC reports in a number of key aspects, although weaknesses in the ability of current models to capture observed regional trends ({Box_11_2 Box 11.2}) must be kept in mind. First, temperatures over land increase more rapidly than over sea (e.g., {cite.11.'Manabe_et_al_1991}; {cite.11.'Sutton_et_al_2007}). Processes that contribute to this land–sea warming contrast include different local feedbacks over ocean and land and changes in atmospheric energy transport from ocean to land regions (e.g., {cite.11.'Lambert_and_Chiang_2007}; {cite.11.'Vidale_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Shimpo_and_Kanamitsu_2009}; {cite.11.'Fasullo_2010}; {cite.11.'Boer_2011}; {cite.11.'Joshi_et_al_2011}).

Second, the projected warming in wintertime shows a pronounced polar amplification in the NH (see {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}). This feature is found in virtually all coupled model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, but the CMIP3 simulations generally appeared to underestimate this effect in comparison to observations ({cite.11.'Stroeve_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Screen_and_Simmonds_2010}). Several studies have isolated mechanisms behind this amplification, which include reductions in snow cover and retreat of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} (e.g., {cite.11.'Serreze_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Comiso_et_al_2008}); changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulations ({cite.11.'Chylek_et_al_2009}, 2010; {cite.11.'Simmonds_and_Keay_2009}); presence of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} soot in the Arctic environment ({cite.11.'Flanner_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Quinn_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Jacobson_2010}; {cite.11.'Ramana_et_al_2010}); and increases in cloud cover and water vapour (Francis, 2007; {cite.11.'Schweiger_et_al_2008}). Most studies argue that changes in sea ice are central to the polar amplification—see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_4.11_3_4_1 Section 11.3.4.1} for further discussion. Further information about the regional changes in surface air temperature projected by the CMIP5 models is presented in Annex I.

As discussed in Sections {Chapters.11.11_1 11.1} and {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_1 11.3.1}, the signal of climate change is emerging against a background of natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}. The concept of ‘emergence’ describes the magnitude of the climate change signal relative to this background variability, and may be useful for some climate impact assessments (e.g., {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, {Chapters.11 Chapter 11}, {'Table_11_1 Table 11.1}; {cite.11.'Mahlstein_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2012}; see also {FAQ_10_2 FAQ 10.2}). However, it is important to recognize that there is no single {Glossary.*Metric metric} of emergence. It depends on user-driven choices of variable, space and time scale, of the baseline relative to which changes are measured (e.g., pre-industrial versus recent climate) and of the threshold at which emergence is defined.

{'Figure_11_11 Figure 11.11} quantifies the ‘Time of Emergence’ (ToE) of the mean warming signal relative to the recent past (1986–2005), based on the CMIP5 RCP4.5 projections, using a spatial {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of 2.5° latitude × 2.5° longitude, the standard deviation of interannual variations as the measure of internal variability, and a signal-to-noise threshold of 1. Because of the dependence on user-driven choices, the most important information in {'Figure_11_11 Figure 11.11} is the geographical and seasonal variation in ToE, seen in the maps, and the variation in ToE between models, shown in the histograms. Consistent with {cite.11.'Mahlstein_et_al_2011 Mahlstein et al. (2011)}, the earliest ToE is found in the tropics, with ToE in mid-latitudes typically a decade or so later. Over North Africa and Asia, earlier ToE is found for the warm half-year (April to September) than for the cool half-year. Earlier ToE is generally found for larger space and time scales, because the variance of natural internal variability decreases with averaging ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_1.11_3_1_1 Section 11.3.1.1} and AR4, Section 10.5.4.3). This tendency can be seen in {'Figure_11_11 Figure 11.11} by comparing the median value of the histograms for area averages with the area average of the median ToE inferred from the maps (e.g., for {Topics.*Regional_Climate Region} 2). The large range of values for ToE implied by different CMIP5 models, which can be as much as 30 years, is a consequence of differences in both the magnitude of the warming signal simulated by the models (i.e., {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}, see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_1.11_3_1_1 Section 11.3.1.1}) and in the amplitude of simulated natural internal variability ({cite.11.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2012}).

In summary, it is very likely that anthropogenic warming of surface air temperature over the next few decades will proceed more rapidly over land areas than over oceans, and that the warming over the Arctic in winter will be greater than the global mean warming over the same period. Relative to background levels of natural internal variability, near-term increases in seasonal mean and annual mean temperatures are expected to occur more rapidly in the tropics and subtropics than in mid-latitudes (high confidence).
