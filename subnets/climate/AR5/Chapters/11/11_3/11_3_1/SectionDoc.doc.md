title: 11.3.1 - Introduction

In this section the outlook for global and {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} up to mid-century is assessed, based on {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. In contrast to the {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} discussed in {Chapters.11.11_2 Section 11.2}, these projections are not initialized using observations; instead, they are initialized from historical simulations of the evolution of climate from pre-industrial conditions up to the present. The historical simulations are forced by estimates of past {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural climate forcing agents, and the projections are obtained by forcing the models with scenarios for future climate forcing agents. Major use is made of the CMIP5 model experiments forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios discussed in Chapters {Chapters.1} and {Chapters.8}. Projections of climate change in this and subsequent chapters are expressed relative to the reference period: 1986–2005. In this chapter most emphasis is given to the period 2016–2035, but some information on changes projected before and after this period (up to mid-century) is also provided. Longer-term projections are assessed in Chapters {Chapters.12} and {Chapters.13}.

Key assessment questions addressed in this section are: What is the externally forced signal of near-term climate change, and how large is it compared to natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}? From the point of view of climate impacts, the absolute magnitude of climate change may in some instances be less important than the magnitude relative to the local level of natural internal variability. Because many systems are naturally adapted to a background level of variability, it may be changes that move outside of this range that are most likely to trigger impacts that are unprecedented in the recent past (e.g., {cite.11.'Lobell_and_Burke_2008 Lobell and Burke (2008)} for crops).

An important conclusion of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1 Section 10.3.1}) was that nearterm climate projections are not very sensitive to plausible alternative non-{Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} scenarios for GHG concentrations (specifically the Special Report on {Topics.*Emissions Emission} {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} (SRES) scenarios; comparison with RCP scenarios is discussed in {Chapters.1 Chapter 1}), that is, in the near term, different scenarios give rise to similar magnitudes and patterns of climate change. (Note, however, that some impacts may be more sensitive.) For this reason, most of the projections presented in this chapter are based on one specific RCP scenario, RCP4.5. RCP4.5 was chosen because of its intermediate GHG forcing. However, there is greater sensitivity to other forcing agents, in particular anthropogenic aerosols (e.g., {cite.11.'Chalmers_et_al_2012}). Consequently, a further question addressed in this section (especially in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_1 Section 11.3.6.1}) is: To what extent are near-term climate projections sensitive to alternative scenarios for {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing}? Note finally that a great deal of additional information on near-term projections is provided in Annex I.
