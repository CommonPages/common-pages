title: 11.3.3.1 - Temperature

Globally averaged surface and near-surface ocean temperatures are {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} by {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} to warm over the early 21st century, in response to both present day atmospheric concentrations of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} (‘committed warming’; e.g., {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2006}) and projected future changes in RF ({'Figure_11_19 Figure 11.19}). Globally averaged {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} shows substantial year-to-year and decade-to-decade variability (e.g., {cite.11.'Knutson_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2011}), whereas the variability of depth-averaged ocean temperatures is much less (e.g., {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2011}; {cite.11.'Palmer_et_al_2011}). The rate at which globally averaged surface and depth-averaged temperatures rise in response to a given scenario for RF shows a considerable spread between models (an example of response {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty}; see {Chapters.11.11_2 Section 11.2}), due to differences in {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} and ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} (e.g., {cite.11.'Gregory_and_Forster_2008}). In the CMIP5 models under all RCP {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, globally averaged SSTs are projected to be warmer over the near term relative to 1986–2005 ({'Figure_11_20 Figure 11.20}).

A key uncertainty in the future evolution of globally averaged oceanic temperature are possible future large volcanic eruptions, which could impact the radiative balance of the planet for 2 to 3 years after their eruption and act to reduce oceanic temperature for decades into the future ({cite.11.'Delworth_et_al_2005}; {cite.11.'Stenchikov_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Gregory_2010}). An estimate using the GFDL-CM2.1 coupled AOGCM ({cite.11.'Stenchikov_et_al_2009}) suggests that a single Tambora (1815)-like volcano could erase the projected global ocean depth-averaged temperature increase for many years to a decade. A Pinatubo (1991)-like volcano could erase the projected increase for 2 to 10 years. See {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6 Section 11.3.6} for further discussion.

In the absence of multiple major volcanic eruptions (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_6.11_3_6_2 Section 11.3.6.2}), it is very likely that globally averaged surface and depth-averaged temperatures averaged 2016–2035 will be warmer than those averaged over 1986–2005.

There are regional variations in the projected amplitude of ocean temperature change ({'Figure_11_20 Figure 11.20}) which are influenced by ocean circulation as well as surface heating ({cite.11.'Timmermann_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.11.'DiNezio_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Yin_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Xie_et_al_2010}; {cite.11.'Yin_et_al_2010}), including changes in tropospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} concentrations (e.g., {cite.11.'Booth_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Villarini_and_Vecchi_2012}). Inter-decadal variability of upper ocean temperatures is larger in mid-latitudes, particularly in the NH, than in the tropics. A consequence of this contrast is that it will take longer in the mid-latitudes than in the tropics for the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} warming signal to emerge from the noise of internal variability ({cite.11.'Wang_et_al_2010}).

Projected changes to thermal structure of the tropical Indo-Pacific are strongly dependent on the future behaviour of the {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.11.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.11.'DiNezio_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Timmermann_et_al_2010}), in addition to changes in heat transport and changes in surface heat fluxes. It is likely that internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} will be a dominant contributor to changes in the depth and tilt of the equatorial {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline}, and the strength of the east–west gradient of SST across the Pacific through the mid-21st century; thus it is likely there will be multi-year periods with increases or decreases in these measures.
