As discussed in previous assessment reports, the AMOC is generally projected to weaken over the next century in response to increase in atmospheric GHG. However, the rate and magnitude of weakening is very uncertain. Response {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} is a major contributor in the near term, but the influence of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} aerosols and natural RFs (solar, volcanic) cannot be neglected, and could be as important as the influence of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} (e.g., {cite.11.'Delworth_and_Dixon_2006}; {cite.11.'Stenchikov_et_al_2009}). For example, the rate of weakening of the AMOC in two models with different climate sensitivities is quite different, with the less sensitive model (CCSM4) showing less weakening and a more rapid recovery than the more sensitive model (Community {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Model 1/Community {Glossary.*Atmosphere Atmosphere} Model 5 (CESM1/CAM5; {cite.11.'Meehl_et_al_2013c}). In addition, the natural variability of the AMOC on decadal time scales is poorly known and poorly understood, and could dominate any anthropogenic response in the near term ({cite.11.'Drijfhout_and_Hazeleger_2007}). The AMOC is known to play an important role in the decadal variability of the North Atlantic Ocean, but {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} show large differences in their simulation of both the amplitude and spectrum of AMOC variability (e.g., {cite.11.'Bryan_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Msadek_et_al_2010}). In some {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} changes in SH surface winds influence the evolution of the AMOC on time scales of many decades ({cite.11.'Delworth_and_Zeng_2008}), so the delayed response to SH wind changes, driven by the historical reduction in stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} along with its projected recovery, could be an additional confounding issue ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_3 Section 11.3.2.3}). Overall, it is likely that there will be some decline in the AMOC by 2050, but decades during which the AMOC increases are also to be expected. There is low confidence in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of when an anthropogenic influence on the AMOC might be detected ({cite.11.'Baehr_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Roberts_and_Palmer_2012}).

Projected changes to oceanic circulation in the Indo-Pacific are strongly dependent on future response of the {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.11.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.11.'DiNezio_et_al_2009}), the near-term projected weakening of which is smaller than the expected variability on time scales of decades to years ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4.11_3_2_4_3 Section 11.3.2.4.3}). Taking variability into account, there is medium confidence in a weakening of equatorial Pacific circulation, including equatorial upwelling and the shallow subtropical overturning in the Pacific, and the Indonesian Throughflow over the coming decades.
