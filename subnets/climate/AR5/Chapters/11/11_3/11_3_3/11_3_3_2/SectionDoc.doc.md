title: 11.3.3.2 - Salinity

Changes in sea surface salinity are expected in response to changes in precipitation, evaporation and {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} (see {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_3 Section 11.3.2.3}), as well as ocean circulation; in general (but not in every {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}), salty regions are expected to become saltier and fresh regions fresher (e.g., Durack et al. 2012; Terray et al. 2012; {'Figure_11_20 Figure 11.20}). As discussed in {Chapters.10 Chapter 10} ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_2 Section 10.4.2}), observation-based and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} have found some evidence of an emerging {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} signal in salinity change ({Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_2 Section 10.4.2}), in particular increases in surface salinity in the subtropical North Atlantic, and decreases in the west Pacific warm pool region ({cite.11.'Stott_et_al_2008}; {cite.11.'Cravatte_et_al_2009}; {cite.11.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}; {cite.11.'Durack_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Pierce_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Terray_et_al_2012}). Models generally predict increases in salinity in the tropical and (especially) subtropical Atlantic, and decreases in the western tropical Pacific over the next few decades ({'Figure_11_20 Figure 11.20}) ({cite.11.'Durack_et_al_2012}; {cite.11.'Terray_et_al_2012}). These {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} decreases in the Atlantic and in the western tropical Pacific are considered likely.

Projected near-term increases in freshwater flux into the Arctic Ocean produce a fresher {Glossary.*Surface_layer surface layer} and increased transport of fresh water into the North Atlantic ({cite.11.'Holland_et_al_2006}; {cite.11.'Holland_et_al_2007}; {cite.11.'Vavrus_et_al_2012}). Such contributions to decreased density of the ocean surface layer in the North Atlantic could act to reduce deep ocean {Glossary.*Convection convection} there and contribute to a near-term reduction of strength of Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC). However, the strength of the AMOC can also be modulated by changes in temperature, such as those from changing {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} ({cite.11.'Delworth_and_Dixon_2006}).
