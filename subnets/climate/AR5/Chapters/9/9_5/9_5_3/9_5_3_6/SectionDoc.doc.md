title: 9.5.3.6 - Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}) refers to a {Topics.*Climate_Variability mode of variability} involving {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} anomalies over the North Pacific (north of 20°N) ({cite.9.'Mantua_et_al_1997}). Although the PDO time series exhibits considerable decadal variability, it is difficult to ascertain whether there are any robust spectral peaks given the relatively short observational record ({cite.9.'Minobe_1997}, 1999; {cite.9.'Pierce_2001}; {cite.9.'Deser_et_al_2004}). The ability of climate models to represent the PDO has been assessed by {cite.9.'Stoner_et_al_2009 Stoner et al. (2009)} and {cite.9.'Furtado_et_al_2011 Furtado et al. (2011)}. Their results indicate that approximately half of the CMIP3 models simulate the observed spatial pattern and temporal behaviour (e.g., enhanced variance at low frequencies); however, spectral peaks are consistently higher in frequency than those suggested by the short observational record. The modelled PDO correlation with SST anomalies in the tropical Indo-Pacific are strongly underestimated by the CMIP3 models ({cite.9.'Wang_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Deser_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Furtado_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Lienert_et_al_2011}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} have been shown to simulate features of the closely related Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO, based on SSTs over the entire Pacific basin; see {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_3 Section 14.7.3}; {cite.9.'Power_and_Colman_2006}; {cite.9.'Power_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Meehl_et_al_2009}), although deficiencies remain in the strength of the tropical– extratropical connections.
