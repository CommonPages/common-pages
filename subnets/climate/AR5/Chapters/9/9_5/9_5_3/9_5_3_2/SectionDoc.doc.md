title: 9.5.3.2 - Extratropical Circulation, North Atlantic Oscillation and Other Related Dipolar and Annular Modes

Based on CMIP3 models, {cite.9.'Gerber_et_al_2008 Gerber et al. (2008)} confirmed the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessment that climate models are able to capture the broad spatial and temporal features of the North Atlantic Oscillation ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}), but there are substantial differences in the spatial patterns amongst individual models ({cite.9.'Casado_and_Pastor_2012}; {cite.9.'Handorf_and_Dethloff_2012}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} tend to have patterns of variability that are more annular in character than observed ({cite.9.'Xin_et_al_2008}). Models substantially overestimate persistence on sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales, and have difficulty simulating the seasonal cycle of annular mode time scales found in reanalyses ({cite.9.'Gerber_et_al_2008}). The unrealistically long time scale of variability is worse in models with particularly strong equatorward biases in the mean jet location, a result which has been found to hold in the North Atlantic and in the SH ({cite.9.'Barnes_and_Hartmann_2010}; {cite.9.'Kidston_and_Gerber_2010}).

As described in the AR4, climate models have generally been unable to simulate changes as strong as the observed NAO {Glossary.*Trend trend} over the period 1965–1995, either in coupled mode ({cite.9.'Gillett_2005}; {cite.9.'Stephenson_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Stoner_et_al_2009}) or forced with observed boundary conditions ({cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2009 Scaife et al. (2009)}. However, there are a few exceptions to this (e.g., {cite.9.'Selten_et_al_2004}; {cite.9.'Semenov_et_al_2008}), so it is unclear to what extent the underestimation of late 20th century trends reflects model shortcomings versus {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}. Further evidence has emerged of the coupling of NAO variability between the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}, and even models with improved stratospheric {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} appear to underestimate the vertical coupling ({cite.9.'Morgenstern_et_al_2010}) with consequences for the NAO response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} ({cite.9.'Sigmond_and_Scinocca_2010}; {cite.9.'Karpechko_and_Manzini_2012}; {cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2012}).

The Pacific basin analogue of the NAO, the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is a prominent pattern of wintertime atmospheric circulation variability characterized by a north–south dipole in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure ({cite.9.'Linkin_and_Nigam_2008}). Although climate models simulate the main spatial features of the NPO, many of them are unable to capture the observed linkages with tropical variability and the ocean ({cite.9.'Furtado_et_al_2011}).

{cite.9.'Raphael_and_Holland_2006 Raphael and Holland (2006)} showed that coupled models produce a clear Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}) but that there are relatively large differences between models in terms of the exact shape and orientation of this pattern. {cite.9.'Karpechko_et_al_2009 Karpechko et al. (2009)} found that the CMIP3 models have problems representing linkages between the SAM and {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}, surface air temperature, precipitation and particularly {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} in the Antarctic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}.
