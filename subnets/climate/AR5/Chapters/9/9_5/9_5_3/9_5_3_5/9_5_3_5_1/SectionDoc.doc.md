title: 9.5.3.5.1 - Teleconnections affecting North America

The Pacific North American ({Glossary.*Pacific_North_American_pattern PNA}) pattern is a wavetrain-like pattern in mid-level geopotential heights. The majority of CMIP3 models simulate the spatial structure of the PNA pattern in wintertime ({cite.9.'Stoner_et_al_2009}). The PNA pattern has contributions from both internal atmospheric variability ({cite.9.'Johnson_and_Feldstein_2010}) and {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO} teleconnections ({cite.9.'Deser_et_al_2004}). The power spectrum of this temporal behaviour is generally captured by the CMIP3 models, although the level of year-to-year autocorrelation varies according to the strength of the simulated ENSO and PDO ({cite.9.'Stoner_et_al_2009}).
