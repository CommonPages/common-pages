title: 9.5.3.5.2 - Tropical ENSO teleconnections

These moist teleconnection pathways involve mechanisms related to those at play in the precipitation response to global warming ({cite.9.'Chiang_and_Sobel_2002}; {cite.9.'Neelin_et_al_2003}) and provide challenging test statistics for model precipitation response. Compared to earlier generation {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models tend to do somewhat better ({cite.9.'Neelin_2007}; {cite.9.'Cai_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Coelho_and_Goddard_2009}; {cite.9.'Langenbrunner_and_Neelin_2013}) at precipitation reductions associated with El Niño over equatorial South America and the Western Pacific, although CMIP5 offers little further improvement over CMIP3 (see for instance the standard deviation of precipitation in the western Pacific in {'Figure_9_36 Figure 9.36}). CMIP5 models simulate the sign of the precipitation change over broad regions, and do well at predicting the amplitude of the change (for a given {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}) ({cite.9.'Langenbrunner_and_Neelin_2013}).

A regression of the West African {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} precipitation index with global SSTs reveals two major teleconnections ({cite.9.'Fontaine_and_Janicot_1996}). The first highlights the strong influence of {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, while the second reveals a relationship between the SST in the Gulf of Guinea and the northward migration of the monsoon rain belt over West Africa. Most CMIP3 models show a single dominant Pacific teleconnection, which is, however, of the wrong sign for half of the models ({cite.9.'Joly_et_al_2007}). Only one model shows a significant second mode, emphasizing the difficulty in simulating the response of the African rain belt to Atlantic SST anomalies that are not synchronous with Pacific anomalies.

Both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models have been evaluated and found to vary in their abilities to represent both the seasonal cycle of correlations between the Niño 3.4 and North Australian SSTs ({cite.9.'Catto_et_al_2012a}, 2012b) with little change in quality from CMIP3 to CMIP5. Generally the models do not capture the strength of the negative correlations during the second half of the year. The models also still struggle to capture the SST evolution in the North Australian {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} during El Niño and {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña}. {Glossary.*Teleconnection Teleconnection} patterns from both ENSO and the {Glossary.*Indian_Ocean_Dipole Indian Ocean Dipole} to precipitation over Australia are reasonably well simulated in the key September-November season ({cite.9.'Cai_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Weller_and_Cai_2013b}) in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model mean.
