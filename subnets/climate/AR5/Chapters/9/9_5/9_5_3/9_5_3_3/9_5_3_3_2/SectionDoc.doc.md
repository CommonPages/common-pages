title: 9.5.3.3.2 - Atlantic multi-decadal variability/Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation

The Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), also known as Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}), is a mode of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} with an apparent period of about 70 years, and a pattern centred in the North Atlantic Ocean (see {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_6 Section 14.7.6}). In the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, it was shown that a number of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} produced AMO-like multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic linked to variability in the strength of the AMOC. Subsequent analyses has confirmed this, however simulated time scales range from 40 to 60 years ({cite.9.'Frankcombe_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Park_and_Latif_2010}; {cite.9.'Kavvada_et_al_2013}), to a century or more ({cite.9.'Msadek_and_Frankignoul_2009}; {cite.9.'Menary_et_al_2012}). In addition, the spatial patterns of variability related to the AMOC differ in many respects from one model to another as shown in {'Figure_9_34 Figure 9.34}.

The presence of AMO-like variability in unforced simulations, and the fact that forced 20th century simulations in the CMIP3 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} produce AMO variability that is not in phase with that observed, implies the AMO is not predominantly a result of the forcings imposed on the models ({cite.9.'Kravtsov_and_Spannagle_2008}; {cite.9.'Knight_2009}; {cite.9.'Ting_et_al_2009}). Results from the CMIP5 models also show a key role for internal variability, alongside a contribution from {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} in recent decades ({cite.9.'Terray_2012}). Historical AMO fluctuations have been better reproduced in a model with a more sophisticated {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} treatment than was typically used in CMIP3 ({cite.9.'Booth_et_al_2012a}), albeit at the expense of introducing other observational inconsistencies ({cite.9.'Zhang_et_al_2013}). This could suggest that at least part of the AMO may in fact be forced, and that aerosols play a role. In addition to tropospheric aerosols, OtteraÌŠ et al. (2010) showed the potential for simulated volcanic forcing to have influenced AMO fluctuations over the last 600 years.
