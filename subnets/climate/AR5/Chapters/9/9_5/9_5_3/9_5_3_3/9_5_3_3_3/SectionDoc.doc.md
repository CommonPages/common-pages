title: 9.5.3.3.3 - Tropical zonal and meridional modes

The Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) is the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical Atlantic, is characterized by an anomalous meridional shift in the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} ({cite.9.'Chiang_and_Vimont_2004}), and has impacts on hurricane tracks over the North Atlantic ({cite.9.'Xie_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Smirnov_and_Vimont_2011}). Virtually all CMIP models simulate AMMlike {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} variability in their 20th century climate simulations. However, most models underestimate the SST variance associated with the AMM, and position the north tropical Atlantic SST anomaly too far equatorward. More problematic is the fact that the development of the AMM in many models is led by a zonal mode during boreal winter—a feature that is not observed in nature ({cite.9.'Breugem_et_al_2006}). This spurious AMM behaviour in the models is expected to be associated with the severe model biases in simulating the ITCZ (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_5.9_4_2_5_2 Section 9.4.2.5.2}).

Atlantic Niño

CMIP3 models have considerable difficulty simulating Atlantic Niño in their 20th century climate simulations. For many models the socalled ‘Atl-3’ SST index (20°W to 0°W, 3°S to 3°N) displays the wrong seasonality, with the maximum value in either DJF or SON instead of JJA as is observed ({cite.9.'Breugem_et_al_2006}). Despite large biases in the simulated climatology ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_5.9_4_2_5_2 Section 9.4.2.5.2}), about one third of CMIP5 models capture some aspects of Atlantic Niño variability, including amplitude, spatial pattern and seasonality ({cite.9.'Richter_et_al_2013}). This represents an improvement over CMIP3.
