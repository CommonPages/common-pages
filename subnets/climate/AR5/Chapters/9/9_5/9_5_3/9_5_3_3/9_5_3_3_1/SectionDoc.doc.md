title: 9.5.3.3.1 - Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability

Previous comparisons of the observed and simulated AMOC were restricted to its mean strength, as it had only been sporadically observed (see {Chapters.3 Chapter 3} and {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_3.9_4_2_3_1 Section 9.4.2.3.1}). Continuous AMOC time series now exist for latitudes 41°N (reconstructions since 1993) and 26.5°N (estimate based on direct observations since 2004) (Cunningham et al., 2010; {cite.9.'Willis_2010}). At 26.5°N, CMIP3 and CMIP5 model simulations show total AMOC variability that is within the observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} ({cite.9.'Baehr_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Marsh_et_al_2009}; Balan Sarojini et al., 2011; {cite.9.'Msadek_et_al_2013}). However, the total AMOC is the sum of a wind-driven component and a mid-ocean geostrophic component. While both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models tend to overestimate the wind-driven variability, they tend to underestimate the mid-ocean geostrophic variability ({cite.9.'Baehr_et_al_2009}; Balan Sarojini et al., 2011; {cite.9.'Msadek_et_al_2013}). The latter is suggested to result from deficiencies in the simulation of the hydrographic characteristics ({cite.9.'Baehr_et_al_2009}), specifically the Nordic Seas overflows ({cite.9.'Yeager_and_Danabasoglu_2012}; {cite.9.'Msadek_et_al_2013}).
