section 9_5_3_3_1

  |At 26.5Â°N, CMIP3 and CMIP5 model simulations show total AMOC variability that is within the observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty}. However, the total AMOC is the sum of a wind-driven component and a mid-ocean geostrophic component. Models tend to overestimate the wind-driven variability and underestimate the mid-ocean geostrophic variability.
