section 9_5_3_3_3

  |The Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) is the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical Atlantic. Virtually all CMIP models simulate AMMlike {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} variability in their 20th century climate simulations. However, spurious AMM behaviour in the models is expected to be associated with the severe model biases in simulating the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}. CMIP3 models have considerable difficulty simulating Atlantic NinÌƒo in their 20th century climate simulations.
