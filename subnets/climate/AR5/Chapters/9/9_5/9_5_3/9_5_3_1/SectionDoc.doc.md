title: 9.5.3.1 - Global Surface Temperature Multi-Decadal Variability

The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that modelled global temperature variance at decadal to inter-decadal time scales was consistent with 20th century observations. In addition, results from the last millennium suggest that simulated variability is consistent with indirect estimates ({cite.9.'Hegerl_et_al_2007}).

{'Figure_9_33 Figure 9.33}a shows simulated {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} of mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} from CMIP5 pre-industrial control simulations. {Glossary.*Model_spread Model spread} is largest in the tropics and mid to high latitudes ({cite.9.'Jones_et_al_2012}), where variability is also large; however, compared to CMIP3, the spread is smaller in the tropics owing to improved representation of {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} variability ({cite.9.'Jones_et_al_2012}). The power spectral density of global mean temperature variance in the historical simulations is shown in {'Figure_9_33 Figure 9.33}b and is generally consistent with the observational estimates.

At longer time scale of the spectra estimated from last millennium simulations, performed with a subset of the CMIP5 models, can be assessed by comparison with different NH temperature {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records ({'Figure_9_33 Figure 9.33}c; see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} for details). The CMIP5 millennium simulations include natural and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} (solar, volcanic, {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, land use) ({cite.9.'Schmidt_et_al_2012}). Significant differences between unforced and forced simulations are seen for time scale larger than 50 years, indicating the importance of forced variability at these time scales (Fernandez-Donado et al., 2013). It should be noted that a few models exhibit slow background climate drift which increases the spread in variance estimates at multi-century time scales. Nevertheless, the lines of evidence above suggest with high confidence that models reproduce global and NH temperature variability on a wide range of time scales.
