  |The representation of {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} has steadily improved and now bears considerable similarity to observed ENSO properties. However, simulations of both background climate and {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} exhibit serious systematic errors. Some modes of the Indian Ocean basin are captured by CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, with some discrepancies. The tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO) has been simulated in a number of global coupled climate model simulations.
