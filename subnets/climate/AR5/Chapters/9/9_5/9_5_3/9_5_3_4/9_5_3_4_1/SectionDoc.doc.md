title: 9.5.3.4.1 - El Niño-Southern Oscillation

The {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} phenomenon is the dominant mode of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} on seasonal to interannual time scales (see {cite.9.'Wang_and_Picaut_2004 Wang and Picaut (2004)} and {Chapters.14 Chapter 14}). The representation of ENSO in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} has steadily improved and now bears considerable similarity to observed ENSO properties ({cite.9.'AchutaRao_and_Sperber_2002}; {cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_et_al_2009b}). However, as was the case in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, simulations of both background climate (time mean and seasonal cycle, see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_5.9_4_2_5_1 Section 9.4.2.5.1}) and internal variability exhibit serious systematic errors (van Oldenborgh et al., 2005; {cite.9.'Capotondi_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_2006}; {cite.9.'Wittenberg_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Watanabe_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Stevenson_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Yeh_et_al_2012}), many of which can be traced to the representation of deep {Glossary.*Convection convection}, trade wind strength and cloud feedbacks, with little improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5 ({cite.9.'Braconnot_et_al_2007a}; L’Ecuyer and Stephens, 2007; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_et_al_2009a}; {cite.9.'Lloyd_et_al_2009}, 2010; {cite.9.'Sun_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Zhang_and_Jin_2012}).

While a number of CMIP3 models do not exhibit an ENSO variability maximum at the observed 2to 7year time scale, most CMIP5 models do have a maximum near the observed range and fewer models have the tendency for biennial oscillations ({'Figure_9_35 Figure 9.35}; see also {cite.9.'Stevenson_2012}). In CMIP3 the amplitude of El Niño ranged from less than half to more than double the observed amplitude (van Oldenborgh et al., 2005; {cite.9.'AchutaRao_and_Sperber_2006}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_2006}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_et_al_2009b}). By contrast, the CMIP5 models show less inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} ({'Figure_9_36 Figure 9.36}; {cite.9.'Kim_and_Yu_2012}). The CMIP5 models still exhibit errors in ENSO amplitude, period, irregularity, skewness, spatial patterns ({cite.9.'Lin_2007}; {cite.9.'Leloup_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_et_al_2009b}; {cite.9.'Ohba_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Yu_and_Kim_2011}; {cite.9.'Su_and_Jiang_2012}) or teleconnections ({cite.9.'Watanabe_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Weller_and_Cai_2013a}).

Since AR4, new analysis methods have emerged and are now being applied. For example, {cite.9.'Jin_et_al_2006 Jin et al. (2006)} and {cite.9.'Kim_and_Jin_2011a Kim and Jin (2011a)} identified five different feedbacks affecting the Bjerknes (or BJ) index, which in turn characterizes ENSO stability. {cite.9.'Kim_and_Jin_2011b Kim and Jin (2011b)} applied this process-based analysis to the CMIP3 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} and demonstrated a significant positive correlation between ENSO amplitude and the BJ index. When respective components of the BJ index obtained from the coupled models were compared with those from observations, it was shown that most coupled models underestimated the negative thermal damping {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({cite.9.'Lloyd_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Chen_et_al_2013}) and the positive zonal advective and {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} feedbacks.

Detailed quantitative evaluation of ENSO performance is hampered by the short observational record of key processes ({cite.9.'Wittenberg_2009}; {cite.9.'Li_et_al_2011b}; {cite.9.'Deser_et_al_2012}) and the complexity and diversity of the processes involved ({cite.9.'Wang_and_Picaut_2004}). While shortcomings remain ({cite.9.'Guilyardi_et_al_2009b}), the CMIP5 model ensemble shows some improvement compared to CMIP3, but there has been no major breakthrough and the multi-model improvement is mostly due to a reduced number of poor-performing models.
