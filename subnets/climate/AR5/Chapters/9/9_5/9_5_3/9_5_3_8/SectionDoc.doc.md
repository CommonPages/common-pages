title: 9.5.3.8 - Summary

In summary, most modes of interannual to interdecadal variability are now present in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. As in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, their assessment presents a varied picture and CMIP5 models only show a modest improvement over CMIP3, mostly due to fewer poor-performing models. New since the AR4, process-based model evaluation is now helping identify sources of specific biases, although the observational record is often too short or inaccurate to offer strong constraints. The assessment of modes and patterns is summarized in {'Table_9_4 Table 9.4}.
