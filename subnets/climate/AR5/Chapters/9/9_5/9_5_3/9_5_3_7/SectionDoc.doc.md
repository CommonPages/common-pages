title: 9.5.3.7 - The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation

Significant progress has been made in recent years to model and understand the impacts of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ({Glossary.*Quasi_Biennal_Oscillation QBO}; {cite.9.'Baldwin_et_al_2001}). Many {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} have now increased their vertical domain and/or improved their physical parameterizations (see {'Table_9_1 Tables 9.1} and 9.A.1), and some of these reproduce a QBO (e.g., HadGEM2, MPI-{Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESM}-LR, MIROC). Many features of the QBO such as its width and phase asymmetry also appear spontaneously in these simulations due to internal dynamics ({cite.9.'Dunkerton_1991}; {cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2002}; {cite.9.'Haynes_2006}). Some of the QBO effects on the extratropical climate ({cite.9.'Holton_and_Tan_1980}; {cite.9.'Hamilton_1998}; {cite.9.'Naoe_and_Shibata_2010}) as well as {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({cite.9.'Butchart_et_al_2003}; {cite.9.'Shibata_and_Deushi_2005}) are also reproduced in models.
