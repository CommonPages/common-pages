title: 9.5.3 - Interannual-to-Centennial Variability

In addition to the annual, intra-seasonal and diurnal cycles described above, a number of other {Topics.*Climate_Variability modes of variability} arise on multi-annual to multi-decadal time scales (see also {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}). Most of these modes have a particular regional manifestation whose amplitude can be larger than that of human-induced climate change. The observational record is usually too short to fully evaluate the representation of variability in models and this motivates the use of {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} or proxies, even though these have their own limitations.
