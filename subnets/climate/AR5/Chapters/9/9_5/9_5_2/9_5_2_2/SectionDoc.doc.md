title: 9.5.2.2 - Blocking

In the mid latitudes, climate is often characterized by weather regimes (see {Chapters.2 Chapter 2}), amongst which blocking regimes play a role in the occurrence of {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme weather} events ({cite.9.'Buehler_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Sillmann_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Pfahl_and_Wernli_2012}). During blocking, the prevailing mid-latitude westerly winds and storm systems are interrupted by a local reversal of the zonal flow. {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} in the past have universally underestimated the occurrence of blocking, in particular in the Euro-Atlantic sector ({cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2010}).

There are important differences in methods used to identify blocking ({cite.9.'Barriopedro_et_al_2010a}), and the diagnosed blocking frequency can be very sensitive to details such as the choice of latitude ({cite.9.'Barnes_et_al_2012}). {Glossary.*Blocking Blocking} indices can be sensitive to biases in the representation of mean state ({cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2010}) or in variability ({cite.9.'Barriopedro_et_al_2010b}; {cite.9.'Vial_and_Osborn_2012}). When blocking is measured via anomaly fields, rather than reversed absolute fields, model skill can be high even in relatively low-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} models (e.g., Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli, 2009).

Recent work has shown that models with high horizontal ({cite.9.'Matsueda_2009}; {cite.9.'Matsueda_et_al_2009}, 2010) or vertical resolution ({cite.9.'Anstey_et_al_2013}) are better able to simulate blocking. These improvement arise from increased representation of orography and atmospheric dynamics ({cite.9.'Woollings_et_al_2010b}; {cite.9.'Jung_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Berckmans_et_al_2013}), as well as reduced ocean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} errors in the extra tropics ({cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2011}). Improved physical parameterizations have also been shown to improve simulations of blocking ({cite.9.'Jung_et_al_2010}). However, as in CMIP3 ({cite.9.'Scaife_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Barnes_et_al_2012}), most of the CMIP5 models still significantly underestimate winter Euro-Atlantic blocking ({cite.9.'Anstey_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Masato_et_al_2012}; Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013). These new results show that the representation of blocking events is improving in models, even though the overall quality of CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} is medium. There is high confidence that model representation of blocking is improved through increases in model resolution.
