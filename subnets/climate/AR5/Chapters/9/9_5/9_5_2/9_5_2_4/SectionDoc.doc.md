title: 9.5.2.4 - Large-Scale Monsoon Rainfall and Circulation

Monsoons are the dominant modes of annual variation in the tropics ({cite.9.'Trenberth_et_al_2000}; {cite.9.'Wang_and_Ding_2008}), and affect weather and climate in numerous regions ({Chapters.14 Chapter 14}). High-fidelity simulation of the mean {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} and its variability is of great importance for simulating future climate impacts ({cite.9.'Wang_2006}; {cite.9.'Sperber_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Colman_et_al_2011}; Turner and Annamalai, 2012). The monsoon is characterized by an annual reversal of the low level winds and well defined dry and wet seasons ({cite.9.'Wang_and_Ding_2008}), and its variability is primarily connected to the {Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO} and {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 Section 9.5.3}). The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} reported that most CMIP3 models poorly represent the characteristics of the monsoon and monsoon teleconnections ({cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2007}), though improvement in CMIP5 has been noted for the mean climate, seasonal cycle, intraseasonal and interannual variability ({cite.9.'Sperber_et_al_2012}).

The different monsoon systems are connected through the large-scale tropical circulation, offering the possibility to evaluate a models’ representation of monsoon domain and intensity through the global monsoon concept ({cite.9.'Wang_and_Ding_2008}; {cite.9.'Wang_et_al_2011a}). The CMIP5 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} generally reproduces the observed spatial patterns but somewhat underestimates the extent and intensity, especially over Asia and North America ({'Figure_9_32 Figure 9.32}). The best model has similar performance to the multi-model mean, whereas the poorest models fail to capture the monsoon precipitation domain and intensity over Asia and the western Pacific, Central America, and Australia. {cite.9.'Fan_et_al_2010 Fan et al. (2010)} also show that CMIP3 simulations capture the observed {Glossary.*Trend trend} of weakening of the South Asian summer circulation over the past half century, but are unable to reproduce the magnitude of the observed trend in precipitation. On longer time scales, mid-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} simulations show that even though models capture the sign of the monsoon precipitation changes, they tend to underestimate its magnitude ({cite.9.'Braconnot_et_al_2007b}; {cite.9.'Zhao_and_Harrison_2012})

Poor simulation of the monsoon has been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to cold {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} biases over the Arabian Sea ({cite.9.'Levine_and_Turner_2012}), a weak meridional temperature gradient ({cite.9.'Joseph_et_al_2012}), unrealistic development of the Indian Ocean dipole ({cite.9.'Achuthavarier_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Boschat_et_al_2012}) and changes to the circulation through excessive precipitation over the southwest equatorial Indian Ocean ({cite.9.'Bollasina_and_Ming_2013}). These biases lead to too weak inland moisture transport and an underestimate of monsoon precipitation over India. Similar SST biases contribute to model-data mismatch in the simulation of the mid-Holocene Asian monsoon (Ohgaito and Abe-Ouchi, 2009), even though the representation of atmospheric processes such as {Glossary.*Convection convection} seems to dominate the {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} (Ohgaito and Abe-Ouchi, 2009) or over Africa ({cite.9.'Zheng_and_Braconnot_2013}). Factors that have contributed to improved representation of the monsoon in some CMIP5 models include better simulation of topography-related monsoon precipitation due to higher horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ({cite.9.'Mizuta_et_al_2012}), a more realistic ENSO–monsoon {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} ({cite.9.'Meehl_et_al_2012}) and improved propagation of intraseasonal variations ({cite.9.'Sperber_and_Kim_2012}). The impact of aerosols on monsoon precipitation and its variability is the subject of ongoing investigation ({cite.9.'Lau_et_al_2008}).

These results provide robust evidence that CMIP5 models simulate more realistic monsoon climatology and variability than their CMIP3 predecessors, but they still suffer from biases in the representation of the monsoon domain and intensity leading to medium model quality at the global scale and declining quality at the regional scale.
