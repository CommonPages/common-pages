title: 9.5.2.1 - Diurnal Cycles of Temperature and Precipitation

The diurnally varying {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} received at a given location drives, through complex interactions with the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, land surface and upper ocean, easily observable diurnal variations in surface and near-{Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature}, precipitation, level stability and winds. The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} noted that {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} simulated the global pattern of the {Glossary.*Diurnal_temperature_range diurnal temperature range}, zonally and annually averaged over the continent, but tended to underestimate its magnitude in many regions ({cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2007}). New analyses over land indicate that model deficiencies in surface–{Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} interactions and the planetary boundary layer are also expected to contribute to some of the diurnal cycle errors and that model agreement with observations depends on {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, vegetation type and season ({cite.9.'Lindvall_et_al_2012}). Analyses of CMIP3 simulations show that the diurnal amplitude of precipitation is realistic, but most models tend to start moist {Glossary.*Convection convection} prematurely over land ({cite.9.'Dai_2006}; {cite.9.'Wang_et_al_2011a}). Many CMIP5 models also have peak precipitation several hours too early compared to surface observations and TRMM satellite observations ({'Figure_9_30 Figure 9.30}). This and the so-called ‘drizzling bias’ ({cite.9.'Dai_2006}) can have large adverse impacts on surface evaporation and {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} ({cite.9.'Qian_et_al_2006}). Over the ocean, models often rain too frequently and underestimated the diurnal amplitude ({cite.9.'Stephens_et_al_2010}). It has also been suggested that a weak diurnal cycle of surface air temperature is produced over the ocean because of a lack of diurnal variations in {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} ({cite.9.'Bernie_et_al_2008}), and most models have difficulty with this due to coarse vertical {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} and coupling frequency ({cite.9.'Dai_and_Trenberth_2004}; {cite.9.'Danabasoglu_et_al_2006}).

Improved representation of the diurnal cycle has been found with increased atmospheric resolution ({cite.9.'Sato_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Ploshay_and_Lau_2010}) or with improved representation of cloud physics ({cite.9.'Khairoutdinov_et_al_2005}), but the reasons for these improvements remain poorly understood. Other changes such as the representation of entrainment in deep convection ({cite.9.'Stratton_and_Stirling_2012}), improved coupling between shallow and deep convection, and inclusion of density currents ({cite.9.'Peterson_et_al_2009}) have been shown to greatly improve the diurnal cycle of convection over tropical land and provide a good representation of the timing of convection over land in coupled ocean– atmosphere simulations ({cite.9.'Hourdin_et_al_2013}). Thanks to improvements like this, the best performing models in {'Figure_9_30 Figure 9.30} appear now to be able to capture the land and ocean diurnal phase and amplitude quite well.
