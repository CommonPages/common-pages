title: 9.5.2.3 - Madden–Julian Oscillation

During the boreal winter the eastward propagating feature known as the Madden–Julian Oscillation ({Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO}; ({cite.9.'Madden_and_Julian_1972}, 1994) predominantly affects the deep tropics, while during the boreal summer there is also northward propagation over much of southern Asia ({cite.9.'Annamalai_and_Sperber_2005}). The MJO has received much attention given the prominent role it plays in tropical {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} (e.g., monsoons, {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, and mid-latitudes; {cite.9.'Lau_and_Waliser_2011}) Phenomenological diagnostics ({cite.9.'Waliser_et_al_2009a}) and process-oriented diagnostics (e.g., {cite.9.'Xavier_2012}) have been used to evaluate MJO in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. An important reason for model errors in representing the MJO is that {Glossary.*Convection convection} parameterizations do not provide sufficient build-up of moisture in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} for the large scale organized convection to occur ({cite.9.'Kim_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Mizuta_et_al_2012}). Biases in the model mean state also contribute to poor MJO simulation ({cite.9.'Inness_et_al_2003}). High-frequency coupling with the ocean is also an important factor ({cite.9.'Bernie_et_al_2008}). While new parameterizations of convection may improve the MJO ({cite.9.'Hourdin_et_al_2013}), this sometimes occurs at the expense of a good simulation of the mean tropical climate ({cite.9.'Kim_et_al_2012}). In addition, high {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} models with an improved diurnal cycle do not necessarily produce an improved MJO ({cite.9.'Mizuta_et_al_2012}).

Most models underestimate the strength and the coherence of convection and wind variability ({cite.9.'Lin_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Lin_and_Li_2008}). The simplified {Glossary.*Metric metric} shown in {'Figure_9_31 Figure 9.31} provides a synthesis of CMIP3 and CMIP5 model results ({cite.9.'Sperber_and_Kim_2012}). It shows that simulation of the MJO is still a challenge for climate models ({cite.9.'Lin_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Kim_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Xavier_et_al_2010}). Most models have weak coherence in their MJO propagation (smaller maximum positive correlation). Even so, relative to CMIP3 there has been improvement in CMIP5 in simulating the eastward propagation of boreal winter MJO convection from the Indian Ocean into the western Pacific ({cite.9.'Hung_et_al_2013}) and northward propagation during boreal summer ({cite.9.'Sperber_et_al_2012}). In addition there is evidence that models reproduce MJO characteristics in the east Pacific ({cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012b}), and that, overall, there is improvement compared to previous generations of climate models ({cite.9.'Waliser_et_al_2003}; {cite.9.'Lin_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Sperber_and_Annamalai_2008}).
