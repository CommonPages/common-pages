title: 9.5.1 - Importance of Simulating Climate Variability

The ability of a model to simulate the mean climate, and the slow, externally forced change in that mean state, was evaluated in the previous section. However, the ability to simulate {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, both unforced internal variability and forced variability (e.g., diurnal and seasonal cycles) is also important. This has implications for the signal-to-noise estimates inherent in climate change {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies} where low-frequency climate variability must be estimated, at least in part, from long control integrations of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}). It also has implications for the ability of models to make quantitative {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of changes in climate variability and the statistics of {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} under a warming climate. In many cases, the impacts of climate change will be experienced more profoundly in terms of the frequency, intensity or duration of extreme events (e.g., heat waves, droughts, extreme rainfall events; see {Chapters.12.12_4 Section 12.4}). The ability to simulate climate variability is also central to achieving skill in climate {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} by initializing models from the observed climate state (Sections {Chapters.11.11_1 11.1} and {Chapters.11.11_2 11.2}).

Evaluating model simulations of climate variability also provides a means to explore the representation of certain processes, such as the coupled processes underlying the {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and other important modes of variability. A model’s representation of the diurnal or seasonal cycle— both of which represent responses to external (rotational or orbital) {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} – may also provide some insight into a model’s ‘sensitivity’ and by extension, the ability to respond correctly to GHG, {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}, volcanic and solar forcing.
