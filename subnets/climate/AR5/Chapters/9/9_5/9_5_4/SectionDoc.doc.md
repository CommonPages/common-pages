title: 9.5.4 - Extreme Events

Extreme events are realizations of the tail of the probability distribution of weather and {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. They are higher-order statistics and thus generally more difficult to realistically represent in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. Shorter time scale {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} are often associated with smaller scale spatial structure, which may be better represented as model {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} increases. In the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, it was concluded that models could simulate the statistics of extreme events better than expected from the generally coarse resolution of the models at that time, especially for temperature extremes ({cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2007}).

The IPCC has conducted an assessment of extreme events in the context of climate changeâ€”the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) ({cite.9.'IPCC_2012}). Although there is no comprehensive climate model evaluation with respect to extreme events in SREX, there is some consideration of model performance taken into account in assessing {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}.
