title: 9.5.4.5 - Summary

There is medium evidence (i.e., a few multi-model studies) and high agreement that the global distribution of {Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} are represented well by CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. The observed global warming {Glossary.*Trend trend} of temperature extremes in the second half of the 20th century is reproduced in models, but there is medium evidence (a few CMIP3 studies) and medium agreement (not evident in a preliminary look at CMIP5) that models tend to overestimate the warming of warm temperature extremes and underestimate the warming of cold temperature extremes.

There is medium evidence (single multi-model study) and medium agreement (as inter-model difference is large) that CMIP5 models tend to simulate more intense and thus more realistic precipitation extremes than CMIP3, which could be partly due to generally higher horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution}. There is medium evidence and high agreement that CMIP3 models tend to underestimate the sensitivity of extreme precipitation intensity to temperature. There is medium evidence and high agreement that high resolution (50 km or finer) AGCMs tend to simulate the intensity of extreme precipitation comparable to observational estimates.

There is medium evidence and high agreement that year-to-year count variability of Atlantic hurricanes can be well simulated by modestly high resolution (100 km or finer) AGCMs forced by observed SSTs. There is medium evidence and medium agreement (as inter-model difference is large) that the intensity of tropical cyclones is too weak in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Finally, there is medium evidence (a few multi-model studies) and medium agreement (as it might depend on definitions of {Glossary.*Drought drought}) that models can simulate aspects of largescale drought.
