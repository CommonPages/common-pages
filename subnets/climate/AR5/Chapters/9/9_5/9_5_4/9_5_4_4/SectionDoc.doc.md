title: 9.5.4.4 - Droughts

{Glossary.*Drought Drought} is caused by long time scale (months or longer) variability of both precipitation and evaporation. {cite.9.'Sheffield_and_Wood_2008 Sheffield and Wood (2008)} found that models in the CMIP3 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} simulated large-scale droughts in the 20th century reasonably well, in the sense that multi-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} includes the observational estimate in each of several regions. However, it should be noted that there are various definitions of drought (see {Chapters.2 Chapter 2} and {cite.9.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}) and the performance of simulated drought can depend on the definition. Moreover, different models can simulate drought with different mechanisms ({cite.9.'McCrary_and_Randall_2010}; {cite.9.'Taylor_et_al_2012a}). A comprehensive evaluation of CMIP5 models for drought is currently not available, although {cite.9.'Sillmann_et_al_2013 Sillmann et al. (2013)} found that consecutive dry days simulated by CMIP5 models are comparable to observations in magnitude and distribution.
