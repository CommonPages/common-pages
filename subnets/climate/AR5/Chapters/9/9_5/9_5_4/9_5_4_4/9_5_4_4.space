section 9_5_4_4

  |Models in the CMIP3 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} simulated large-scale droughts in the 20th century reasonably well. It should be noted that there are various definitions of {Glossary.*Drought drought} and the performance of simulated drought can depend on the definition. A comprehensive evaluation of CMIP5 models for drought is currently not available.
