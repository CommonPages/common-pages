title: 9.5.4.3 - Tropical Cyclones

It was concluded in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} that high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} AGCMs generally reproduced the frequency and distribution, but underestimated intensity of tropical cyclones ({cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2007}). Since then, {cite.9.'Mizuta_et_al_2012 Mizuta et al. (2012)} have shown that a newer version of the MRI-AGCM with improved parameterizations (at 20 km horizontal resolution) simulates tropical cyclones as intense as those observed with improved distribution as well. Another remarkable finding since the AR4 is that the observed year-to-year count variability of Atlantic hurricanes can be well simulated by modestly high resolution (100 km or finer) AGCMs forced by observed {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}, though with less skill in other basins ({cite.9.'Larow_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Zhao_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Strachan_et_al_2013}). Vortices that have some characteristics of tropical cyclones can also be detected and tracked in {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} in CMIP3 and 5, but their intensities are generally too weak ({cite.9.'Yokoi_et_al_2009a}; {cite.9.'Yokoi_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Tory_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Walsh_et_al_2013}).
