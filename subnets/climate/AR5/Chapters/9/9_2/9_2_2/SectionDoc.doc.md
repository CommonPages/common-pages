title: 9.2.2 - Ensemble Approaches for Model Evaluation

{Glossary.*Ensemble Ensemble} methods are used to explore the uncertainty in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} simulations that arise from {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}, boundary conditions, parameter values for a given model structure or structural uncertainty due to different model formulations ({cite.9.'Tebaldi_and_Knutti_2007}; {cite.9.'Hawkins_and_Sutton_2009}; {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010a}). Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, techniques have been designed to specifically evaluate model performance of individual ensemble members. Although this is typically done to better characterize {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, the methods and insights are applicable to model evaluation in general. The ensembles are generally of two types: Multi-model Ensembles (MMEs) and Perturbed Parameter (or Physics) Ensembles (PPEs).
