title: 9.2.2.1 - Multi-Model Ensembles

The MME is created from existing model simulations from multiple climate modelling centres. MMEs sample structural {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} and {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability}. However, the sample size of MMEs is small, and is confounded because some {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} have been developed by sharing model components leading to shared biases ({cite.9.'Masson_and_Knutti_2011a}). Thus, MME members cannot be treated as purely independent, which implies a reduction in the effective number of independent models ({cite.9.'Tebaldi_and_Knutti_2007}; {cite.9.'Jun_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Knutti_2010}; {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010a}; {cite.9.'Pennell_and_Reichler_2011}).
