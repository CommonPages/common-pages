title: 9.2.1.2 - Isolating Processes

To understand the cause of model errors it is necessary to evaluate the representation of processes both in the context of the full model and in isolation. A number of evaluation techniques to achieve both process and component isolation have been developed. One involves the so-called ‘regime-oriented’ approach to process evaluation. Instead of averaging model results in time (e.g., seasonal averages) or space (e.g., global averages), results are averaged within categories that describe physically distinct regimes of the system. Applications of this approach since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} include the use of circulation regimes ({cite.9.'Bellucci_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Brown_et_al_2010b}; {cite.9.'Brient_and_Bony_2012}; {cite.9.'Ichikawa_et_al_2012}), cloud regimes ({cite.9.'Williams_and_Brooks_2008}; Chen and Del Genio, 2009; {cite.9.'Williams_and_Webb_2009}; {cite.9.'Tsushima_et_al_2013}) and thermodynamic states ({cite.9.'Sahany_et_al_2012}; Su, 2012). The application of new observations, such as vertically resolved cloud and water vapour information from satellites ({cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a}; {cite.9.'Konsta_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Quaas_2012}) and water {Glossary.*Isotopes isotopes} ({cite.9.'Risi_et_al_2012a}; {cite.9.'Risi_et_al_2012b}), has also enhanced the ability to evaluate processes in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.

Another approach involves the isolation of model components or parameterizations in off-line simulations, such as Single Column Models of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. Results of such simulations are compared to measurements from field studies or to results of more detailed process models ({cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2003}). Numerous process evaluation data sets have been collected since the AR4 ({cite.9.'Redelsperger_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Illingworth_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Verlinde_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'May_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Wood_et_al_2011}) and have been applied to the evaluation of climate model processes ({cite.9.'Xie_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Boone_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Boyle_and_Klein_2010}; {cite.9.'Hourdin_et_al_2010}). These studies are crucial to test the realism of the process formulations that underpin climate models.
