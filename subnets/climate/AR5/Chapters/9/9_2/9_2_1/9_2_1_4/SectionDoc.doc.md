title: 9.2.1.4 - Initial Value Techniques

To be able to forecast the weather a few days ahead, knowledge of the present state of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is of primary importance. In contrast, {Topics.*Climate_Predictions climate predictions} and projections simulate the statistics of weather seasons to centuries in advance. Despite their differences, both weather predictions and {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate} are performed with very similar atmospheric model components. The atmospheric component of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} can be integrated as a weather prediction model if initialized appropriately ({cite.9.'Phillips_et_al_2004}). This allows testing parameterized sub-grid scale processes without the complication of feedbacks substantially altering the underlying state of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}.

The application of these techniques since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} has led to some new insights. For example, many of the systematic errors in the modelled climate develop within a few days of simulation, highlighting the important role of fast, parameterized processes ({cite.9.'Klein_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Boyle_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Xie_et_al_2012}). Errors in cloud properties for example were shown to be present within a few days in a forecast in at least some models ({cite.9.'Williams_and_Brooks_2008}), although this was not the case in another model ({cite.9.'Boyle_and_Klein_2010}; {cite.9.'Zhang_et_al_2010b}). Other studies have highlighted the advantage of such methodologies for the detailed evaluation of model processes using observations that are available only for limited locations and times ({cite.9.'Williamson_and_Olson_2007}; Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2008; {cite.9.'Xie_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Hannay_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Boyle_and_Klein_2010}), an approach that is difficult to apply to long-term climate simulations.
