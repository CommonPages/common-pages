title: 9.6.4 - Value Added through RCMs

{Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} are regularly tested to evaluate whether they show improvements over global models ({cite.9.'Laprise_et_al_2008}), that is, whether they do indeed ‘add value’. In essence, added value is a measure of the extent to which the downscaled climate is closer to observations than the model from which the boundary conditions were obtained. Differences between RCM and {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations are not always very obvious for time-averaged quantities on larger scales or in fairly homogeneous regions. RCM fields are, however, richer in spatial and temporal detail. Indeed, the added value of RCMs is mainly expected in the simulation of topography-influenced phenomena and extremes with relatively small spatial or short temporal character (e.g., {cite.9.'Feser_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Feser_and_Barcikowska_2012}; Shkol’nik et al., 2012). As an example, RCM {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} led to better large-scale {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} precipitation patterns ({cite.9.'Gao_et_al_2012}) for East Asia than in the global models used for boundary conditions. In the few instances where RCMs have been interactively coupled to global models (i.e., ‘two-way’ coupling), the effects of improved small scales propagate to larger scales and this has been found to improve the simulation of larger scale phenomena ({cite.9.'Lorenz_and_Jacob_2005}; {cite.9.'Inatsu_and_Kimoto_2009}; {cite.9.'Inatsu_et_al_2012}).

Other examples include improved simulation of convective precipitation ({cite.9.'Rauscher_et_al_2010}), near-{Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} ({cite.9.'Feser_2006}), near-{Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} and wind ({cite.9.'Kanamaru_and_Kanamitsu_2007}), temperature and precipitation (Lucas-Picher et al., 2012b), extreme precipitation ({cite.9.'Kanada_et_al_2008}), coastal climate features ({cite.9.'Winterfeldt_and_Weisse_2009}; {cite.9.'Winterfeldt_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Kawazoe_and_Gutowski_2013}; {cite.9.'Vautard_et_al_2013}), Atlantic hurricanes ({cite.9.'Bender_et_al_2010}), European storm damage ({cite.9.'Donat_et_al_2010}), strong mesoscale cyclones ({cite.9.'Cavicchia_and_Storch_2011}), cutoff lows ({cite.9.'Grose_et_al_2012}), polar lows (Zahn and von Storch, 2008) and higher statistical moments of the water budget (e.g., {cite.9.'Bresson_and_Laprise_2011}).

In summary, there is high confidence that downscaling adds value to the simulation of spatial climate detail in regions with highly variable topography (e.g., distinct orography, coastlines) and for mesoscale phenomena and extremes. Regional downscaling is therefore complementary to results obtained directly from global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. These results are from a variety of distinct studies with different RCMs.
