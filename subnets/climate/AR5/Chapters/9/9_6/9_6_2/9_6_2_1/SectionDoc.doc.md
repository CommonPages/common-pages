title: 9.6.2.1 - Recent Developments of Statistical Methods

The development of SD since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} has been quite vigorous (e.g., {cite.9.'Fowler_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Maraun_et_al_2010b}), and many state-of-the-art approaches combine different methods (e.g., {cite.9.'Vrac_and_Naveau_2008}; van Vliet et al., 2011). There is an increasing number of studies on extremes (e.g., {cite.9.'Vrac_and_Naveau_2008}; {cite.9.'Wang_and_Zhang_2008}), and on features such as hurricanes ({cite.9.'Emanuel_et_al_2008}), river flow and discharge, sediment, soil erosion and crop yields (e.g., {cite.9.'Zhang_2007}; {cite.9.'Prudhomme_and_Davies_2009}; {cite.9.'Lewis_and_Lamoureux_2010}). Techniques have also been developed to consider multiple climatic variables simultaneously in order to preserve some physical consistency (e.g., {cite.9.'Zhang_and_Georgakakos_2011}). The methods used to evaluate SD approaches vary with the downscaled variable and include metrics related to intensities (e.g., {cite.9.'Ning_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Tryhorn_and_DeGaetano_2011}), temporal behaviour (e.g., {cite.9.'May_2007}; {cite.9.'Timbal_and_Jones_2008}; {cite.9.'Maraun_et_al_2010a}; {cite.9.'Brands_et_al_2011}), and physical processes (Lenderink and Van Meijgaard, 2008; {cite.9.'Maraun_et_al_2010a}). SD capabilities are also examined through secondary variables like {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, {Glossary.*River_discharge river discharge} and stream flow (e.g., {cite.9.'Boe_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Teutschbein_et_al_2011}).
