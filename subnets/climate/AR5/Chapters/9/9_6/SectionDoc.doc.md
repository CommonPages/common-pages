title: 9.6 - Downscaling and Simulation of Regional-Scale Climate

Regional-scale climate information can be obtained directly from global models; however, their horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} is often too low to resolve features that are important at regional scales. High-resolution AGCMs, variable-resolution global models, and statistical and dynamical {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} (i.e., {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} modelling) are used to complement {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}, and to generate region-specific climate information. These approaches are evaluated in the following.
