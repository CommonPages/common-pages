title: 9.6.1.3 - Regional-Scale Simulation by Variable-Resolution Global Climate Models

An alternative to global high {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} is the use of variable resolution (so-called ‘stretched grid’) models with higher resolution over the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of interest. Some examples are {cite.9.'Abiodun_et_al_2011 Abiodun et al. (2011)} who showed that such simulations improve the simulation of West African {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} systems and African easterly jets, and {cite.9.'White_et_al_2013 White et al. (2013)} who demonstrated improvements in temperature and precipitation related extreme indices. Fox-Rabinovitz et al. (2008) showed that regional biases in the high-resolution portion of a stretched grid model were similar to that of a global model with the same high resolution everywhere. {cite.9.'Markovic_et_al_2010 Markovic et al. (2010)} and Déqué (2010) reported similar results. Although not widely used, such methods can complement more conventional {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.
