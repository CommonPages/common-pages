title: 9.1.3.1 - Parameterizations

Parameterizations are included in all model components to represent processes that cannot be explicitly resolved; they are evaluated both in isolation and in the context of the full model. The purpose of this section is to highlight recent developments in the parameterizations employed in each model component. Some details for individual models are listed in {'Table_9_1 Table 9.1}.
