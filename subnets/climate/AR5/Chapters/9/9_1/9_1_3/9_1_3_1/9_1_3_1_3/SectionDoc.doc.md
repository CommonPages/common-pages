title: 9.1.3.1.3 - Land

Land surface properties such as vegetation, soil type and the amount of water stored on the land as {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}, snow and groundwater all strongly influence climate, particularly through their effects on surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration}. These climatic effects can be profound; for example, it has been suggested that changes in the state of the land surface may have played an important part in the severity and length of the 2003 European {Glossary.*Drought drought} ({cite.9.'Fischer_et_al_2007}), and that more than 60% of the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} increase in interannual summer temperature variability in Europe is due to soil moisture–temperature feedbacks ({cite.9.'Seneviratne_et_al_2006}).

Land surface schemes calculate the fluxes of heat, water and momentum between the land and the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. At the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, even the more advanced land surface schemes suffered from obvious simplifications, such as the need to prescribe rather than simulate the vegetation cover and a tendency to ignore lateral flows of water and sub-gridscale heterogeneity in soil moisture ({cite.9.'Pitman_2003}). Since the AR4, a number of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} have included some representation of vegetation dynamics (see Sections {Chapters.9.9_1.9_1_3.9_1_3_2.9_1_3_2_5 9.1.3.2.5} and {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_4.9_4_4_3 9.4.4.3}), land– {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} exchange (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_5 Section 9.4.5}), sub-gridscale hydrology ({cite.9.'Oleson_et_al_2008b}) and changes in land use (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_4.9_4_4_4 Section 9.4.4.4}).
