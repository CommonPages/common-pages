title: 9.1.3.1.2 - Ocean

Ocean components in contemporary {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} generally have horizontal resolutions that are too coarse to admit mesoscale eddies. Consequently, such models typically employ some version of the Redi ({cite.9.'Redi_1982}) neutral diffusion and Gent and McWilliams ({cite.9.'Gent_and_McWilliams_1990}) eddy {Glossary.*Advection advection} {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} (see also {cite.9.'Gent_et_al_1995}; {cite.9.'McDougall_and_McIntosh_2001}). Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, a focus has been on how parameterized mesoscale eddy fluxes in the ocean interior interact with boundary layer turbulence ({cite.9.'Gnanadesikan_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Danabasoglu_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Ferrari_et_al_2008}, 2010). Another focus concerns eddy diffusivity, with many CMIP5 models employing flow-dependent schemes. Both of these refinements are important for the mean state and the response to changing {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}, especially in the Southern Ocean ({cite.9.'Hallberg_and_Gnanadesikan_2006}; {cite.9.'Boning_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Farneti_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Farneti_and_Gent_2011}; {cite.9.'Gent_and_Danabasoglu_2011}; Hofmann and Morales Maqueda, 2011).

In addition to mesoscale eddies, there has been a growing awareness of the role that sub-mesoscale eddies and fronts play in restratifying the mixed layer ({cite.9.'Boccaletti_et_al_2007}; Fox-Kemper et al., 2008; {cite.9.'Klein_and_Lapeyre_2009}), and the parameterization of Fox-Kemper et al. (2011) is now used in some CMIP5 models.

There is an active research effort on the representation of dianeutral mixing associated with breaking gravity waves (MacKinnon et al., 2009), with this work adding rigour to the prototype energetically consistent abyssal tidal mixing parameterization of {cite.9.'Simmons_et_al_2004 Simmons et al. (2004)} now used in several climate models (e.g., {cite.9.'Jayne_2009}; {cite.9.'Danabasoglu_et_al_2012}). The transport of dense water down-slope by gravity currents (e.g., {cite.9.'Legg_et_al_2008}, 2009) has also been the subject of focussed efforts, with associated parameterizations making their way into some CMIP5 models ({cite.9.'Jackson_et_al_2008b}; {cite.9.'Legg_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Danabasoglu_et_al_2010}).
