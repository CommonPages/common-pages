title: 9.1.3.1.4 - Sea ice

Most large-scale sea ice processes, such as basic thermodynamics and dynamics, are well understood and well represented in models ({cite.9.'Hunke_et_al_2010}). However, important details of sea ice dynamics and deformation are not captured, especially at small scales ({cite.9.'Coon_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Girard_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Hutchings_et_al_2011}). Currently, sea ice model development is focussed mainly on (1) more precise descriptions of physical processes such as microstructure evolution and anisotropy and (2) including biological and chemical species. Many models now include some representation of sub-grid-scale thickness variations, along with a description of mechanical redistribution that converts thinner ice to thicker ice under deformation ({cite.9.'Hunke_et_al_2010}).

{Glossary.*Sea_ice Sea ice} {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} has long been recognized as a critical aspect of the global heat balance. The average ice surface albedo on the scale of a climate model grid cell is (as on land) the result of a mixture of surface types: bare ice, melting ice, snow-covered ice, open water, etc. Many sea ice models use a relatively simple albedo {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} that specifies four albedo values: cold snow; warm, melting snow; cold, bare ice; and warm, melting ice, and the specific values may be subject to tuning (e.g., {cite.9.'Losch_et_al_2010}). Some parameterizations take into account the ice and snow thickness, spectral band and surface melt (e.g., {cite.9.'Pedersen_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Vancoppenolle_et_al_2009}). {Glossary.*Solar_radiation Solar radiation} may be distributed within the ice column assuming exponential decay or via a more complex multiple-scattering radiative transfer scheme ({cite.9.'Briegleb_and_Light_2007}).

Snow model development for sea ice has lagged behind terrestrial snow models. {cite.9.'Lecomte_et_al_2011 Lecomte et al. (2011)} introduced vertically varying snow temperature, density and conductivity to improve vertical heat conduction and melting in a 1D model intended for climate simulation, but many physical processes affecting the evolution of the snow pack, such as redistribution by wind, moisture transport (including flooding and snow ice formation) and snow grain size evolution, still are not included in most {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.

Salinity affects the thermodynamic properties of sea ice, and is used in the calculation of fresh water and salt exchanges at the iceâ€“ocean interface ({cite.9.'Hunke_et_al_2011}). Some models allow the salinity to vary in time ({cite.9.'Schramm_et_al_1997}), while others assume a salinity profile that is constant (e.g., {cite.9.'Bitz_and_Lipscomb_1999}). Another new thrust is the inclusion of chemistry and biogeochemistry (Piot and von Glasow, 2008; {cite.9.'Zhao_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Vancoppenolle_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Hunke_et_al_2011}), with dependencies on the ice microstructure and salinity profile.

Melt ponds can drain through interconnected brine channels when the ice becomes warm and permeable. This flushing can effectively clean the ice of salt, nutrients, and other inclusions, which affect the albedo, conductivity and biogeochemical processes and thereby play a role in climate change. Advanced parameterizations for melt ponds are making their way into sea ice components of global climate models (e.g., {cite.9.'Flocco_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Hunke_et_al_2013}).
