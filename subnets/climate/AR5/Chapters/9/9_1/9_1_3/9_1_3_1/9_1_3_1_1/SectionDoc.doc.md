title: 9.1.3.1.1 - Atmosphere

Atmospheric models must parameterize a wide range of processes, including those associated with atmospheric {Glossary.*Convection convection} and clouds, cloud-microphysical and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} processes and their interaction, boundary layer processes, as well as radiation and the treatment of unresolved gravity waves. Advances made in the representation of cloud processes, including aerosol–cloud and cloud–radiation interactions, and atmospheric convection are described in Sections {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3 7.2.3} and {Chapters.7.7_4 7.4}.

Improvements in representing the {Glossary.*Atmospheric_boundary_layer atmospheric boundary layer} since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} have focussed on basic boundary layer processes, the representation of the stable boundary layer, and boundary layer clouds ({cite.9.'Teixeira_et_al_2008}). Several global models have successfully adopted new approaches to the {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of shallow cumulus convection and moist boundary layer turbulence that acknowledge their close mutual coupling. One new development is the Eddy-Diffusivity-Mass-Flux (EDMF) approach ({cite.9.'Siebesma_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Rio_and_Hourdin_2008}; {cite.9.'Neggers_2009}; {cite.9.'Neggers_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Rio_et_al_2010}). The EDMF approach, like the shallow cumulus scheme of {cite.9.'Park_and_Bretherton_2009 Park and Bretherton (2009)}, determines the cumulus-base mass flux from the statistical distribution of boundary layer updraft properties, a conceptual advance over the ad hoc closure assumptions used in the past. Realistic treatment of the stable boundary layer remains difficult ({cite.9.'Beare_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Cuxart_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Svensson_and_Holtslag_2009}) with implications for modelling of the diurnal cycle of temperature even under clear skies ({cite.9.'Svensson_et_al_2011}).

Parameterizations of unresolved orographic and non-orographic gravity-wave drag (GWD) have seen only a few changes since the AR4 (e.g., {cite.9.'Richter_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Geller_et_al_2011}). In addition to new formulations, the estimation of the parameters used in the GWD schemes has recently been advanced through the availability of satellite and groundbased observations of gravity-wave momentum fluxes, high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} numerical modelling, and focussed process studies ({cite.9.'Alexander_et_al_2010}). Evidence from the Numerical Weather Prediction community that important terrain-generated features of the atmospheric circulation are better represented at higher model resolution has recently been confirmed ({cite.9.'Watanabe_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Jung_et_al_2012}).
