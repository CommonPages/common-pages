title: 9.1.3.3 - Resolution

The typical horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} (defined here as horizontal grid spacing) for current {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} is roughly 1 to 2 degrees for the atmospheric component and around 1 degree for the ocean ({'Table_9_1 Table 9.1}). The typical number of vertical layers is around 30 to 40 for the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and around 30 to 60 for the ocean (note that some ‘high-top’ models may have 80 or more vertical levels in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}). There has been some modest increase in model resolution since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, especially for the near-term simulations (e.g., around 0.5 degree for the atmosphere in some cases), based on increased availability of more powerful computers. For the models used in long-term simulations with interactive biogeochemistry, the resolution has not increased substantially due to the trade-off against higher complexity in such models. Since the AR4, typical {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} model resolution has increased from around 50 km to around 25 km (see {Chapters.9.9_6.9_6_2.9_6_2_2 Section 9.6.2.2}), and the impact of this has been explored with multi-decadal regional simulations (e.g., {cite.9.'Christensen_et_al_2010}). In some cases, {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} are being run at 10 km resolution or higher (e.g., {cite.9.'Kanada_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Kusaka_et_al_2010}; van Roosmalen et al., 2010; {cite.9.'Kendon_et_al_2012}).

Higher resolution can sometimes lead to a stepwise, rather than incremental, improvement in model performance (e.g., {cite.9.'Roberts_et_al_2004}; {cite.9.'Shaffrey_et_al_2009}). For example, ocean models undergo a transition from laminar to eddy-permitting when the computational grid contains more than one or two grid points per first baroclinic Rossby radius (i.e., finer than 50 km at low latitudes and 10 km at high latitudes) ({cite.9.'Smith_et_al_2000}; {cite.9.'McWilliams_2008}). Such mesoscale eddy-permitting ocean models better capture the large amount of energy contained in fronts, boundary currents, and time dependent eddy features (e.g., {cite.9.'McClean_et_al_2006}). Models run at such resolution have been used for some climate simulations, though much work remains before they are as mature as the coarser models currently in use ({cite.9.'Bryan_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Bryan_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Farneti_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'McClean_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Delworth_et_al_2012}).

Similarly, atmospheric models with grids that allow the explicit representation of convective cloud systems (i.e., finer than a few kilometres) avoid employing a {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of their effects—a longstanding {Glossary.*Source source} of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. For example, {cite.9.'Kendon_et_al_2012 Kendon et al. (2012)} simulated the climate of the UK region over a 20-year period at 1.5 km resolution, and demonstrated several improvements of errors typical of coarser resolution models. Further discussion of this is provided in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2 Section 7.2.2}.
