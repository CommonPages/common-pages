title: 9.1.3.2.8 - Additional features in ocean–atmosphere coupling

Several features in the coupling between the ocean and the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} have become more widespread since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. The bulk formulae used to compute the turbulent fluxes of heat, water and momentum at the air–sea interface, have been revised. A number of models now consider the ocean surface current when calculating wind stress (e.g., {cite.9.'Luo_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Jungclaus_et_al_2006}). The coupling frequency has been increased in some cases to include the diurnal cycle, which was shown to reduce the {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} bias in the tropical Pacific ({cite.9.'Schmidt_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Bernie_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Ham_et_al_2010}). Several models now represent the coupling between the penetration of the {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} into the ocean and light-absorbing chlorophyll, with some implications on the representation of the mean climate and {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({cite.9.'Murtugudde_et_al_2002}; {cite.9.'Wetzel_et_al_2006}). This coupling is achieved either by prescribing the chlorophyll distribution from observations, or by computing the chlorophyll distribution with an ocean biogeochemical model (e.g., {cite.9.'Arora_et_al_2009}).
