section 9_1_3_2_2

  |The treatment of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} particles has advanced since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Many {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} now include the basic features of the sulphur cycle. Several AOGCMs and ESMs are currently capable of simulating the mass, number, size distribution and mixing state of interacting multi-component aerosol particles. However, despite the addition of aerosolâ€“cloud interactions to many AOGCMs and ESMs since the AR4, the representation of aerosol particles and their interaction with clouds remains an important {Glossary.*Source source} of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty}.
