title: 9.1.3.2.2 - Aerosol particles

The treatment of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} particles has advanced since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Many {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} now include the basic features of the sulphur cycle and so represent both the direct effect of sulphate aerosol, along with some of the more complex indirect effects involving cloud droplet number and size. Further, several AOGCMs and ESMs are currently capable of simulating the mass, number, size distribution and mixing state of interacting multi-component aerosol particles ({cite.9.'Bauer_et_al_2008b}; {cite.9.'Liu_et_al_2012b}). The incorporation of more physically complete representations of aerosol often improves the simulated climate under historical and present-day conditions, including the mean pattern and interannual variability in continental rainfall ({cite.9.'Rotstayn_et_al_2010}, 2011). However, despite the addition of aerosolâ€“cloud interactions to many AOGCMs and ESMs since the AR4, the representation of aerosol particles and their interaction with clouds and radiative transfer remains an important {Glossary.*Source source} of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} (see Sections {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_5 7.3.5} and {Chapters.7.7_4 7.4}). Additional aerosol-related topics that have received attention include the connection between dust aerosol and ocean biogeochemistry, the production of oceanic dimethylsulphide (DMS, a natural source of sulphate aerosol), and vegetation interactions with organic atmospheric chemistry ({cite.9.'Collins_et_al_2011}).
