title: 9.1.3.2.6 - Chemistry–climate interactions and stratosphere– troposphere coupling

Important chemistry–climate interactions such as the impact of the {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} hole and recovery on Southern Hemisphere (SH) climate or the radiative effects of stratospheric water vapour changes on {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} have been confirmed in multiple studies (SPARC-CCMVal, 2010; {cite.9.'WMO_2011}). In the majority of the CMIP5 simulations stratospheric ozone is prescribed. The main advance since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} is that time-varying rather than constant stratospheric ozone is now generally used. In addition, several CMIP5 models treat stratospheric chemistry interactively, thus prognostically calculating stratospheric ozone and other chemical constituents. Important chemistry–climate interactions such as an increased influx of stratospheric ozone in a warmer climate that results in higher ozone {Glossary.*Burden burdens} in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} have also been identified ({cite.9.'Young_et_al_2013}). Ten of the CMIP5 models simulate tropospheric chemistry interactively whereas it is prescribed in the remaining models (see {'Table_9_1 Table 9.1} and {cite.9.'Eyring_et_al_2013 Eyring et al. (2013)}).

It is now widely accepted that in addition to the influence of tropospheric circulation and climate change on the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}, stratospheric dynamics can in turn influence the tropospheric circulation and its variability (SPARC-CCMVal, 2010; {cite.9.'WMO_2011}). As a result, many {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} now have the ability to include a fully resolved stratosphere with a model top above the stratopause, located at around 50 km. The subset of CMIP5 models with high-top configurations is compared to the set of low-top models with a model top below the stratopause in several studies (Charlton-Perez et al., 2012; {cite.9.'Hardiman_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Wilcox_et_al_2012}), although other factors such as differences in tropospheric warming or ozone could affect the two sub-ensembles.
