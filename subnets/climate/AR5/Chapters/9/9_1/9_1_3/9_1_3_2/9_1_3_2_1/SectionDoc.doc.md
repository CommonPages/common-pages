title: 9.1.3.2.1 - Carbon cycle

The omission of internally consistent feedbacks among the physical, chemical and biogeochemical processes in the Earthâ€™s climate system is a limitation of {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}. The conceptual issue is that the physical climate influences natural sources and sinks of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and methane ({Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}), the two most important long-lived {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}. {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} incorporate many of the important biogeochemical processes, making it possible to simulate the evolution of these radiatively active species based on their {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from natural and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} sources together with their interactions with the rest of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system}. Alternatively, when forced with specified concentrations, a model can be used to diagnose these sources with feedbacks included ({cite.9.'Hibbard_et_al_2007}). Given the large natural sources and sinks of CO2 relative to anthropogenic emissions, and given the primacy of CO2 among anthropogenic GHGs, some of the most important enhancements are the addition of terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles. These cycles have been incorporated into many models ({cite.9.'Christian_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Tjiputra_et_al_2010}) used to make {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of climate change ({cite.9.'Schurgers_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Jungclaus_et_al_2010}). Several ESMs now include coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles ({cite.9.'Thornton_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Gerber_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}) in order to simulate the interactions of nitrogen compounds with {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} productivity, GHGs including nitrous oxide ({Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}) and {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} (O3), and global carbon {Glossary.*Sequestration sequestration} ({cite.9.'Zaehle_and_Dalmonech_2011}).

Oceanic {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of CO2 is highly variable in space and time, and is determined by the interplay between the biogeochemical and physical processes in the ocean. About half of CMIP5 models make use of schemes that partition marine ecosystems into nutrients, {Glossary.*Plankton plankton}, zooplankton and detritus (hence called NPZD-type models) while others use a more simplified representation of ocean biogeochemistry (see Table 9.A.1). These NPZD-type models allow simulation of some of the important feedbacks between climate and oceanic CO2 uptake, but are limited by the lack of marine ecosystem dynamics. Some efforts have been made to include more plankton groups or plankton functional types in the models (Le Quere et al., 2005) with as-yet uncertain implications for Earth system response.

{Glossary.*Ocean_acidification Ocean acidification} and the associated decrease in calcification in many marine organisms provides a negative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} on atmospheric CO2 increase ({cite.9.'Ridgwell_et_al_2007a}). New-generation models therefore include various parameterizations of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production as a function of the saturation state of seawater with respect to calcite ({cite.9.'Gehlen_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Ridgwell_et_al_2007a}; {cite.9.'Ilyina_et_al_2009}) or partial pressure CO2 (pCO2; {cite.9.'Heinze_2004}). On centennial to multi-millennial scales, deep-sea carbonate sediments neutralize atmospheric CO2. Some CMIP5 models include the sediment carbon {Glossary.*Reservoir reservoir}, and progress has been made toward refined sediment representation in the models ({cite.9.'Heinze_et_al_2009}).
