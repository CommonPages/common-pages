title: 9.1.3.2.4 - Dynamic global vegetation models and wildland fires

One of the potentially more significant effects of climate change is the alteration of the distribution, speciation and life cycle of vegetated ecosystems ({cite.9.'Bergengren_et_al_2001}, 2011). Vegetation has a significant influence on the surface {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance}, exchanges of non-{Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and the terrestrial carbon {Glossary.*Sink sink}. Systematic shifts in vegetation, for example, northward migration of boreal forests, would therefore impose biogeophysical feedbacks on the physical climate system ({cite.9.'Clark_et_al_2011}). In order to include these effects in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of climate change, several dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) have been developed and deployed in {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} ({cite.9.'Cramer_et_al_2001}; {cite.9.'Sitch_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Ostle_et_al_2009}). Although agriculture and managed forests are not yet generally incorporated, DGVMs can simulate the interactions among natural and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} drivers of global warming, the state of terrestrial ecosystems and ecological feedbacks on further climate change. The incorporation of DGVMs has required considerable improvement in the physics of coupled models to produce stable and realistic distributions of flora ({cite.9.'Oleson_et_al_2008b}). The improvements include better treatments of surface, subsurface and soil hydrological processes; the exchange of water with the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}; and the discharge of water into rivers and streams. Whereas the first DGVMs have been coupled primarily to the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, the current generation of DGVMs are being extended to include ecological sources and sinks of other non-CO2 trace gases including {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}, biogenic {Glossary.*Volatile_Organic_Compounds volatile organic compounds} (BVOCs) and nitrogen oxides collectively known as NOx ({cite.9.'Arneth_et_al_2010}). BVOCs and NOx can alter the {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of some GHGs and act as {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} for secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}. Disturbance of the natural landscape by fire has significant climatic effects through its impact on vegetation and through its {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of GHGs, aerosols and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} precursors. Because the frequency of wildland fires increases rapidly with increases in ambient temperature ({cite.9.'Westerling_et_al_2006}), the effects of fires are projected to grow over the 21st century ({cite.9.'Kloster_et_al_2012}). The interactions of fires with the rest of the climate system are now being introduced into ESMs ({cite.9.'Arora_and_Boer_2005}; {cite.9.'Pechony_and_Shindell_2009}; {cite.9.'Shevliakova_et_al_2009}).
