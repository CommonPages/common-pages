title: 9.1.3.2.7 - Land ice sheets

The rate of melt water release from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in response to climate change remains a major {Glossary.*Source source} of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise (see Sections {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3 13.4.3} and {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4 13.4.4}). Until recently, the long-term response of these ice sheets to alterations in the surrounding {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and ocean has been simulated using offline models. Several {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} currently have the capability to have {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} component models coupled to the rest of the climate system ({cite.9.'Driesschaert_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Charbit_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Vizcaino_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Huybrechts_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Robinson_et_al_2012}) although these capabilities are not exercised for CMIP5.
