title: 9.1.3.2.3 - Methane cycle and permafrost

In addition to {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, an increasing number of {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} are also incorporating components of the {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} cycle, for example, atmospheric CH4 chemistry and wetland {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, to quantify some of the feedbacks from changes in CH4 sources and sinks under a warming climate ({cite.9.'Stocker_et_al_2012}). Some models now simulate the evolution of the {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} carbon {Glossary.*Stock stock} ({cite.9.'Khvorostyanov_et_al_2008a}, 2008b), and in some cases this is integrated with the representation of terrestrial and oceanic CH4 cycles ({cite.9.'Volodin_2008b}; {cite.9.'Volodin_et_al_2010}).
