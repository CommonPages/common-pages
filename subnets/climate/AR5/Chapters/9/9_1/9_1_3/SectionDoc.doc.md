title: 9.1.3 - Model Improvements

The {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} assessed in this report have seen a number of improvements since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Model development is a complex and iterative task: improved physical process descriptions are developed, new model components are introduced and the {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of the models is improved. After assembly of all model components, model parameters are adjusted, or tuned, to provide a stable model climate. The overall approach to model development and tuning is summarized in {Box_9_1 Box 9.1}.
