title: 9.1.2.1 - Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models

{Topics.*Climate_System Atmosphere}–Ocean General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}) were the ‘standard’ {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} assessed in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Their primary function is to understand the dynamics of the physical components of the climate system ({Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, ocean, land and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}), and for making {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} based on future {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} (GHG) and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. These models continue to be extensively used, and in particular are run (sometimes at higher {Glossary.*Resolution resolution}) for seasonal to decadal climate {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} applications in which biogeochemical feedbacks are not critical (see {Chapters.11 Chapter 11}). In addition, high-resolution or variable-resolution AOGCMs are often used in process studies or applications with a focus on a particular {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}. An overview of the AOGCMs assessed in this chapter can be found in {'Table_9_1 Table 9.1} and the details in Table 9.A.1. For some specific applications, an atmospheric component of such a model is used on its own.
