title: 9.1.2.3 - Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity

{Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} attempt to include relevant components of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system}, but often in an idealized manner or at lower {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} than the models described above. These models are applied to certain scientific questions such as understanding climate feedbacks on millennial time scales or exploring sensitivities in which long model integrations or large ensembles are required ({cite.9.'Claussen_et_al_2002}; {cite.9.'Petoukhov_et_al_2005}). This class of models often includes Earth system components not yet included in all {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} (e.g., ice sheets). As computing power increases, this model class has continued to advance in terms of resolution and complexity. An overview of EMICs assessed in this chapter and in the AR5 WG1 is provided in {'Table_9_2 Table 9.2} with additional details in Table 9.A.2.

Significant advances in EMIC capabilities are inclusion of ice sheets (UVic 2.9, {cite.9.'Weaver_et_al_2001}; CLIMBER-2.4, {cite.9.'Petoukhov_et_al_2000}; LOVECLIM, {cite.9.'Goosse_et_al_2010}) and ocean sediment models (DCESS, {cite.9.'Shaffer_et_al_2008}; UVic 2.9, {cite.9.'Weaver_et_al_2001}; Bern3D-LPJ, {cite.9.'Ritz_et_al_2011}). These additional interactive components provide critical feedbacks involved in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise estimates and {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} response on millennial time scales ({cite.9.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}). Further, the flexibility and efficiency of EMICs allow calibration to specific climate change events to remove potential biases.
