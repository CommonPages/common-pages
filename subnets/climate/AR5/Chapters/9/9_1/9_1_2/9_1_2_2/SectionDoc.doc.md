title: 9.1.2.2 - Earth System Models

{Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} are the current state-of-the-art models, and they expand on {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} to include representation of various biogeochemical cycles such as those involved in the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, the sulphur cycle, or {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({cite.9.'Flato_2011}). These models provide the most comprehensive tools available for simulating past and future response of the climate system to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing}, in which biogeochemical feedbacks play an important role. An overview of the ESMs assessed in this chapter can be found in {'Table_9_1 Table 9.1} and details in Table 9.A.1.
