title: 9.1.2.4 - Regional Climate Models

{Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} are limited-area models with representations of climate processes comparable to those in the atmospheric and land surface components of {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}, though typically run without interactive ocean and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}. RCMs are often used to dynamically ‘downscale’ global model simulations for some particular geographical {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} to provide more detailed information ({cite.9.'Laprise_2008}; {cite.9.'Rummukainen_2010}). By contrast, empirical and statistical {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} methods constitute a range of techniques to provide similar regional or local detail.
