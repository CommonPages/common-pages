title: 9.1.2 - Overview of Model Types to Be Evaluated

The models used in climate research range from simple {Glossary.*Energy_Balance_Model energy balance models} to complex {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs}) requiring state of the art high-performance computing. The choice of model depends directly on the scientific question being addressed ({cite.9.'Held_2005}; Collins et al., 2006d). Applications include simulating palaeo or historical climate, sensitivity and process studies for {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} and physical understanding, predicting near-term {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} and change on seasonal to decadal time scales, making {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate} change over the coming century or more and {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} such projections to provide more detail at the regional and local scale. Computational cost is a factor in all of these, and so simplified models (with reduced complexity or spatial {Glossary.*Resolution resolution}) can be used when larger ensembles or longer integrations are required. Examples include exploration of parameter sensitivity or simulations of climate change on the millennial or longer time scale. Here, we provide a brief overview of the {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} evaluated in this chapter.
