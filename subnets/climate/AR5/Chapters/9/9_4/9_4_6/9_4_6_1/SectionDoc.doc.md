title: 9.4.6.1 - Recent Trends in Global Aerosol Burdens and Effects on Insolation

The ability of CMIP5 models to simulate the current burden of tropospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} and the decadal trends in this burden can be assessed using observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD, see {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_1.7_3_1_2 Section 7.3.1.2}). The historical data used to drive the CMIP5 20th century simulations reflect recent trends in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} SO2 {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, and hence these trends should be manifested in the modelled and observed AOD. During the last three decades, anthropogenic emissions of SO2 from North America and Europe have declined due to the imposition of emission controls, while the emissions from Asia have increased. The combination of the European, North American, and Asians trends has yielded a global reduction in SO emissions of 20 Gg(SO ), or 15% between 1970 and 2000 although emissions subsequently increased by 9 Gg(SO2) between 2000 and 2005 ({cite.9.'Smith_et_al_2011b}). For the period 2001 to 2005, CMIP5 models underestimate the mean AOD at 550 nm relative to satellite-retrieved AOD by at least 20% over virtually all land surfaces ({'Figure_9_28 Figure 9.28}). The differences between the modelled and measured AODs exceed the errors in the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) retrievals over land of ±0.05 or 0.2×AOD ({cite.9.'Kahn_et_al_2005}) and the RMS errors in the corrected Moderate {Glossary.*Resolution Resolution} Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) retrievals over ocean of 0.061 ({cite.9.'Shi_et_al_2011}).

The effects of sulphate and other aerosol species on surface {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} through direct and indirect {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} appear to be one of the principal causes of the ‘{Glossary.*Global_dimming global dimming}’ between the 1960s and 1980s and subsequent ‘global brightening’ in the last two decades (see {Chapters.2.2_3.2_3_3.2_3_3_1 Section 2.3.3.1}). This inference is supported by trends in aerosol optical depth and trends in surface insolation under cloud-free conditions. Thirteen out of 14 CMIP3 models examined by {cite.9.'Ruckstuhl_and_Norris_2009 Ruckstuhl and Norris (2009)} produce a transition from “dimming” to ‘brightening’ that is consistent with the timing of the transition from increasing to decreasing global anthropogenic aerosol emissions. The transition from ‘dimming’ to ‘brightening’ in both Europe and North America is well simulated with the HadGEM2 model ({cite.9.'Haywood_et_al_2011}).

These recent trends are superimposed on a general upward {Glossary.*Trend trend} in aerosol loading since 1850 reflected by an increase in global mean oceanic AODs from the CMIP5 historical and RCP 4.5 simulations from 1850 to 2010 ({'Figure_9_29 Figure 9.29}). Despite the use of common anthropogenic aerosol emissions for the historical simulations ({cite.9.'Lamarque_et_al_2010}), the simulated oceanic AODs for 2010 range from 0.08 to 0.215, with nearly equal numbers of models over and underestimating the satellite retrieved AOD of 0.12 ({'Figure_9_29 Figure 9.29}). This range in AODs results from differing estimates of the trends and of the initial global mean oceanic AOD at 1850 across the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} ({'Figure_9_29 Figure 9.29}).
