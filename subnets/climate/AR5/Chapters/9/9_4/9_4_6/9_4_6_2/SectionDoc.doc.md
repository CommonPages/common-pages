title: 9.4.6.2 - Principal Sources of Uncertainty in Projections of Sulphate Burdens

Natural sources of sulphate from oxidation of dimethylsulphide (DMS) {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from the ocean surface are not specified under the RCP protocol and therefore represent a {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in the sulphur cycle simulated by the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}. In simulations of present-day conditions, DMS emissions span a 5 to 95% confidence interval of 10.7 to 28.1 TgS yr–1 ({cite.9.'Faloona_2009}). After chemical processing, DMS contributes between 18 and 42% of the global atmospheric sulphate burden and up to 80% of the sulphate burden over most the SH ({cite.9.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}). Several CMIP5 models include prognostic calculation of the biogenic DMS source; however, the effects from differences in DMS emissions on modelled sulphate {Glossary.*Burden burdens} remain to be quantified.

In contrast to CMIP3, the models in the CMIP5 ensemble are provided with a single internally consistent set of future {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} SO2 emissions. The use of a single set of emissions removes an important, but not dominant, source of uncertainty in the AR5 simulations of the sulphur cycle. In experiments based on a single chemistry–{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} with perturbations to both emissions and sulphur-cycle processes, {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in emissions accounted for 53.3% of the ensemble variance ({cite.9.'Ackerley_et_al_2009}). The next largest source of uncertainty was associated with the wet scavenging of sulphate (see {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_2 Section 7.3.2}), which accounted for 29.5% of the intra-ensemble variance and represents the source/{Glossary.*Sink sink} term with the largest relative range in the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} models evaluated by {cite.9.'Faloona_2009 Faloona (2009)}. Similarly, simulations run with heterogeneous or harmonized emissions data sets yielded approximately the same intermodel standard deviation in sulphate burden of 25 Tg. These results show that a dominant source of the spread among the sulphate burdens is associated with differences in the treatment of chemical production, transport, and removal from the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.9.'Liu_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Textor_et_al_2007}). Errors in modelled aerosol burden systematically affect anthropogenic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} ({cite.9.'Shindell_et_al_2013b}).
