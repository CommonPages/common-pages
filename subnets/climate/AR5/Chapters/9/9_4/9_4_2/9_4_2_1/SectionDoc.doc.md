title: 9.4.2.1 - Simulation of Mean Temperature and Salinity Structure

Potential temperature and salinity are the main ocean state variables and their zonal distribution offers an evaluation of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} in different parts of the ocean (upper ocean, {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline}, deep ocean). Over most latitudes, at depths ranging from 200 m to 2000 m, the CMIP5 multi-model mean zonally averaged ocean temperature is too warm ({'Figure_9_13 Figure 9.13}a), albeit with a cooler deep ocean. Similar biases were evident in the CMIP3 multi-model mean. Above 200 m, however, the CMIP5 (and CMIP3) multi-model mean is too cold, with maximum cold bias (more than 1°C) near the surface at mid-latitudes of the NH and near 200 m at 15°S. Zonal salinity errors ({'Figure_9_13 Figure 9.13}b) exhibit a different pattern from those of the potential temperature indicating that most do not occur via density compensation. Some near surface structures in the tropics and in the northern mid-latitude are indicative of density compensation and are presumably due to surface fluxes errors. At intermediate depths, errors in {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} formation translate into errors in both salinity and potential temperature.

In the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} it was noted that the largest errors in {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} in CMIP3 were found in mid and high latitudes. While this is still the case in CMIP5, there is marginal improvement with fewer individual models exhibiting serious bias—the inter-model zonal mean SST error standard deviation is significantly reduced at all latitudes north of 40oS—even though the multi-model mean is only slightly improved ({'Figure_9_14 Figure 9.14}a, c). Near the equator, the cold tongue error in the Pacific (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_5.9_4_2_5_1 Section 9.4.2.5.1}) is reduced by 30% in CMIP5; the Atlantic still exhibits serious errors and the Indian is still well simulated ({'Figure_9_14 Figure 9.14}b,d). In the Tropics, {cite.9.'Li_and_Xie_2012 Li and Xie (2012)} have shown that SST errors could be classified into those exhibiting broad meridional structures that are due to cloud errors, and those associated with Pacific and Atlantic cold tongue errors that are due to thermocline depth errors.

Sea surface salinity (SSS) is more challenging to observe, even though the last decade has seen substantial improvements in the development of global salinity observations, such as those from the Array for Realtime Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) network (see {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}). Whereas SST is strongly constrained by air–sea interactions, the sources of SSS variations (surface {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} via evaporation minus precipitation, {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} formation/melt and river {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}) are only loosely related to the SSS itself, allowing errors to develop unchecked in coupled models. An analysis of CMIP3 models showed that, whereas the historical {Glossary.*Trend trend} in global mean SSS is well captured by the models, regional SSS biases are as high as ±2.5 psu ({cite.9.'Terray_et_al_2012}). Comparisons of modelled versus observed estimates of evaporation minus precipitation suggest that model biases in surface freshwater flux play a role in some regions (e.g., double Intertropical Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}) in the East Pacific; {cite.9.'Lin_2007}) or over the Indian ocean ({cite.9.'Pokhrel_et_al_2012}).

The performance of coupled climate models in simulating hydrographic structure and variability were assessed in two important regions, the Labrador and Irminger Seas and the Southern Ocean (de Jong et al., 2009) and ({cite.9.'Sloyan_and_Kamenkovich_2007}). Eight CMIP3 models produce simulations of the intermediate and deep layers in the Labrador and Irminger Seas that are generally too warm and saline, with biases up to 0.7 psu and 2.9°C. The biases arise because the convective regime is restricted to the upper 500 m; thus, intermediate water that in reality is formed by {Glossary.*Convection convection} is, in the models, partly replaced by warmer water from the south. In the Southern Ocean, Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), two water masses indicating very efficient ocean {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation}, are found to be well simulated in some CMIP3 and CMIP5 models but not in others, some having a significant fresh bias ({cite.9.'Sloyan_and_Kamenkovich_2007}; {cite.9.'Salle_et_al_2013}). {cite.9.'McClean_and_Carman_2011 McClean and Carman (2011)} found biases in the properties of the North Atlantic mode waters and their formation rates in the CMIP3 models. Errors in Subtropical Mode Water (STMW) formation rate and volume produce a {Glossary.*Turnover_time_T turnover time} of 1 to 2 years, approximately half of that observed. Bottom water properties assessment in CMIP5 shows that about half of the models create dense water on the Antarctic shelf, but it mixes with lighter water and is not exported as bottom water. Instead most models create deep water by open ocean deep convection, a process occurring rarely in reality (Heuzé et al., 2013) which leads to errors in deep water formation and properties in the Southern Ocean as shown in {'Figure_9_15 Figure 9.15}.

Few studies have assessed the performance of models in simulating Mixed Layer Depth (MLD). In the North East Pacific {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, {cite.9.'Jang_et_al_2011 Jang et al. (2011)} found that the CMIP3 models exhibit the observed deep MLD in the Kuroshio Extension, though with a deep bias and only one large deep MLD region, rather than the observed two localized maxima. Other studies have noted MLD biases near sea ice edges ({cite.9.'Capotondi_et_al_2012}).
