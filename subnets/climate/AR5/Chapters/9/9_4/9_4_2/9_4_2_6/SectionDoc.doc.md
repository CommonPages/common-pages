title: 9.4.2.6 - Summary

There is high confidence that the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate the main physical and dynamical processes at play during transient ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake}, {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise, and coupled {Topics.*Climate_Variability modes of variability}. There is little evidence that CMIP5 models differ significantly from CMIP3, although there is some evidence of modest improvement. Many improvements are seen in individual CMIP5 ocean components (some now including interactive ocean biogeochemistry) and the number of relatively poor-performing models has been reduced (thereby reducing inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread}). New since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, process-based model evaluation is now helping identify the cause of some specific biases, helping to overcome the limits set by the short observational records available.
