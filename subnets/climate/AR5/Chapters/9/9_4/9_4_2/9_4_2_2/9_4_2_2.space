title: 9.4.2.2 - Simulation of Sea Level and Ocean Heat Content
section 9_4_2_2

  |Ocean heat content (OHC) depends only on ocean temperature, whereas absolute changes in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} are also influenced by processes that are only now being incorporated into global models. There is high confidence that many CMIP5 models reproduce the observed increase in ocean heat content since 1960.
