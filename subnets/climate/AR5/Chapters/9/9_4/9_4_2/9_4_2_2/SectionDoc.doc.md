title: 9.4.2.2 - Simulation of Sea Level and Ocean Heat Content

{Glossary.*Steric Steric} and dynamic components of the mean dynamic topography (MDT) and sea surface height (SSH) patterns can be compared to observations ({cite.9.'Maximenko_et_al_2009}). Pattern correlations between simulated and observed MDT are above 0.95 for all of the CMIP5 models ({'Figure_9_16 Figure 9.16}), an improvement compared to CMIP3. MDT biases over tropical ocean regions are consistent with surface wind stress biases ({cite.9.'Lee_et_al_2013}). Over the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of eddy-induced transports is essential for the models’ density structure and thus MDT ({cite.9.'Kuhlbrodt_et_al_2012}). High-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} eddy resolving ocean models show improved SSH simulations over coarser resolution versions ({cite.9.'McClean_et_al_2006}). {Chapters.13 Chapter 13} provides a more extensive assessment of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} changes in CMIP5 simulations, including comparisons with century-scale historical records.

Ocean heat content (OHC) depends only on ocean temperature, whereas absolute changes in sea level are also influenced by processes that are only now being incorporated into global models (e.g., mass loss from large ice sheets discussed in {Chapters.9.9_1.9_1_3.9_1_3_2.9_1_3_2_7 Section 9.1.3.2.7}). However, global-scale changes in OHC are highly correlated with the {Glossary.*Thermosteric thermosteric} contribution to global SSH changes ({cite.9.'Domingues_et_al_2008}). Approximately half of the historical CMIP3 simulations did not include the effects of volcanic eruptions, resulting in substantially greater than observed ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} during the late 20th century ({cite.9.'Gleckler_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Domingues_et_al_2008}). {'Figure_9_17 Figure 9.17} shows observed and simulated global 0 to 700 m and total OHC changes during the overlap period of the observational record and the CMIP5 historical experiment (1961–2005). Three upper-ocean observational estimates, assessed in {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}, are also shown to indicate observational uncertainty. The CMIP5 multi-model mean falls within the range of observations for most of the period, and the intermodel spread is reduced relative to CMIP3 ({cite.9.'Gleckler_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Domingues_et_al_2008}). This may result from most CMIP5 models including volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}. When the deep ocean is included, the CMIP5 multi-model mean also agrees well with the observations, although the deeper ocean estimates are much more uncertain ({Chapters.3 Chapter 3}). There is high confidence that many CMIP5 models reproduce the observed increase in ocean heat content since 1960.

EMIC results for changes in total OHC are also compared with observations in {'Figure_9_17 Figure 9.17}. (Note: results in this figure are based on {cite.9.'Eby_et_al_2013 Eby et al. (2013)} who show OHC changes for 0 to 2000 m, whereas here the time-integrated net heat flux into the ocean surface is shown to compare with CMIP5 results ({'Figure_9_17 Figure 9.17}b)). There is a tendency for the {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} to overestimate total OHC changes and this could alter the temperature related feedbacks on the oceanic {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, and affect the long-term millennium {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}. However, it should be noted that high OHC changes can compensate for biases in {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} or RF so as to reproduce {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} changes over the 20th century. This will result in biased thermosteric sea level rise for millennial projections. Calibrated EMICs ({cite.9.'Meinshausen_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Sokolov_et_al_2010}) would remove such biases.

In idealized CMIP5 experiments ({Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increasing 1% yr–1), the heat uptake efficiency of the CMIP5 models varies by a factor of two, explaining about 50% of the {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} ({cite.9.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}). Despite observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, this recent work also provides limited evidence that in the upper 2000 m, most CMIP5 models are less stratified (in the global mean) than is observed, which suggests that these models transport heat downwards more efficiently than the real ocean. These results are consistent with earlier studies ({cite.9.'Forest_et_al_2006}, 2008; {cite.9.'Boe_et_al_2009a}; {cite.9.'Sokolov_et_al_2010}) that conclude the CMIP3 models may overestimate oceanic mixing efficiency and therefore underestimate the Transient Climate Response (TCR) and its impact on future surface warming. However, {cite.9.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012 Kuhlbrodt and Gregory (2012)} also find that this apparent bias explains very little of the model spread in TCR. Although some progress has been made in understanding mixing deficiencies in ocean models ({cite.9.'Griffies_and_Greatbatch_2012}; {cite.9.'Ilicak_et_al_2012}), this remains a key challenge in improving the representation of physical processes that impact the evolution of ocean heat content and {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion}.
