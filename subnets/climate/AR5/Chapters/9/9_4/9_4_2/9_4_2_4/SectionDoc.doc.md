title: 9.4.2.4 - Simulation of Surface Fluxes and Meridional Transports

Surface fluxes play a large part in determining the fidelity of ocean simulations. As noted in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in surface heat and fresh water flux observations (usually obtained indirectly) do not allow useful evaluation of models. This is still the case and so the focus here is on an integrated quantity, meridional heat transport, which is less prone to errors. Surface wind stress is better observed and models are evaluated against observed products below.

The zonal component of wind stress is particularly important in driving ocean surface currents; modelled and observed values are shown in {'Figure_9_19 Figure 9.19}. At middle to high latitudes, the model-simulated wind stress maximum lies 5 to 10 degree equatorward of that in the observationally based estimates, and so mid-latitude westerly winds are too strong in models. This equatorward shift in the southern ocean is slightly reduced in CMIP5 relative to CMIP3. At these latitudes, the largest near surface wind speed biases in CMIP5 are located over the Pacific sector and the smallest are in the Atlantic sector ({cite.9.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2013}). Such wind stress errors may adversely affect oceanic heat and carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} ({cite.9.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012a}). At middle to low latitudes, the CMIP3 and CMIP5 model spreads are smaller than at high latitudes, although near the equator this can occur through compensating errors ({'Figure_9_20 Figure 9.20}). The simulated multi-model mean equatorial zonal wind stress is too weak in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and too strong in the western Pacific, with no major improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5.

The CMIP5 model simulations qualitatively agree with the various observational estimates on the most important features of ocean heat transport ({'Figure_9_21 Figure 9.21}) and, in a multi-model sense, no major change from CMIP3 can be seen. All CMIP5 models are able to the represent the strong north-south asymmetry, with the largest values in the NH, consistent with the observational estimates. At most latitudes the majority of CMIP5 model results fall within the range of observational estimates, although there is some suggestion of modest underestimate between 15°N and 25°N and south of about 60°S. Some models show an equatorward transport at Southern-Hemisphere mid-latitudes that is also featured in the observation estimate of {cite.9.'Large_and_Yeager_2009 Large and Yeager (2009)}. This highlights the difficulties in representing large-scale energy processes in the Southern ocean as discussed by {cite.9.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010b Trenberth and Fasullo (2010b)}. Note that {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} should exhibit a vanishing net {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} when long time averages are considered but unphysical sources and sinks lead to energy biases ({cite.9.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2009}, 2010a; {cite.9.'Lucarini_and_Ragone_2011}) that are also found in {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} constrained by observations ({cite.9.'Trenberth_et_al_2009}). When correcting for the imperfect closure of the energy cycle, as done here, comparison between models and observational estimates become possible.
