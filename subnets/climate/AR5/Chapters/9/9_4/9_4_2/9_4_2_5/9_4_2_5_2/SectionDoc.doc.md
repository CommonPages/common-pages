title: 9.4.2.5.2 - Tropical Atlantic Ocean

CMIP3 and CMIP5 models exhibit severe biases in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, so severe that some of the most fundamental features—the east–west {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradient and the eastward shoaling {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} along the equator—cannot be reproduced ({'Figure_9_14 Figure 9.14}; ({cite.9.'Chang_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Chang_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Richter_and_Xie_2008}; {cite.9.'Richter_et_al_2013}). In many models, the warm SST bias along the Benguela coast is in excess of 5°C and the Atlantic warm pool in the western basin is grossly underestimated ({cite.9.'Liu_et_al_2013a}). As in the Pacific, CMIP3 models suffer the double {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} error in the Atlantic. Hypotheses for the complex Atlantic bias problem tend to draw on the fact that the Atlantic Ocean has a far smaller basin, and thus encourages a tighter and more complex land– {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean interaction. A recent study using a high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} coupled model suggests that the warm eastern equatorial Atlantic SST bias is more sensitive to the local rather than basin-wide trade wind bias and to a wet Congo basin instead of a dry Amazon—a finding that differs from previous studies ({cite.9.'Patricola_et_al_2012}). Recent ocean model studies show that a warm subsurface temperature bias in the eastern equatorial Atlantic is common to virtually all ocean models forced with ‘best estimated’ surface momentum and heat fluxes, owing to problems in {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of vertical mixing ({cite.9.'Hazeleger_and_Haarsma_2005}). {cite.9.'Toniazzo_and_Woolnough_2013 Toniazzo and Woolnough (2013)} show that among a variety of causes for the initial bias development, ocean–{Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} coupling is key for their maintenance.
