title: 9.4.2.5.1 - Tropical Pacific Ocean

Although the basic east–west structure of the tropical Pacific is well captured, models have shown persistent biases in important properties of the mean state ({cite.9.'AchutaRao_and_Sperber_2002}; {cite.9.'Randall_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_et_al_2009b}) with severe local impacts ({cite.9.'Brown_et_al_2012}). Among these biases are the mean {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} depth and slope along the equator, the structure of the equatorial current system, and the excessive equatorial cold tongue ({cite.9.'Reichler_and_Kim_2008}; {cite.9.'Brown_et_al_2010a}; {cite.9.'Zheng_et_al_2012}). Many reasons for these biases have been proposed, such as: too strong trade winds; a too diffusive thermocline; deficient horizontally isotropic mixing coefficients; insufficient penetration of {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}; and too weak tropical instability waves ({cite.9.'Meehl_et_al_2001}; {cite.9.'Wittenberg_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Lin_2007}). It is noteworthy that CMIP5 models exhibit some improvements in the western equatorial Pacific when compared to CMIP3, with reduced {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} and trade wind errors (Figures {'Figure_9_14 9.14} and {'Figure_9_20 9.20}). Because of strong interactions between the processes involved, it is difficult to identify the ultimate {Glossary.*Source source} of these errors, although new approaches using the {Glossary.*Rapid_adjustment rapid adjustment} of initialized simulations hold promise (Vannière et al., 2011).

A particular problem in simulating the seasonal cycle in the tropical Pacific arises from the ‘double {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}’, defined as the appearance of a spurious ITCZ in the SH associated with excessive tropical precipitation. Further problems are too strong a seasonal cycle in simulated SST and winds in the eastern Pacific and the appearance of a spurious semi-annual cycle. The latter has been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to meridional asymmetry in the background state that is too weak, possibly in conjunction with incorrect regional water vapour feedbacks ({cite.9.'Li_and_Philander_1996}; {cite.9.'Guilyardi_2006}; {cite.9.'Timmermann_et_al_2007}; De Szoeke and Xie, 2008; {cite.9.'Wu_et_al_2008a}; {cite.9.'Hirota_et_al_2011}).

A further persistent problem is insufficient marine stratocumulus cloud in the eastern tropical Pacific, caused presumably by weak coastal upwelling off South America leading to a warm SST bias ({cite.9.'Lin_2007}). Although the problem persists, improvements are being made ({cite.9.'AchutaRao_and_Sperber_2006}).
