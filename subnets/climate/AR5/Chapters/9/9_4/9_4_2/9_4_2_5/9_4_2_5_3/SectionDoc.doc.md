title: 9.4.2.5.3 - Tropical Indian Ocean

CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate equatorial Indian Ocean climate reasonably well (e.g., {'Figure_9_14 Figure 9.14}), though most models produce weak westerly winds and a flat {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} on the equator. The models show a large spread in the modelled depth of the 20Â°C isotherm in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean ({cite.9.'Saji_et_al_2006}). The reasons are unclear but may be related to differences in the various parameterizations of vertical mixing as well as the wind structure ({cite.9.'Schott_et_al_2009}).

CMIP3 models generally simulate the Seychelles Chagos thermocline ridge in the Southwest Indian Ocean, a feature important for the Indian {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} and tropical cyclone activity in this basin ({cite.9.'Xie_et_al_2002}). The models, however, have significant problems in accurately representing its seasonal cycle because of the difficulty in capturing the asymmetric nature of the monsoonal winds over the basin, resulting in too weak a semi-annual harmonic in the local {Glossary.*Ekman_pumping Ekman pumping} over the ridge {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} compared to observations ({cite.9.'Yokoi_et_al_2009b}). In about half of the models, the thermocline ridge is displaced eastward associated with the easterly wind biases on the equator ({cite.9.'Nagura_et_al_2013}).
