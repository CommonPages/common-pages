title: 9.4.2 - Ocean

Accurate simulation of the ocean in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} is essential for the correct estimation of transient ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} and transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}, ocean {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} uptake, {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise, and coupled {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate modes} such as {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}. In this section model performance is assessed for the mean state of ocean properties, surface fluxes and their impact on the simulation of ocean heat content and sea level, and aspects of importance for climate variability. Simulations of both the recent and more distant past are evaluated against available data. Following {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}, ocean reanalyses are not used for model evaluation as many of their properties depend on the model used to build the {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis}.
