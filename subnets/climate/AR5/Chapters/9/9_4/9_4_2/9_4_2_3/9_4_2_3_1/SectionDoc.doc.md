Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation Meridional Overturning Circulation}

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) consists of northward transport of shallow warm water overlying a southward transport of deep cold water and is responsible for a considerable part of the northward oceanic heat transport. Long-term AMOC estimates have had to be inferred from hydrographic measurements sporadically available over the last decades (e.g., {cite.9.'Bryden_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Lumpkin_et_al_2008}, {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}.6.3). Continuous AMOC monitoring at 26.5°N was started in 2004 ({cite.9.'Cunningham_et_al_2007}) and now provides a 5-year mean value of 18.5 Sv with annual means having a standard deviation of 1 Sv ({cite.9.'McCarthy_et_al_2012}). The ability of models to simulate this important circulation feature is tied to the credibility of simulated AMOC weakening during the 21st century because the magnitude of the weakening is correlated with the initial AMOC strength ({cite.9.'Gregory_et_al_2005}). The mean AMOC strength in CMIP5 models ranges from 15 to 30 Sv for the historical period which is comparable to the CMIP3 models ({cite.9.'Weaver_et_al_2012}; see {'Figure_12_35 Figure 12.35}). The variability of the AMOC is assessed in {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_3.9_5_3_3_1 Section 9.5.3.3.1}.

Southern Ocean circulation

The Southern Ocean is an important driver for the meridional overturning circulation and is closely linked to the zonally continuous Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). {cite.9.'Gupta_et_al_2009 Gupta et al. (2009)} noted that relatively small deficiencies in the position of the ACC lead to more obvious biases in the {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} in the models. The ability of CMIP3 models to adequately represent Southern Ocean circulation and water masses seems to be affected by several factors ({cite.9.'Russell_et_al_2006}). The most important are the strength of the westerlies at the latitude of the Drake Passage, the heat flux gradient over this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, and the change in salinity with depth across the ACC. {cite.9.'Kuhlbrodt_et_al_2012 Kuhlbrodt et al. (2012)} found that the strongest influence on ACC transport in the CMIP3 models was the Gent-McWilliams thickness diffusivity. The ACC has a typical transport through the Drake Passage of about 135 Sv (e.g., {cite.9.'Cunningham_et_al_2003}). A comparison of CMIP5 models ({cite.9.'Meijers_et_al_2012}) shows that, firstly, the ACC transport through Drake Passage is improved as compared to the CMIP3 models, and secondly, that the inter-model Present range in the zonal mean ACC position is smaller than in the CMIP3 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} (in CMIP5, the mean transport is 148 Sv and the standard deviation is 50 Sv across an ensemble of 21 models).

Simulation of glacial ocean conditions

Reconstructions of the last glacial maximum from sediment cores discussed in {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} indicate that the regions of deep water formation in the North Atlantic were shifted southward, that the boundary between North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) was substantially shallower than today, and that NADW formation was less intense ({cite.9.'Duplessy_et_al_1988}; {cite.9.'Dokken_and_Jansen_1999}; {cite.9.'McManus_et_al_2004}; {cite.9.'Curry_and_Oppo_2005}). This signal, although estimated from a limited number of sites, is robust (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}). The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} reported that model simulations showed a wide range of AMOC response to {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.9.'Weber_et_al_2007}), with some models exhibiting reduced strength of the AMOC and its extension at depth and other showing no change or an increase. {'Figure_9_18 Figure 9.18} provides an update of the diagnosis proposed by Otto-Bliesner et al. (2007) to compare model results with the deep ocean data from {cite.9.'Adkins_et_al_2002 Adkins et al. (2002)} using PMIP2 and CMIP5/PMIP3 pre-industrial and LGM simulations ({cite.9.'Braconnot_et_al_2012}). These models reproduce the modern deep ocean temperature–salinity (T–S) structure in the Atlantic basin, but most of them do not capture the cold and salty bottom water suggested by the LGM reconstructions, providing evidence that processes responsible for such palaeoclimate changes may not be well reproduced in contemporary {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. This is expected to also affect {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} changes in deep ocean properties.
