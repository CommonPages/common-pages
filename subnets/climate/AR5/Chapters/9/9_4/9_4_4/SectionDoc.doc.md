title: 9.4.4 - Land Surface, Fluxes and Hydrology

The land surface determines the partitioning of precipitation into {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration} and {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, and the partitioning of surface net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes. Land surface processes therefore impact strongly on both the climate and hydrological resources. This subsection summarizes recent studies on the evaluation of land surface models, wherever possible emphasizing their performance in CMIP3 and CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.
