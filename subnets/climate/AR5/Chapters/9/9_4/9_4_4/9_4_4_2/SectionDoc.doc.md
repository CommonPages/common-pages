title: 9.4.4.2 - Soil Moisture and Surface Hydrology

The partitioning of precipitation into {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration} and {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} is highly dependent on the moisture status of the land surface, especially the amount of {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} available for evapotranspiration, which in turn depends on properties of the land cover such as the rooting depth of plants.

There has been a long history of off-line evaluation of land surface schemes, aided more recently by the increasing availability of site-specific data ({cite.9.'Friend_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Blyth_et_al_2010}). Throughout this time, representations of the land surface have significantly increased in complexity, allowing the representation of key processes such as links between stomatal conductance and {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis}, but at the cost of increasing the number of poorly known internal model parameters. These more sophisticated land surface models are based on physical principles that should make them more appropriate for {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate} and increased {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}. However for specific data-rich sites, current land surface models still struggle to perform as well as statistical models in predicting year-to-year variations in latent and sensible heat fluxes ({cite.9.'Abramowitz_et_al_2008}) and runoff ({cite.9.'Materia_et_al_2010}).

There are few evaluations of the performance of land surface schemes in coupled {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, but those that have been undertaken find major limitations associated with the atmospheric {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} rather than the land surface schemes themselves. For example, an evaluation of the soil moisture simulations of CMIP3 models found that long-term soil moisture trends could only be reproduced in models that simulated the reduction in {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} at the surface associated with ‘{Glossary.*Global_dimming global dimming}’ ({cite.9.'Li_et_al_2007}). A comparison of simulated evapotranspiration fluxes from CMIP3 against large-scale observation-based estimates, showed underestimates in India and parts of eastern South America, and overestimates in the western USA, Australia and China ({cite.9.'Mueller_et_al_2011}).

Land–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} coupling determines the ability of climate models to simulate the influence of soil moisture anomalies on rainfall, droughts and high-{Topics.*Extreme_Events temperature extremes} ({cite.9.'Fischer_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Lorenz_et_al_2012}). The coupling strength depends both on the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to soil moisture, which is determined by the land surface scheme, and the sensitivity of precipitation to evapotranspiration, which is determined by the atmospheric model ({cite.9.'Koster_et_al_2004}; {cite.9.'Seneviratne_et_al_2010}). Comparison of climate model simulations to observations suggests that the models correctly represent the soil-moisture impacts on temperature extremes in southeastern Europe, but overestimate them in central Europe ({cite.9.'Hirschi_et_al_2011}). The influence of soil moisture on rainfall varies significantly with {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, and with the lead-time between a soil moisture anomaly and a rainfall event ({cite.9.'Seneviratne_et_al_2010}). In some regions, such as the Sahel, enhanced precipitation can even be induced by dry anomalies ({cite.9.'Taylor_et_al_2011}). Recent analyses of CMIP5 models reveals considerable spread in the ability of the models to reproduce observed correlations between precipitation and soil moisture in the tropics ({cite.9.'Williams_et_al_2012}), and a systematic failure to simulate the positive impact of dry soil moisture anomalies on rainfall in the Sahel ({cite.9.'Taylor_et_al_2012a}).
