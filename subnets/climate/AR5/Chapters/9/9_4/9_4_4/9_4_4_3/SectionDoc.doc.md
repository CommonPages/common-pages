title: 9.4.4.3 - Dynamic Global Vegetation and Nitrogen Cycling

At the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} very few {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} included dynamic vegetation, with vegetation being prescribed and fixed in all but a handful of coupled climate–{Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} models ({cite.9.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006}). Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) certainly existed at the time of the AR4 ({cite.9.'Cramer_et_al_2001}) but these were not typically incorporated in climate models. Since the AR4 there has been continual development of offline DGVMs, and some climate models incorporate dynamic vegetation in at least a subset of the runs submitted to CMIP5 (also see {Chapters.9.9_1.9_1_3.9_1_3_2.9_1_3_2_4 Section 9.1.3.2.4}), with likely consequences for climate model biases and {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projection} ({cite.9.'Martin_and_Levine_2012}).

DGVMs are designed to simulate the large-scale geographical distribution of plant functional types and how these patterns will change in response to climate change, {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increases, and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} factors ({cite.9.'Cramer_et_al_2001}). These models typically include rather detailed representations of plant {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} but less sophisticated treatments of soil carbon, with a varying number of soil carbon pools. In the absence of nitrogen limitations on CO2 fertilization, offline DGVMs agree qualitatively that CO2 increase alone will tend to enhance carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} on the land while the associated climate change will tend to reduce it. There is also good agreement on the degree of CO2 fertilization in the case of no nutrient limitation ({cite.9.'Sitch_et_al_2008}). However, under more extreme {Topics.*Scenarios emissions scenarios} the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. Large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are associated with the responses of tropical and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} status. Particular areas of uncertainty are the high-temperature response of photosynthesis ({cite.9.'Galbraith_et_al_2010}), and the extent of CO2 fertilization ({cite.9.'Rammig_et_al_2010}) in the Amazonian rainforest.

Most of the land surface models and DGVMs used in the CMIP5 models continue to neglect nutrient limitations on plant growth (see {Chapters.6.6_4.6_4_6.6_4_6_2 Section 6.4.6.2}), even though these may significantly moderate the response of photosynthesis to CO2 ({cite.9.'Wang_and_Houlton_2009}). Recent extensions of two land surface models to include nitrogen limitations improve the fit to ‘Free-Air CO2 Enrichment Experiments’, and suggest that models without these limitations are expected to overestimate the land carbon {Glossary.*Sink sink} in the nitrogen-limited mid and high latitudes ({cite.9.'Thornton_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Zaehle_et_al_2010}).
