title: 9.4.4.4 - Land Use Change

A major innovation in the land component of {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} is the inclusion of the effects of land use change associated with the spread of agriculture, urbanization and {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation}. These affect climate by altering the biophysical properties of the land surface, such as its {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}, aerodynamic roughness and water-holding capacity ({cite.9.'Bondeau_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Bonan_2008}; {cite.9.'Bathiany_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Levis_2010}). {Topics.*Land_Use_Change Land use change} has also contributed almost 30% of total {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} since 1850 (see {'Table_6_1 Table 6.1}), and affects emissions of trace gases, and VOCs such as isoprene. The latest ESMs used in CMIP5 attempt to model the CO2 emissions implied by prescribed land use change and many also simulate the associated changes in the biophysical properties of the land surface. This represents a major advance on the CMIP3 models which typically neglected land use change, aside from its assumed contribution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

However, the increasing sophistication of the modelling of the impacts of land use change has introduced additional spread in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. The first systematic {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison model intercomparison} demonstrated that large-scale land cover change can significantly affect {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} ({cite.9.'Pitman_et_al_2009}) and showed a large spread in the response of different models to the same imposed land cover change (de Noblet-Ducoudre et al., 2012). This {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} arises from the often counteracting effects of {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration} and albedo changes ({cite.9.'Boisier_et_al_2012}) and has consequences for the simulation of temperature and rainfall extremes ({cite.9.'Pitman_et_al_2012b}).
