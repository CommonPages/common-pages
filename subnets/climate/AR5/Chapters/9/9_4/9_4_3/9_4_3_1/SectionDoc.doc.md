title: 9.4.3.1 - Summary

CMIP5 models reproduce the seasonal cycle of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} extent in both hemispheres. There is robust evidence that the downward {Glossary.*Trend trend} in Arctic summer sea ice extent is better simulated than at the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, with about one quarter of the simulations showing a trend as strong as, or stronger than, that observed over the satellite era. The performance improvements are not only a result of improvements in sea ice components themselves but also in atmospheric circulation. Most CMIP5 models simulate a decrease in Antarctic sea ice extent over the past few decades compared to the small but significant increase observed.
