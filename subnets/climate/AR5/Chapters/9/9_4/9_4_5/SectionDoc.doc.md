title: 9.4.5 - Carbon Cycle

An important development since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} is the more widespread implementation of {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} that include an interactive carbon cycle. Coupled climate-carbon cycle models are used extensively for the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} presented in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}. The evaluation of the carbon cycle within coupled models is discussed here, while the performance of the individual land and ocean carbon models, together with the detailed analysis of climate–carbon cycle feedbacks, is presented in {Chapters.6 Chapter 6} ({Chapters.6.6_4 Section 6.4} and {Box_6_4 Box 6.4}).

The transition from {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} to ESMs was motivated in part by the results from the first generation coupled climate–carbon cycle models, which suggested that feedbacks between the climate and the carbon cycle were uncertain but potentially very important in the context of 21st century climate change ({cite.9.'Cox_et_al_2000}; {cite.9.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2001}). The first-generation models used in the Coupled Climate {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle Carbon Cycle} {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project (C4MIP) included both extended AOGCMS and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs}. The C4MIP experimental design involved running each model under a common {Glossary.*Emission_scenario emission scenario} (SRES A2) and calculating the evolution of the global atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration interactively within the model. The impacts of climate–carbon cycle feedbacks were diagnosed by carrying out parallel “uncoupled” simulations in which increases in atmospheric CO2 did not influence climate. Analysis of the C4MIP runs highlighted a greater than 200 ppmv range in the CO2 concentration by 2100 due to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in climate–carbon cycle feedbacks, and that the largest uncertainties were associated with the response of land ecosystems to climate and CO2 ({cite.9.'Friedlingstein_et_al_2006}).

For CMIP5 a different experimental design was proposed in which the core simulations use prescribed {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} of atmospheric CO2 and other {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} ({cite.9.'Moss_et_al_2010}). Under a prescribed CO2 scenario, ESMs calculate land and ocean carbon fluxes interactively, but these fluxes do not affect the evolution of atmospheric CO2. Instead the modelled land and ocean fluxes, along with the prescribed increase in atmospheric CO2, can be used to diagnose the ‘compatible’ {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of CO2 consistent with the simulation (see {Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}; {cite.9.'Miyama_and_Kawamiya_2009}; {cite.9.'Arora_et_al_2011}). The {Glossary.*Compatible_emissions compatible emissions} for each model can then be evaluated against the best estimates of the actual historical CO2 emissions. Parallel {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} in which the carbon cycle does not respond to the simulated climate change (which are equivalent to the ‘uncoupled’ simulations in C4MIP) provide a means to diagnose climate–carbon cycle feedbacks in terms of their impact on the compatible emissions of CO2 ({cite.9.'Hibbard_et_al_2007}).

Carbon cycle model evaluation is limited by the availability of direct observations at appropriately large spatial scales. Field studies and eddy-covariance flux measurements provide detailed information on the land carbon cycle over short-time scales and for specific locations, and ocean inventories are able to constrain the long-term {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 by the ocean ({cite.9.'Sabine_et_al_2004}; {cite.9.'Takahashi_et_al_2009}). However the stores of carbon on the land are less well-known, even though these are important determinants of the CO2 fluxes from {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}. ESM simulations vary by a factor of at least six in global soil carbon ({cite.9.'Anav_et_al_2013}; Todd-{cite.9.'Brown_et_al_2013}) and by a factor of four in global vegetation carbon, although about two thirds of models are within 50% of the uncertain observational estimates ({cite.9.'Anav_et_al_2013}).

Large-scale land–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and global {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} fluxes are not directly measured, but global estimates can be made from the carbon balance, and large-scale regional fluxes can be estimated from the inversion of atmospheric CO2 measurements (see {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_2 Section 6.3.2}). {'Figure_9_26 Figure 9.26} shows modelled annual mean ocean–atmosphere and net land– atmosphere CO2 fluxes from the historical simulations in the CMIP5 archive ({cite.9.'Anav_et_al_2013}). Also shown are estimates derived from offline ocean carbon cycle models, measurements of atmospheric CO2, and best estimates of the CO2 fluxes from fossil fuels and land use change (Le Quere et al., 2009). Uncertainties in these latter annual estimates are approximately ±0.5 PgC yr–1, arising predominantly from the uncertainty in the model-derived ocean CO2 uptake. The confidence limits for the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean are derived by assuming that the CMIP5 models form a t-distribution centred on the ensemble mean ({cite.9.'Anav_et_al_2013}).

The evolution of the global ocean carbon {Glossary.*Sink sink} is shown in the top panel of {'Figure_9_26 Figure 9.26}. The CMIP5 ensemble mean global ocean uptake (± standard deviation of the multi-model ensemble), computed using all the 23 models that reported ocean CO2 fluxes, increases from 0.47 ± 0.32 PgC yr–1 over the period 1901–1930 to 1.53 ± 0.36 PgC yr–1 for the period 1960–2005. For comparison, the Global Carbon Project (GCP) estimates a stronger ocean carbon sink of 1.92 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1 for 1960–2005 ({cite.9.'Anav_et_al_2013}). The bottom panel of {'Figure_9_26 Figure 9.26} shows the variability in global land carbon uptake evident in the GCP estimates, with the global land carbon sink being strongest during {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña} years and after volcanoes, and turning into a {Glossary.*Source source} during El Niño years. The CMIP5 models cannot be expected to precisely reproduce this year-to-year variability as these models will naturally simulate {Glossary.*Chaotic chaotic} {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} variability that is out of phase with the historical variability. However, the ensemble mean does successfully simulate a strengthening global land carbon sink during the 1990s, especially after the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991. The CMIP5 ensemble mean land–atmosphere flux (± standard deviation of the multi-model ensemble) evolves from a small source of –0.34 ± 0.49 PgC yr–1 over the period 1901– 1930, predominantly due to land use change, to a sink of 0.47 ± 0.72 PgC yr–1 in the period 1960–2005. The GCP estimates give a weaker sink of 0.36 ± 1 PgC yr–1 for the 1960–2005 period.

{'Figure_9_27 Figure 9.27} shows the ocean–atmosphere fluxes (top panel) and mean land–atmosphere fluxes (bottom panel) simulated by ESMs and EMICs ({cite.9.'Eby_et_al_2013}) for the period 1986–2005, and compares these to observation-based estimates from GCP and Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model Intercomparison Project (TRANSCOM3) atmospheric inversions ({cite.9.'Gurney_et_al_2003}). Unlike {'Figure_9_26 Figure 9.26}, only models that reported both land and ocean carbon fluxes are included in this figure. The atmospheric inversions results are taken from the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) as this was the only TRANSCOM3 model that reported results for all years of the 1986–2005 reference period. The error bars on the observational estimates (red triangles) and the ESM simulations (black diamonds) represent the interannual variation in the form of the standard deviation of the annual fluxes. EMICs do not typically simulate interannual variability, so only mean values are shown for these models (green boxes). Here, as in {'Figure_9_26 Figure 9.26}, the net land–atmosphere flux is ‘Net {Glossary.*Biome Biome} Productivity (NBP)’ which includes the net CO2 emissions from land use change as well as the changing carbon balance of undisturbed ecosystems.

For the period 1986–2005 the observation-based estimates of the global ocean carbon sink are 1.71 PgC yr–1 (JMA), 2.19 PgC yr–1 (GCP) and 2.33 PgC yr–1 ({cite.9.'Takahashi_et_al_2009}). Taking into account the uncertainties in the mean values of these fluxes associated with interannual variability, the observationally constrained range is approximately 1.4 to 2.4 PgC yr–1. All of the ESMs, and all but one of the EMICs, simulate ocean sinks within this range. The observation-based estimates of GCP and JMA agree well on the mean global land carbon sink over the period 1986–2005, and most ESMs fit within the uncertainty bounds of these estimates (i.e., 1.17 ± 1.06 PgC yr–1 for JMA). The exceptions are two ESMs sharing common atmosphere and land components (CESM1-BGC and NorESM1-ME) which model a net land carbon source rather than a sink over this period. The EMICs tend to systematically underestimate the contemporary land carbon sink ({cite.9.'Eby_et_al_2013}). Some ESMs (notably GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL-ESM2G) significantly overestimate the interannual variation in the global land– atmosphere CO2 flux, with a possible consequence being an overestimate of the vulnerability of tropical ecosystems to future climate change ({cite.9.'Cox_et_al_2013}), and see {'Figure_9_45 Figure 9.45}). All ESMs qualitatively simulate the expected pattern of ocean CO2 fluxes, with outgassing in the tropics and uptake in the mid and high latitudes ({cite.9.'Anav_et_al_2013}). However, there are systematic differences between the ESMs and the JMA inversion estimates for the zonal land CO2 fluxes, with the ESMs tending to produce weaker uptake in the NH, and simulating a net land carbon sink rather than a source in the tropics.

In summary, there is high confidence that CMIP5 ESMs can simulate the global mean land and ocean carbon sinks within the range of observation-based estimates. Overall, EMICs reproduce the recent global ocean CO2 fluxes uptake as well as ESMs, but estimate a lower land carbon sink compared with most ESMs while remaining consistent with the observations ({cite.9.'Eby_et_al_2013}). With few exceptions, the CMIP5 ESMs also reproduce the large-scale pattern of ocean–atmosphere CO2 fluxes, with uptake in the Southern Ocean and northern mid-latitudes, and outgassing in the tropics. However, the geographical pattern of simulated land–atmosphere fluxes agrees much less well with inversion estimates, which suggest a larger sink in the northern mid-latitudes, and a net source rather than a sink in the tropics. While there are also inherent uncertainties in atmospheric inversions, discrepancies like this might be expected from known deficiencies in the CMIP5 generation of ESMs—namely the failure to correctly simulate nitrogen fertilization in the mid-latitudes, and a rudimentary treatment of the net CO2 emissions arising from land use change and {Glossary.*Forest forest} regrowth.
