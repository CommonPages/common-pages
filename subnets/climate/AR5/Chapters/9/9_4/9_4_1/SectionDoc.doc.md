title: 9.4.1 - Atmosphere

Many aspects of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} have been more extensively evaluated than other {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} components. One reason is the availability of near-global observationally based data for energy fluxes at the TOA, cloud cover and cloud condensate, temperature, winds, moisture, {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and other important properties. As discussed in {Box_2_3 Box 2.3}, atmospheric reanalyses have also enabled integrating independent observations in a physically consistent manner. In this section we use this diversity of data (see {'Table_9_3 Table 9.3}) to evaluate the large-scale atmospheric behaviour.
