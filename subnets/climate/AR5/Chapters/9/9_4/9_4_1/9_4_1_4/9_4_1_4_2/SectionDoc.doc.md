title: 9.4.1.4.2 - Tropical tropospheric temperature trends

Most {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} simulations show a larger warming in the tropical {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} than is found in observational data sets (e.g., {cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}). There has been an extensive and sometimes controversial debate in the published literature as to whether this difference is statistically significant, once observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and natural variability are taken into account (e.g., {cite.9.'Douglass_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2008}, 2013; {cite.9.'Christy_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Bengtsson_and_Hodges_2011}; {cite.9.'Fu_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Thorne_et_al_2011}). For the period 1979–2012, the various observational data sets find, in the tropical lower troposphere (LT), a linear warming {Glossary.*Trend trend} ranging from 0.06°C to 0.13°C per decade ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}, {'Figure_2_27 Figure 2.27}). In the tropical middle troposphere (MT), the linear warming trend ranges from 0.02°C to 0.12°C per decade ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}, {'Figure_2_27 Figure 2.27}). Uncertainty in these trend values arises from different methodological choices made by the groups deriving satellite products ({cite.9.'Mears_et_al_2011}) and radiosonde compilations ({cite.9.'Thorne_et_al_2011}), and from fitting a linear trend to a time series containing substantial interannual and decadal variability ({Box_2_2 Box 2.2}; {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}; ({cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010})). Although there have been substantial methodological debates about the calculation of trends and their uncertainty, a 95% confidence interval of around ±0.1°C per decade has been obtained consistently for both LT and MT (e.g., {Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}; {cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}). In summary, despite unanimous agreement on the sign of the observed trends, there exists substantial disagreement between available estimates as to the rate of temperature changes in the tropical troposphere, and there is only low confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}).

For the 30-year period 1979–2009 (sometimes updated through 2010 or 2011), the CMIP3 models simulate a tropical warming trend ranging from 0.1°C to somewhat above 0.4°C per decade for both LT and MT ({cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}), while the CMIP5 models simulate a tropical warming trend ranging from slightly below 0.15°C to somewhat above 0.4°C per decade for both LT and MT ({cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}; see also {cite.9.'PoChedley_and_Fu_2012}, who considered the period 1979–2005). Both model ensembles show trends that on average are higher than in the observational estimates, although both model ensembles overlap the observational {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}. Because the differences between the various observational estimates are largely systematic and structural ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}; {cite.9.'Mears_et_al_2011}), the uncertainty in the observed trends cannot be reduced by averaging the observations as if the differences between the data sets were purely random. Likewise, to properly represent internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, the full model ensemble spread must be used in a comparison against the observations (e.g., {Box_9_2 Box 9.2}; {Chapters.11.11_2.11_2_3.11_2_3_2 Section 11.2.3.2}; {cite.9.'Raftery_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Wilks_2006}; {cite.9.'Jolliffe_and_Stephenson_2011}). The very high significance levels of model–observation discrepancies in LT and MT trends that were obtained in some studies (e.g., {cite.9.'Douglass_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}) thus arose to a substantial degree from using the standard error of the model ensemble mean as a measure of uncertainty, instead of the ensemble standard deviation or some other appropriate measure for uncertainty arising from internal climate variability (e.g., {Box_9_2 Box 9.2}; {Chapters.11.11_2.11_2_3.11_2_3_2 Section 11.2.3.2}; {cite.9.'Raftery_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Wilks_2006}; {cite.9.'Jolliffe_and_Stephenson_2011}). Nevertheless, almost all model ensemble members show a warming trend in both LT and MT larger than observational estimates ({cite.9.'McKitrick_et_al_2010}; Po-Chedley and Fu, 2012; {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}).

The CMIP3 models show a 1979–2010 tropical {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} trend of 0.19°C per decade in the multi-model mean, significantly larger than the various observational trend estimates ranging from 0.10°C to 0.14°C per decade (including the 95% confidence interval; {cite.9.'Fu_et_al_2011}). As a consequence, simulated tropospheric temperature trends are also too large because models attempt to maintain static stability. By contrast, atmospheric models that are forced with the observed SST are in better agreement with observations, as was found in the CMIP3 model ECHAM5 ({cite.9.'Bengtsson_and_Hodges_2011}) and the CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}-only runs. In the latter, the LT trend range for the period 1981– 2008 is 0.13 to 0.19oC per decade—less than in the CMIP5 coupled models, but still an overestimate (Po-Chedley and Fu, 2012). The influence of SST trend errors on the analysis can be reduced by considering trends in tropospheric static stability, measured by the amplification of MT trends against LT trends; another approach is to consider the amplification of tropospheric trends against SST trends. The results of such analyses strongly depend on the time scale considered. Monthto-month variations are consistent between observations and models concerning amplification aloft against SST variations ({cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2005}) and concerning amplification of MT against LT variations ({cite.9.'PoChedley_and_Fu_2012}). By contrast, the 30-year trend in tropical static stability has been found to be larger than in the satellite observations for almost all ensemble members in both CMIP3 ({cite.9.'Fu_et_al_2011}) and CMIP5 (Po-Chedley and Fu, 2012). However, if the radiosonde compilations are used for the comparison, the trends in static stability in the CMIP3 models agree much better with the observations, and inconsistency cannot be diagnosed unambiguously ({cite.9.'Seidel_et_al_2012}) . What caused the remaining trend overestimate in static stability is not clear but has been argued recently to result from an upward propagation of bias in the model climatology (O’Gorman and Singh, 2013).

In summary, most, though not all, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models overestimate the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere during the satellite period 1979–2012. Roughly one-half to two-thirds of this difference from the observed trend is due to an overestimate of the SST trend, which is propagated upward because models attempt to maintain static stability. There is low confidence in these assessments, however, due to the low confidence in observed tropical tropospheric trend rates and vertical structure ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}).
