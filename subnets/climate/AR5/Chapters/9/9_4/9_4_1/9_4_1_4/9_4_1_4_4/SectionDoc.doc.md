title: 9.4.1.4.4 - Tropical circulation

Earlier assessments of a weakening Walker circulation ({cite.9.'Vecchi_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.9.'DiNezio_et_al_2009}) from models and reanalyses ({cite.9.'Yu_and_Zwiers_2010}) have been tempered by subsequent evidence that tropical Pacific Trade winds may have strengthened since the early 1990s (e.g., {cite.9.'Merrifield_and_Maltrud_2011}). Models suggest that the width of the Hadley cell should increase ({cite.9.'Frierson_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Lu_et_al_2007}), and there are indications that this has been observed over the past 25 years ({cite.9.'Seidel_et_al_2008}) but at an apparent rate (2 to 5 degrees of latitude since 1979) that is faster than in the CMIP3 models ({cite.9.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}).

The tendency in a warming climate for wet areas to receive more precipitation and subtropical dry areas to receive less, often termed the ‘rich-get richer’ mechanism ({cite.9.'Chou_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Held_and_Soden_2006}) is simulated in CMIP3 models ({cite.9.'Chou_and_Tu_2008}), and observational support for this is found from ocean salinity observations ({cite.9.'Durack_et_al_2012}) and precipitation gauge data over land ({cite.9.'Zhang_et_al_2007}). There is medium confidence that models are correct in simulating precipitation increases in wet areas and decreases in dry areas on broad spatial scales in a warming climate based on agreement among models and some evidence that this has been detected in observed trends (see {Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_1 Section 2.5.1}).

Several recent studies have examined the co-variability of tropical climate variables as a further means of evaluating {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. Specifically, there are observed relationships between lower tropospheric temperature and total column {Glossary.*Precipitable_water precipitable water} ({cite.9.'Mears_et_al_2007}), and between {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} and {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} ({cite.9.'Willett_et_al_2010}). {'Figure_9_9 Figure 9.9} (updated from {cite.9.'Mears_et_al_2007}) shows the relationship between 25-year (1988–2012) linear trends in tropical precipitable water and lower tropospheric temperature for individual historical simulations (extended by appending {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} simulations after 2005, see {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}). As described by {cite.9.'Mears_et_al_2007 Mears et al. (2007)}, the ratio between changes in these two quantities is fairly tightly constrained in the model simulations and similar across a range of time scales, indicating that relative humidity is close to invariant in each model. In the updated figure, the Remote Sensing System (RSS) observations are in fairly good agreement with model expectations, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) observations less so. The points associated with two of the reanalyses are also relatively far from the line, consistent with long-term changes in relative humidity. It is not known whether these discrepancies are due to remaining inhomogeneity in the observational data and/or {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} results, or due to problems with the climate simulations. All of the observational and reanalysis points lie at the lower end of the model distribution, consistent with the findings of ({cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}).
