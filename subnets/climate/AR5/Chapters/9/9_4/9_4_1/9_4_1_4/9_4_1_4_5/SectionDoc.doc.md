title: 9.4.1.4.5 - Ozone and lower stratospheric temperature trends

Stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} has been subject to a major perturbation since the late 1970s due to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of ozone-depleting substances (see also {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_2.2_2_2_2 Section 2.2.2.2} and {'Figure_2_6 Figure 2.6}). Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, there is increasing evidence that the {Glossary.*Ozone_hole ozone hole} has led to a poleward shift and strengthening of the SH mid-latitude tropospheric jet during summer ({cite.9.'Perlwitz_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Son_et_al_2008}, 2010; SPARC-CCMVal, 2010; {cite.9.'McLandress_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Polvani_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'WMO_2011}; {cite.9.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012b}). These trends are well captured in both chemistry–{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} (CCMs) with interactive stratospheric chemistry and in CMIP3 models with prescribed time-varying ozone ({cite.9.'Son_et_al_2010}; SPARC-CCMVal, 2010). However, around half of the CMIP3 models prescribe ozone as a fixed climatological value, and so these models are not able to simulate trends in surface climate attributable to changing stratospheric ozone amount ({cite.9.'Karpechko_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Son_et_al_2008}, 2010; {cite.9.'Fogt_et_al_2009}). For CMIP5, a new time-varying ozone data set ({cite.9.'Cionni_et_al_2011}) was developed and prescribed in the majority of models without interactive chemistry. This zonal mean data set is based on observations by {cite.9.'Randel_and_Wu_2007 Randel and Wu (2007)} and CCM {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} in the future (SPARC-CCMVal, 2010). Further, nine of the CMIP5 models include interactive chemistry and so compute their own ozone evolution. As a result, all CMIP5 models consider stratospheric ozone depletion and capture associated effects on SH surface climate, a significant advance over CMIP3. {'Figure_9_10 Figure 9.10} shows the global annual mean and Antarctic October mean of total column ozone in the CMIP5 models. The simulated trends in total column ozone are in medium agreement with observations, noting that some models that calculate ozone interactively show significant deviations from observation ({cite.9.'Eyring_et_al_2013}). The multi-model mean agrees well with observations, and there is robust evidence that this constitutes a significant improvement over CMIP3, where around half of the models did not include stratospheric ozone trends. Correspondingly, there is high confidence that the representation of associated effects on high-latitude surface climate and lower stratospheric cooling trends has improved compared to CMIP3.

Lower stratospheric temperature change is affected by ozone, and since 1958 the change is characterized by a long-term global cooling {Glossary.*Trend trend} interrupted by three 2-year warming episodes following large volcanic eruptions ({'Figure_2_24 Figure 2.24}). During the satellite era (since 1979) the cooling occurred mainly in two step-like transitions in the aftermath of the El Chichón eruption in 1982 and the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991, with each cooling transition followed by a period of relatively steady temperatures ({cite.9.'Randel_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Seidel_et_al_2011}). This specific evolution of global lower {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} temperatures since 1979 is well captured in the CMIP5 models when forced with both natural and anthropogenic climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, although the models tend to underestimate the long-term cooling trend (Charlton-Perez et al., 2012; {cite.9.'Eyring_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}) (see {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}).

Tropospheric ozone is an important GHG and as such needs to be well represented in climate simulations. In the historical period it has increased due to increases in ozone precursor emissions from anthropogenic activities (see Chapters {Chapters.2} and {Chapters.8}). Since the AR4, a new emission data set has been developed ({cite.9.'Lamarque_et_al_2010}), which has led to some differences in tropospheric ozone burden compared to previous studies, mainly due to {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning emissions ({cite.9.'Lamarque_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Cionni_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Young_et_al_2013}). Climatological mean tropospheric ozone in the CMIP5 simulations generally agrees well with satellite observations and ozonesondes, although as in the stratosphere, biases exist for individual models ({cite.9.'Eyring_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Young_et_al_2013}) (see also {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}).
