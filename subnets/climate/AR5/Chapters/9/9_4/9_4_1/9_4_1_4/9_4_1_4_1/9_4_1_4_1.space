title: 9.4.1.4.1 - Global surface temperature
section 9_4_1_4_1

  |{'Figure_9_8 Figure 9.8} compares the observational record of 20th century changes in global {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} to that simulated by each CMIP5 and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMIC} model. The gradual warming evident in the observational record, particularly in the more recent decades, is also evident in the simulations, with the multi-model mean tracking the observed value closely over most of the century, and individual model results departing by less than about 0.5Â°C.
