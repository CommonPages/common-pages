title: 9.4.1.4.3 - Extratropical circulation

The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that models, when forced with observed SSTs, are capable of producing the spatial distribution of {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks}, but generally show deficiencies in the numbers and depth of cyclones and the exact locations of the storm tracks. The ability to represent extratropical cyclones in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} has been improving, partly due to increases in horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution}.

Storm track biases over the North Atlantic have decreased in CMIP5 models compared to CMIP3 ({cite.9.'Zappa_et_al_2013}) although models still produce too zonal a storm track in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} and most models underestimate cyclone intensity ({cite.9.'Colle_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Zappa_et_al_2013}). {cite.9.'Chang_et_al_2012 Chang et al. (2012)} also find the storm tracks in the CMIP5 models to be too weak and too equatorwards in their position, similar to the CMIP3 models. The performance of the CMIP5 models in representing North Atlantic cyclones was found to be strongly dependent on model resolution ({cite.9.'Colle_et_al_2013}). Studies based on individual models typically find that models capture the general characteristics of storm tracks and extratropical cyclones ({cite.9.'Ulbrich_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Catto_et_al_2010}) and their associated fronts ({cite.9.'Catto_et_al_2013}) and show improvements over earlier model versions ({cite.9.'Loptien_et_al_2008}). However, some models have deficiencies in capturing the location of storm tracks ({cite.9.'Greeves_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Catto_et_al_2011}), in part owing to problems related to the location of warm waters such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current ({cite.9.'Greeves_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Keeley_et_al_2012}). This is an important issue because future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of storm tracks are sensitive to changes in SSTs ({cite.9.'Catto_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Laine_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'McDonald_2011}; {cite.9.'Woollings_et_al_2012}). Some studies find that storm track and cyclone biases are strongly related to atmospheric processes and parameterizations ({cite.9.'Bauer_et_al_2008a}; {cite.9.'Boer_and_Lambert_2008}; {cite.9.'Zappa_et_al_2013}). Representation of the Mediterranean storm track has been shown to be particularly dependent on model resolution ({cite.9.'Pinto_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Raible_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Bengtsson_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}), as is the representation of storm intensity and associated extremes in this area ({cite.9.'Champion_et_al_2011}). Most studies have focussed on NH storm tracks. However, recently two CMIP3 models were found to differ significantly in their simulation of extratropical cyclones affecting Australia ({cite.9.'Dowdy_et_al_2013}) and only about a third of the CMIP3 models were able to capture the observed changes and trends in Southern Hemisphere (SH) baroclinicity responsible for a reduction in the growth rate of the leading winter storm track modes ({cite.9.'Frederiksen_et_al_2011}). There is still a lack of information on SH storm track evaluation for the CMIP5 models.
