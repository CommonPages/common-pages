title: 9.4.1.4 - Long-Term Global-Scale Changes

The comparison of observed and simulated climate change is complicated by the fact that the simulation results depend on both model formulation and the time-varying {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} imposed on the models ({cite.9.'Allen_et_al_2000}; {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2007}). De-convolving the importance of model and forcing differences in the historical simulations is an important topic that is addressed in {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}; however, in this section a direct comparison is made to illustrate the ability of models to reproduce past changes.
