title: 9.4.1.5 - Model Simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Mid-Holocene

Simulations of {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} can be used to test a model’s response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} larger than those of the 20th century (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}), and the CMIP5 protocol includes palaeoclimate simulations referred to as PMIP3 ({Glossary.*Paleoclimate Paleoclimate} {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project, version 3) ({cite.9.'Taylor_et_al_2012b}). Specifically, the Last Glacial Maximum ({Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}, 21000 years BP) allows testing of the modelled {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} to the presence of a large {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} in the NH and to lower concentrations of radiatively active trace gases, whereas the mid-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} (MH, 6000 years BP) tests the response to changes in seasonality of {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} in the NH (see {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}). For these periods, palaeoclimate reconstructions allow quantitative model assessment ({cite.9.'Braconnot_et_al_2012}).

In addition the CMIP5/PMIP3 simulations can compared to previous palaeoclimate intercomparisons ({cite.9.'Joussaume_and_Taylor_1995}; Braconnot et al., 2007c).

{'Figure_9_11 Figure 9.11} compares model results to palaeoclimate reconstructions for both LGM (left) and MH (right). For most models the simulated LGM cooling is within the range of the climate reconstructions (Braconnot et al., 2007c; {cite.9.'Izumi_et_al_2013}), however {cite.9.'Hargreaves_et_al_2011 Hargreaves et al. (2011)} find a global mean model warm bias over the ocean of about 1°C for this period ({cite.9.'Hargreaves_et_al_2011}). LGM simulations tend to overestimate tropical cooling and underestimate mid-latitude cooling ({cite.9.'Kageyama_et_al_2006}; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2009). They thus underestimate polar amplification which is a feature also found for the mid-Holocene (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2006; {cite.9.'Zhang_et_al_2010a}) and other climatic contexts (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010). Part of this can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the representation of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} and vegetation feedbacks that have been shown to amplify the response at the LGM and the MH in these latitudes ({cite.9.'Braconnot_et_al_2007b}; {cite.9.'Otto_et_al_2009}; O’ishi and Abe-Ouchi, 2011). Biases in the representation of the coupling between vegetation and {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} are also responsible for excessive continental drying at the LGM ({cite.9.'Wohlfahrt_et_al_2008}) and uncertainties in vegetation {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} in {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} regions ({cite.9.'Wang_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Dallmeyer_et_al_2010}). Nevertheless, the ratio between the simulated change in temperature over land and over the ocean ({'Figure_9_11 Figure 9.11}c) is rather similar in different models, resulting mainly from simulation of the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} over land and ocean ({cite.9.'Sutton_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Laine_et_al_2009}). At a regional scale, models tend to underestimate the changes in the north-south temperature gradient over Europe both at the LGM ({cite.9.'Ramstein_et_al_2007}) and at the mid-Holocene ({cite.9.'Brewer_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Davis_and_Brewer_2009}).

The large-scale pattern of precipitation change during the MH ({'Figure_9_11 Figure 9.11}d) is reproduced, but models tend to underestimate the magnitude of precipitation change in most regions. In the SH (not shown in the figure), the simulated change in atmospheric circulation is consistent with precipitation records in Patagonia and New Zealand, even though the differences between model results are large and the reconstructions have large uncertainties ({cite.9.'Rojas_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Rojas_and_Moreno_2011}).

A wider range of model performance metrics is provided in {'Figure_9_12 Figure 9.12} ({cite.9.'Guiot_et_al_1999}; {cite.9.'Brewer_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2011}; {cite.9.'Izumi_et_al_2013}). Results for the MH are less reliable than for the LGM, because the forcing is weaker and involves smaller scale responses over the continent ({cite.9.'Hargreaves_et_al_2013}). As is the case for the simulations of present day climate, there is only modest improvement between the results of the more recent models (CMIP5/PMIP3) and those of earlier model versions (PMIP2) despite higher {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} and sophistication.
