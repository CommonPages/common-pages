title: 9.4.1.2 - Atmospheric Moisture, Clouds and Radiation

The global annual mean {Glossary.*Precipitable_water precipitable water} is a measure of the total moisture content of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. For the CMIP3 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}, the values of precipitable water agreed with one another and with multiple estimates from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/ National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and ECMWF ERA40 meteorological reanalyses to within approximately 10% ({cite.9.'Waliser_et_al_2007}). Initial analysis of the CMIP5 ensemble shows the model results are within the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} of the observations ({cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a}).

Modelling the vertical structure of water vapour is subject to greater uncertainty since the humidity profile is governed by a variety of processes. The CMIP3 models exhibited a significant dry bias of up to 25% in the boundary layer and a significant moist bias in the free {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} of up to 100% ({cite.9.'John_and_Soden_2007}). Upper tropospheric water vapour varied by a factor of three across the multi-model ensemble ({cite.9.'Su_et_al_2006}). Many models have large biases in lower stratospheric water vapour ({cite.9.'Gettelman_et_al_2010}), which could have implications for {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} change ({cite.9.'Solomon_et_al_2010}). The limited number of studies available for the CMIP5 model ensemble broadly confirms the results from the earlier model generation. In tropical regions, the models are too dry in the lower troposphere and too moist in the upper troposphere, whereas in the extratropics they are too moist throughout the troposphere ({cite.9.'Tian_et_al_2013}). However, many of the model values lie within the observational uncertainties.

{cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a Jiang et al. (2012a)} show that the largest biases occur in the upper troposphere, with model values up to twice that observed, while in the middle and lower troposphere models simulate water vapour to within 10% of the observations.

The spatial patterns and seasonal cycle of the radiative fluxes at the TOA are fundamental {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} quantities. Both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 model ensembles reproduce these patterns with considerable fidelity relative to the National Aeronautics and Space Adminsitration (NASA) Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) data sets ({cite.9.'Pincus_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Wang_and_Su_2013}). Globally averaged TOA shortwave and longwave components of the radiative fluxes in 12 {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}-only versions of the CMIP5 models were within 2.5 W m–2 of the observed values ({cite.9.'Wang_and_Su_2013}).

Comparisons against surface components of radiative fluxes show that, on average, the CMIP5 models overestimate the global mean downward all-sky shortwave flux at the surface by 2 ± 6 W m–2 (1 ± 3%) and underestimate the global downward longwave flux by 6 ± 9 W m–2 (2 ± 2%) ({cite.9.'Stephens_et_al_2012}). Although in tropical regions between 1 and 3 W m–2 of the bias may be due to systematic omission of precipitating and/or convective core ice hydrometeors ({cite.9.'Waliser_et_al_2011}), the correlation between the biases in the all-sky and clear-sky downwelling fluxes suggests that systematic errors in clear-sky radiative transfer calculations may be a primary cause for these biases. This is consistent with an analysis of the global annual mean estimates of clear-sky atmospheric absorption from the CMIP3 ensemble and the systematic underestimation of clear-sky solar absorption by radiative transfer codes ({cite.9.'Oreopoulos_et_al_2012}). The underestimation of absorption can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the omission or underestimation of absorbing aerosols, in particular carbonaceous species ({cite.9.'Kim_and_Ramanathan_2008}), or to the omission of weak-line ({cite.9.'Collins_et_al_2006b}) or continuum ({cite.9.'Ptashnik_et_al_2011}) absorption by water vapour ({cite.9.'Wild_et_al_2006}).

One of the major influences on radiative fluxes in the atmosphere is the presence of clouds and their radiative properties. To measure the influence of clouds on model deficiencies in the TOA {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget}, {'Figure_9_5 Figure 9.5} shows maps of deviations from observations in annual mean shortwave (top left), longwave (middle left) and net (bottom left) cloud {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} (CRE) for the CMIP5 multi-model mean. The figure (right panels) also shows zonal averages of the same quantities from two sets of observations, the individual CMIP5 models, and the multi-model average. The definition of CRE and observed mean fields for these quantities can be found in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7} ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_1.7_2_1_2 Section 7.2.1.2}, {'Figure_7_7 Figure 7.7}).

Models show large regional biases in CRE in the shortwave component, and these are particularly pronounced in the subtropics with too weak an effect (positive error) of model clouds on {Glossary.*Shortwave_radiation shortwave radiation} in the stratocumulus regions and too strong an effect (negative error) in the trade cumulus regions. This error has been shown to largely result from an overestimation of cloud reflectance, rather than cloud cover ({cite.9.'Nam_et_al_2012}). A too weak cloud influence on shortwave radiation is evident over the subpolar oceans of both hemispheres and the Northern Hemisphere (NH) land areas. It is evident in the zonal mean graphs that there is a wide range in both longwave and shortwave CRE between individual models. As is also evident, a significant reduction in the difference between models and observations has resulted from changes in the observational estimates of CRE, in particular at polar and subpolar as well as subtropical latitudes ({cite.9.'Loeb_et_al_2009}).

Understanding the biases in CRE in models requires a more in-depth analysis of the biases in cloud properties, including the fractional coverage of clouds, their vertical distribution as well as their liquid water and ice content. Major progress in this area has resulted from both the availability of new observational data sets and improved diagnostic techniques, including the increased use of instrument simulators (e.g., {cite.9.'Cesana_and_Chepfer_2012}; {cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a}). Many models have particular difficulties simulating upper tropospheric clouds ({cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a}), and low and mid-level cloud occurrence are frequently underestimated ({cite.9.'Cesana_and_Chepfer_2012}; {cite.9.'Nam_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Tsushima_et_al_2013}). Global mean values of both simulated ice and liquid water path vary by factors of 2 to 10 between models ({cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a}; {cite.9.'Li_et_al_2012a}). The global mean fraction of clouds that can be detected with confidence from satellites (optical thickness >1.3, {cite.9.'Pincus_et_al_2012 Pincus et al. (2012)}) is underestimated by 5 to 10 % ({cite.9.'Klein_et_al_2013}). Some of the above errors in clouds compensate to provide the global mean balance in radiation required by model tuning ({cite.9.'Tsushima_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Wang_and_Su_2013}; {Box_9_1 Box 9.1}).

In-depth analysis of several global and regional models ({cite.9.'Karlsson_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Teixeira_et_al_2011}) has shown that the interaction of boundary layer and cloud processes with the larger scale circulation systems that ultimately drive the observed subtropical cloud distribution remains poorly simulated. Large errors in subtropical clouds have been shown to negatively affect {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} patterns in coupled model simulations ({cite.9.'Hu_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Wahl_et_al_2011}). Several studies have highlighted the potential importance and poor simulation of subpolar clouds in the Arctic and Southern Oceans ({cite.9.'Karlsson_and_Svensson_2010}; {cite.9.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010b}; {cite.9.'Haynes_et_al_2011}; Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2012). A particular challenge for models is the simulation of the correct phase of the cloud condensate, although very few observations are available to evaluate models particularly with respect to their representation of cloud ice ({cite.9.'Waliser_et_al_2009b}; {cite.9.'Li_et_al_2012a}). Regime-oriented approaches to the evaluation of model clouds (see {Chapters.9.9_2.9_2_1 Section 9.2.1}) have identified that compensating errors in the CRE are largely a result of misrepresentations of the frequency of occurrence of key observed cloud regimes, while the radiative properties of the individual regimes contribute less to the overall model deficiencies ({cite.9.'Tsushima_et_al_2013}).

Several studies have identified progress in the simulation of clouds in the CMIP5 models compared to their CMIP3 counterparts. Particular examples include the improved simulation of vertically integrated ice water path ({cite.9.'Jiang_et_al_2012a}; {cite.9.'Li_et_al_2012a}) as well as a reduction of overabundant optically thick clouds in the mid-latitudes ({cite.9.'Klein_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Tsushima_et_al_2013}).

In summary, despite modest improvements there remain significant errors in the model simulation of clouds. There is very high confidence that these errors contribute significantly to the uncertainties in estimates of cloud feedbacks (see {Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_2.9_7_2_3 Section 9.7.2.3}; {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5 Section 7.2.5}, {'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10}) and hence the spread in climate change {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} reported in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}.
