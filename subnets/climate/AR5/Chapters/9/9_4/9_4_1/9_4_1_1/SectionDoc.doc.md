title: 9.4.1.1 - Temperature and Precipitation Spatial Patterns of the Mean State

{Glossary.*Surface_temperature Surface temperature} is perhaps the most routinely examined quantity in atmospheric models. Many processes must be adequately represented in order for a model to realistically capture the observed temperature distribution. The dominant external influence is incoming {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}, but many aspects of the simulated climate play an important role in modulating regional temperature such as the presence of clouds and the complex interactions between the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and the underlying land, ocean, snow, ice and {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere}.

The annual mean surface air temperature (at 2 m) is shown in {'Figure_9_2 Figure 9.2}(a) for the mean of all available CMIP5 models, and the error, relative to an observationally constrained {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} (ECMWF reanalysis of the global {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and surface conditions (ERA)-Interim; {cite.9.'Dee_et_al_2011}) is shown in {'Figure_9_2 Figure 9.2}(b). In most areas the multi-model mean agrees with the reanalysis to within 2°C, but there are several locations where the biases are much larger, particularly at high elevations over the Himalayas and parts of both Greenland and Antarctica, near the ice edge in the North Atlantic, and over ocean upwelling regions off the west coasts of South America and Africa. Averaging the absolute error of the individual CMIP5 models ({'Figure_9_2 Figure 9.2}c) yields similar magnitude as the multi-model mean bias ({'Figure_9_2 Figure 9.2}b), implying that compensating errors across models is limited. The inconsistency across the three available global reanalyses ({'Figure_9_2 Figure 9.2}d) that have assimilated temperature data at two metres ({cite.9.'Onogi_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Simmons_et_al_2010}) provides an indication of observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty}. Although the reanalysis inconsistency is smaller than the mean absolute bias in almost all regions, areas where inconsistency is largest (typically where observations are sparse) tend to be the same regions where the CMIP5 models show largest mean absolute error.

Seasonal performance of models can be evaluated by examining the difference between means for December–January–February (DJF) and June–July–August (JJA). {'Figure_9_3 Figures 9.3}(a) and (b) show the CMIP5 mean model seasonal cycle amplitude in surface air temperature (as measured by the difference between the DJF and JJA and the absolute value of this difference). The seasonal cycle amplitude is much larger over land where the thermal inertia is much smaller than over the oceans, and it is generally larger at higher latitudes as a result of the larger seasonal amplitude in {Glossary.*Insolation insolation}. {'Figure_9_3 Figures 9.3}(c) and (d) show the mean model bias of the seasonal cycle relative to the ERA-Interim reanalysis ({cite.9.'Dee_et_al_2011}). The largest biases correspond to areas of large seasonal amplitude, notably high latitudes over land, but relatively large biases are also evident in some lower latitude regions such as over northern India. Over most land areas the amplitude of the modelled seasonal cycle is larger than observed, whereas over much of the extratropical oceans the modelled amplitude is too small.

The simulation of precipitation is a more stringent test for models as it depends heavily on processes that must be parameterized. Challenges are compounded by the link to surface fields (topography, coastline, vegetation) that lead to much greater spatial heterogeneity at regional scales. {'Figure_9_4 Figure 9.4} shows the mean precipitation rate simulated by the CMIP5 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}, along with measures of error relative to precipitation analyses from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project ({cite.9.'Adler_et_al_2003}). The magnitude of observational uncertainty for precipitation varies with {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, which is why many studies make use of several estimates of precipitation. Known large-scale features are reproduced by the multi-model mean, such as a maximum precipitation just north of the equator in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, dry areas over the eastern subtropical ocean basins, and the minimum rainfall in Northern Africa ({cite.9.'Dai_2006}). While many large-scale features of the tropical circulation are reasonably well simulated, there are persistent biases. These include too low precipitation along the equator in the Western Pacific associated with ocean–atmosphere feedbacks maintaining the equatorial cold tongue ({cite.9.'Collins_et_al_2010}) and excessive precipitation in tropical convergence zones south of the equator in the Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific ({cite.9.'Lin_2007}; {cite.9.'Pincus_et_al_2008}). Other errors occurring in several models include an overly zonal orientation of the South-Pacific Convergence Zone ({cite.9.'Brown_et_al_2013}) as well as an overestimate of the frequency of occurrence of light rain events ({cite.9.'Stephens_et_al_2010}). Regional-scale precipitation simulation has strong parameter dependence ({cite.9.'Rougier_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Chen_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Neelin_et_al_2010}), and in some models substantial improvements have been shown through increases in {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ({cite.9.'Delworth_et_al_2012}) and improved representations of sub-gridscale processes, particularly {Glossary.*Convection convection} ({cite.9.'Neale_et_al_2008}). Judged by similarity with the spatial pattern of observations, the overall quality of the simulation of the mean state of precipitation in the CMIP5 ensemble is slightly better than in the CMIP3 ensemble (see {FAQ_9_1 FAQ 9.1} and {'Figure_9_6 Figure 9.6}).

In summary, there is high confidence that large-scale patterns of {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} are well simulated by the CMIP5 models. In certain regions this agreement with observations is limited, particularly at elevations over the Himalayas and parts of both Greenland and Antarctica. The broad-scale features of precipitation as simulated by the CMIP5 models are in modest agreement with observations, but there are systematic errors in the Tropics.
