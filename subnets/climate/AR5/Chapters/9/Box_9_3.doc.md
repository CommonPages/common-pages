title: Box 9.3 - Understanding Model Performance

This Box provides a synthesis of findings on understanding model performance based on the model evaluations discussed in this chapter.

### Uncertainty in Process Representation

Some model errors can be traced to uncertainty in representation of processes (parameterizations). Some of these are long-standing issues in climate modelling, reflecting our limited, though gradually increasing, understanding of very complex processes and the inherent challenges in mathematically representing them. For the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, cloud processes, including {Glossary.*Convection convection} and its interaction with boundary layer and larger-scale circulation, remain major sources of uncertainty ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}). These in turn cause errors or {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in radiation which propagate through the coupled climate system. Distribution of aerosols is also a {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty arising from modelled microphysical processes and transport (Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 9.4.1} and {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_6 9.4.6}). Ocean models are subject to uncertainty in parameterizations of vertical and horizontal mixing and convection (Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2 9.4.2}, {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2 9.5.2} and {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 9.5.3}), and ocean errors in turn affect the atmosphere through resulting {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} biases. Simulation of {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} is also affected by errors in both the atmosphere and the ocean as well as the {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of sea ice itself ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3}). With respect to biogeochemical components in {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs}), parameterizations of nitrogen limitation and {Glossary.*Forest forest} fires are thought to be important for simulating the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, but very few ESMs incorporate these so far (Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_4 9.4.4} and {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_5 9.4.5}).

### Error Propagation

Causes of one model bias can sometimes be associated with another. Although the root cause of those biases is often unclear, knowledge of the causal chain or a set of interrelated biases can provide a key to further understanding and improvement of model performance. For example, biases in storm track position are partly due to a SST biases in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}). Some biases in variability or {Glossary.*Trend trend} can be partly traced back to biases in mean states. The decreasing trend in September Arctic ice extent tends to be underestimated when sea ice thickness is overestimated ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3}). In such cases, improvement of the mean state may improve simulated variability or trend.

### Sensitivity to {Glossary.*Resolution Resolution}

Some phenomena or aspects of climate are found to be better simulated with models run at higher horizontal and/or vertical resolution. In particular, increased resolution in the atmosphere has improved, at least in some models, storm track and extratropical cyclones ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}), diurnal variation of precipitation over land ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2 Section 9.5.2}), extreme precipitation, and tropical cyclone intensity and structure ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_4 Section 9.5.4}). Similarly, increased horizontal resolution in the ocean is shown to improve sea surface height variability, western boundary currents, tropical instability waves and coastal upwelling ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2 Section 9.4.2}), and variability of Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation meridional overturning circulation} ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 Section 9.5.3}). High vertical resolution and a high model top, as well as high horizontal resolution, are important for simulating lower stratospheric {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}), {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2 Section 9.5.2}), the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation North Atlantic Oscillation} ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 Section 9.5.3}).

### Uncertainty in Observational Data

In some cases, insufficient length or quality of observational data makes model evaluation challenging, and is a frequent problem in the evaluation of simulated variability or trends. This is evident for evaluation of upper tropical tropospheric temperature, tropical atmospheric circulation ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}), the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation Pacific Decadal Oscillation} ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 Section 9.5.3}). Data quality has been pointed out as an issue for arctic cloud properties ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}), ocean heat content, heat and fresh water fluxes over the ocean ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2 Section 9.4.2}) and extreme precipitation ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_4 Section 9.5.4}). Palaeoclimate reconstructions also have large inherent uncertainties ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2 Section 9.5.2}). It is clear therefore that updated or newly available data affect model evaluation conclusions.

### Other Factors

Model evaluation can be affected by how models are forced. Uncertainties in specified greenhouse gases, aerosols {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}, etc. will all affect model results and hence evaluation of model quality. Different statistical methods used in model evaluation can also lead to subtle or substantive differences in the assessment of model quality.
