title: 9.3.2.1 - Experiments Utilized for Model Evaluation

CMIP5 includes a much more comprehensive suite of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} than was available in the preceding CMIP3 results assessed in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.9.'Meehl_et_al_2007}). In addition to a better constrained specification of historical {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}, the CMIP5 collection also includes initialized decadal-length {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} and long-term experiments using both {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} and {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} ({cite.9.'Taylor_et_al_2012b}) ({'Figure_9_1 Figure 9.1}). The {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} forcing of these experiments is prescribed as a time series of either global mean concentrations or spatially resolved {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({Chapters.9.9_3.9_3_2.9_3_2_2 Section 9.3.2.2}). The analyses of model performance in this chapter are based on the concentration-based experiments with the exception of the evaluation of the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} (see {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_5 Section 9.4.5}).

Most of the model diagnostics are derived from the historical simulations that span the period 1850â€“2005. In some cases, these historical simulations are augmented by results from a scenario run, either RCP4.5 or {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} (see {Chapters.9.9_3.9_3_2.9_3_2_2 Section 9.3.2.2}), so as to facilitate comparison with more recent observations. CMIP5/{Glossary.*Paleoclimate Paleoclimate} Modelling Intercomparison Project version 3 (PMIP3) simulations for the mid-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} and {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum last glacial maximum} are used to evaluate model response to palaeoclimatic conditions. Historical emissions-driven simulations are used to evaluate the prognostic carbon cycle. The analysis of global {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} variability is based in part on long pre-industrial control runs to facilitate calculation of variability on decadal to centennial time scales. Idealized simulations with 1% per year increases in CO2 are utilized to derive transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}. Equilibrium climate sensitivities are derived using results of specialized experiments, with fourfold CO2 increase, designed specifically for this purpose.
