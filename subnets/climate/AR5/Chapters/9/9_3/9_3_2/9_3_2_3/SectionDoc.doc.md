title: 9.3.2.3 - Relationship of Decadal and Longer-Term Simulations

The CMIP5 archive also includes a new class of decadal-{Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} experiments ({cite.9.'Meehl_et_al_2009}, 2013b) ({'Figure_9_1 Figure 9.1}). The goal is to understand the relative roles of forced changes and {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} in historical and near-term climate variables, and to assess the {Glossary.*Predictability predictability} that might be realized on decadal time scales. These experiments comprise two sets of hindcast and prediction ensembles with initial conditions spanning 1960 through 2005. The set of 10-year ensembles are initialized starting at 1960 in 1-year increments through the year 2005 while the 30-year ensembles are initialized at 1960, 1980 and 2005. The same physical models are often used for both the short-term and long-term experiments ({'Figure_9_1 Figure 9.1}) despite the different initialization of these two sets of simulations. Results from the short-term experiments are described in detail in {Chapters.11 Chapter 11}.
