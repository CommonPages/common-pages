title: 9.3.2.2 - Forcing of the Historical Experiments

Under the protocols adopted for CMIP5 and previous assessments, the transient climate experiments are conducted in three phases. The first phase covers the start of the modern industrial period through to the present day, years 1850–2005 (van Vuuren et al., 2011). The second phase covers the future, 2006–2100, and is described by a collection of {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} ({cite.9.'Moss_et_al_2010}). As detailed in {Chapters.12 Chapter 12}, the third phase is described by a corresponding collection of Extension Concentration Pathways ({cite.9.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011}). The {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} for the historical simulations evaluated in this section and are described briefly here (with more details in Annex II).

In the CMIP3 20th century experiments, the forcings from radiatively active species other than long-lived {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and sulphate aerosols were left to the discretion of the individual modelling groups ({cite.9.'IPCC_2007}). By contrast, a comprehensive set of historical {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions and land use and land cover change data have been assembled for the CMIP5 experiments in order to produce a relatively homogeneous {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of historical simulations with common time series of forcing agents. {Topics.*Emissions Emissions} of natural aerosols including soil dust, sea salt and volcanic species are still left to the discretion of the individual modelling groups.

For {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} without chemical and biogeochemical cycles, the forcing agents are prescribed as a set of concentrations. The concentrations for GHGs and related compounds include {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}, {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}, all fluorinated gases controlled under the {Glossary.*Kyoto_Protocol Kyoto Protocol} (hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)), and {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}-depleting substances controlled under the {Glossary.*Montreal_Protocol Montreal Protocol} (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), Halons, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methyl bromide (CH3Br), methyl chloride (CH3Cl)). The concentrations for {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} species include sulphate (SO4), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), hydrophobic and hydrophilic {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon}, hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic carbon, secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and four size categories of dust and sea salt. For {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model ESMs} that include chemical and biogeochemical cycles, the forcing agents are prescribed both as a set of concentrations and as a set of emissions with provisions to separate the forcing by natural and anthropogenic CO2 ({cite.9.'Hibbard_et_al_2007}). The emissions include time-dependent spatially resolved fluxes of CH4, NOX, CO, NH3, black and organic carbon, and {Glossary.*Volatile_Organic_Compounds volatile organic compounds} (VOCs). For models that treat the chemical processes associated with {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning, emissions of additional species such as C2H4O (acetaldehyde), C2H5OH (ethanol), C2H6S (dimethylsulphide) and C3H6O (acetone) are also prescribed. Historical land use and land cover change is described in terms of the time-evolving partitioning of land surface area among cropland, pasture, primary land and secondary (recovering) land, including the effects of wood harvest and shifting cultivation, as well as land use changes and transitions from/to urban land ({cite.9.'Hurtt_et_al_2009}). These emissions data are aggregated from empirical reconstructions of grassland and {Glossary.*Forest forest} fires ({cite.9.'Schultz_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Mieville_et_al_2010}); international shipping ({cite.9.'Eyring_et_al_2010}); aviation ({cite.9.'Lee_et_al_2009}), sulphur ({cite.9.'Smith_et_al_2011b}), black and organic carbon ({cite.9.'Bond_et_al_2007}); and NOX, CO, CH4 and non methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) ({cite.9.'Lamarque_et_al_2010}) contributed by all other sectors.

For the natural forcings a recommended monthly averaged total solar irradiance time series was given, but there was no recommended treatment of volcanic forcing. Both integrated solar irradiance and its spectrum were available, but not all CMIP5 models used the spectral data. The data employed an 1850-2008 {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} of the {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} and its secular {Glossary.*Trend trend} using observations of {Glossary.*Sunspots sunspots} and faculae, the 10.7 cm solar irradiance measurements and satellite observations ({cite.9.'Frohlich_and_Lean_2004}).For volcanic forcing CMIP5 models typically employed one of two prescribed volcanic aerosol data sets ({cite.9.'Sato_et_al_1993}) or ({cite.9.'Ammann_et_al_2003}) but at least one ESM employed interactive aerosol injection ({cite.9.'Driscoll_et_al_2012}). The prescribed data sets did not incorporate injection from explosive volcanoes after 2000.
