title: 9.3.1 - The Role of Model Intercomparisons

Systematic model evaluation requires a coordinated and well-documented suite of model simulations. Organized {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison Projects} (MIPs) provide this via standard or benchmark experiments that represent critical tests of a modelâ€™s ability to simulate the observed climate. When modelling centres perform a common experiment, it offers the possibility to compare their results not just with observations, but with other models as well. This intercomparison enables researchers to explore the range of model behaviours, to isolate the various strengths and weaknesses of different models in a controlled setting, and to interpret, through idealized experiments, the inter-model differences. Benchmark MIP experiments offer a way to distinguish between errors particular to an individual model and those that might be more universal and should become priority targets for model improvement.
