title: 9.8.3 - Implications of Model Evaluation for Model Projections of Future Climate

Confidence in {Topics.*Climate_Projections climate model projections} is based on physical understanding of the climate system and its representation in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, and on a demonstration of how well models represent a wide range of processes and climate characteristics on various {Glossary.*Spatial_and_temporal_scales spatial and temporal scales} ({cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010b}). A climate model’s credibility is increased if the model is able to simulate {Topics.*Past_Climate past variations} in climate, such as trends over the 20th century and palaeoclimatic changes. Projections from previous IPCC assessments can also be directly compared to observations (see Figures {'Figure_1_4 1.4} and {'Figure_1_5 1.5}), with the caveat that these projections were not intended to be {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} over the short time scales for which observations are available to date. Unlike shorter lead forecasts, longer-term climate change projections push models into conditions outside the range observed in the historical period used for evaluation.

In some cases, the spread in climate projections can be reduced by weighting of models according to their ability to reproduce past observed climate. Several studies have explored the use of unequally weighted means, with the weights based on the models’ performance in simulating past variations in climate, typically using some performance {Glossary.*Metric metric} or collection of metrics ({cite.9.'Connolley_and_Bracegirdle_2007}; {cite.9.'Murphy_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Waugh_and_Eyring_2008}; {cite.9.'Pierce_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Reifen_and_Toumi_2009}; {cite.9.'Christensen_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010b}; {cite.9.'Raisanen_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Abe_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Shiogama_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Watterson_and_Whetton_2011}; {cite.9.'Tsushima_et_al_2013}). When applied to projections of Arctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, averages in which extra weight is given to models with the most realistic historical sea ice do give different results than the unweighted mean ({cite.9.'Stroeve_et_al_2007}, 2012; {cite.9.'Scherrer_2011}; {cite.9.'Massonnet_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Wang_and_Overland_2012}; {cite.9.'Overland_and_Wang_2013}). Another frequently used approach is the re-calibration of model outputs to a given observed value ({cite.9.'Boe_et_al_2009b}; {cite.9.'Mahlstein_and_Knutti_2012}; {cite.9.'Wang_and_Overland_2012}), see further discussion in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6.12_4_6_1 Section 12.4.6.1}. Some studies explicitly formulate a statistical frameworks that relate future observables to climate model output (reviewed in {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010b Knutti et al. (2010b)} and {cite.9.'Stephenson_et_al_2012 Stephenson et al. (2012)}). Such frameworks not only provide weights for the mean response but also allow the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the predicted response to be quantified ({cite.9.'Bracegirdle_and_Stephenson_2012}).

There are several encouraging examples of ‘emergent constraints’, which are relationships across an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of models between some aspect of {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} sensitivity and an observable {Glossary.*Trend trend} or variation in the contemporary climate ({cite.9.'Allen_and_Ingram_2002}; {cite.9.'Hall_and_Qu_2006}; {cite.9.'Eyring_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Boe_et_al_2009a}, 2009b; {cite.9.'Mahlstein_and_Knutti_2010}; {cite.9.'Son_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Huber_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Schaller_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Bracegirdle_and_Stephenson_2012}; {cite.9.'Fasullo_and_Trenberth_2012}; O’Gorman, 2012). For example, analyzing the CMIP3 ensemble, {cite.9.'Hall_and_Qu_2006 Hall and Qu (2006)} showed that inter-model variations of snow {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} in the contemporary seasonal cycle strongly correlate with comparably large inter-model variations in this feedback under future climate change. An update of this analysis with CMIP5 models added is shown in {'Figure_9_45 Figure 9.45} (left panel). This relationship presumably arises from the fact that surface albedo values in areas covered by snow vary widely across the models, particularly in the heavily vegetated boreal {Glossary.*Forest forest} zone. Models with higher surface albedos in these areas have a larger contrast between snow-covered and snow-free areas, and hence a stronger snow albedo feedback whether the context is the seasonal variation in sunshine or {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing}. Comparison with an observational estimate of snow albedo feedback reveals a large spread with both high and low biases.

The right panel of {'Figure_9_45 Figure 9.45} shows another example of an emergent constraint, where the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to warming (i.e., without {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} fertilization effects) is related to the sensitivity of the annual CO2 growth rate to tropical temperature anomalies ({cite.9.'Cox_et_al_2013}) ). The horizontal axis is the regression of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate on the tropical temperature anomaly for each model. The strong statistical relationship between these two variables is consistent with the fact that interannual variability in the CO2 growth-rate is known to be dominated by the response of tropical land to climatic anomalies, associated particularly with {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}. Thus the relationship has a physical as well as a statistical basis. The interannual sensitivity of the CO2 growth rate to tropical temperature can be estimated from observational data. Like the snow albedo feedback example, this intermodel relationship provides a credible means to reduce {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to tropical climate change.

On the other hand, many studies have failed to find strong relationships between observables and projections. {cite.9.'Whetton_et_al_2007 Whetton et al. (2007)} and {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010a Knutti et al. (2010a)} found that correlations between local to regional climatological values and projected changes are small except for a few regions. {cite.9.'Scherrer_2011 Scherrer (2011)} finds no robust relationship between the ability of the CMIP3 models to represent interannual variability of near-surface air temperature and the amplitude of future warming.{cite.9.'Raisanen_et_al_2010 Raisanen et al. (2010)} report only small (10–20%) reductions in cross-validation error of simulated 21st century temperature changes when weighting the CMIP3 models based on their simulation of the present-day climatology. The main difficulties are sparse coverage in many observed variables, short time series for observed trends, lack of correlation between observed quantities and projected past or future trends, and systematic errors in the models ({cite.9.'Tebaldi_and_Knutti_2007}; {cite.9.'Jun_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Knutti_2010}; {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010a}), the ambiguity of possible performance metrics and the difficulty of associating them with predictive skill ({cite.9.'Parker_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Gleckler_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Pincus_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Reichler_and_Kim_2008}; {cite.9.'Pierce_et_al_2009}; {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2010a}).

Emergent constraints can be difficult to identify if climate models are structurally similar and share common biases, thereby reducing the effective ensemble size. Comparison of emergent constraints in MMEs from different modelling experiments can help reveal which constraints are robust ({cite.9.'Massonnet_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Bracegirdle_and_Stephenson_2013}). Another issue is that testing of large numbers of predictors will find statistically significant correlations that do not remain significant in a different ensemble. This is particularly important if many predictors are tested using only small ensembles like CMIP3 ({cite.9.'DelSole_and_Shukla_2009}; {cite.9.'Raisanen_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Huber_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Masson_and_Knutti_2013}). All of these potential pitfalls underscore the need for analysis of the mechanism underpinning the statistical relationship between current and future climate parameters for any proposed emergent constraint.
