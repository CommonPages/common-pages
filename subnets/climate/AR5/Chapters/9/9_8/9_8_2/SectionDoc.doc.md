title: 9.8.2 - Implications of Model Evaluation for Climate Change Detection and Attribution

The evaluation of model simulations of historical climate is of direct relevance to {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} (D&A) studies ({Chapters.10 Chapter 10}) since these rely on model-derived patterns (or ‘fingerprints’) of {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing}, and on the ability of models to simulate decadal and longer-time scale {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} ({cite.9.'Hegerl_and_Zwiers_2011}). Conversely, D&A research contributes to model evaluation through estimation of the amplitude of modeled response to various forcings ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_3 Section 10.3.1.1.3}). The estimated {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} for some variables such as water vapor is governed by basic physical processes that are well represented in models and are rather insensitive to model {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2009}). {'Figure_9_44 Figure 9.44} illustrates slight improvements in the representation of some of the modes of variability and climate phenomena discussed in Sections {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2 9.5.2} and {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3 9.5.3}, suggesting with medium confidence that models now better reproduce internal variability. On the other hand, biases that affect D&A studies remain. An example is the warm bias of lower-{Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} temperature trends during the satellite period ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_4.9_4_1_4_5 Section 9.4.1.4.5}) that can be linked to uncertainties in stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} forcing ({cite.9.'Solomon_et_al_2012}; {cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2013}). Recent studies of climate extremes ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_4 Section 9.5.4}) also provide evidence that models have reasonable skill in these important attributes of a changing climate; however, there is an indication that models have difficulties in reproducing the right balance between historical changes in cold and warm extremes. They also confirm that {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} affects the confidence that can be placed in the analyses of extreme in precipitation. D&A studies focussed on {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} are therefore constrained by current model limitations. Lastly, some D&A studies have incorporated model quality results by repeating a multi-model analysis with only the models that agree best with observations ({cite.9.'Santer_et_al_2009}). This model discrimination or weighting is less problematic for D&A analysis than it is for model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate} ({Chapters.9.9_8.9_8_3 Section 9.8.3}), because D&A research is focussed on historical and control-run simulations which can be directly evaluated against observations.
