title: 9.7.3.1 - Constraints on Climate Sensitivity from Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity

An EMIC intercomparison ({cite.9.'Eby_et_al_2013}; {cite.9.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}) allows an assessment of model response characteristics, including ECS, TCR, and heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} efficiency ({'Table_9_6 Table 9.6}). In addition, Bayesian methods applied to PPE experiments using {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} have estimated {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in model response characteristics (see {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}) based on simulated climate change in 20th century, past millennia, and {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. Here, the range of response metrics ({'Table_9_6 Table 9.6}) described for default model configurations ({cite.9.'Eby_et_al_2013}) indicates consistency with the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}.
