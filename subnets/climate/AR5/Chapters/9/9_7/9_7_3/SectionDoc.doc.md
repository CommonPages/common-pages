title: 9.7.3 - Climate Sensitivity and Model Performance

Despite the range in equilibrium sensitivity of 2.1°C to 4.4°C for CMIP3 models, they reproduce the global surface air temperature anomaly of 0.76°C over 1850–2005 to within 25% relative error. The relatively small range of historical {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} suggests that there is another mechanism, for example a compensating non-GHG {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}, present in the historical simulations that counteracts the relatively large range in sensitivity obtained from idealized experiments forced only by increasing {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}. One possible mechanism is a systematic negative correlation across the multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} between ECS and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} forcing ({cite.9.'Kiehl_2007}; {cite.9.'Knutti_2008}; {cite.9.'Anderson_et_al_2010}). A second possible mechanism is a systematic overestimate of the mixing between the oceanic mixed layer and the full depth ocean underneath ({cite.9.'Hansen_et_al_2011}). However, despite the same range of ECS in the CMIP5 models as in the CMIP3 models, there is no significant relationship across the CMIP5 ensemble between ECS and the 20th-century {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} applied to each individual model ({cite.9.'Forster_et_al_2013}). This indicates a lesser role of compensating ERF trends from {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and aerosols in CMIP5 historical simulations than in CMIP3. Differences in ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} also do not appreciably affect the spread in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} changes in {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature} by 2095 ({cite.9.'Forster_et_al_2013}).
