title: 9.7.3.2 - Climate Sensitivity During the Last Glacial Maximum

{Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity Climate sensitivity} can also be explored in another climatic context. The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessed attempts to relate simulated {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} changes in tropical {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} to global climate sensitivity ({cite.9.'Hegerl_et_al_2007}; {cite.9.'Knutti_and_Hegerl_2008}). LGM temperature changes in the tropics ({cite.9.'Hargreaves_et_al_2007}), but not in Antarctica ({cite.9.'Hargreaves_et_al_2012}), have been shown to scale well with climate sensitivity because the signal is mostly dominated by {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} forcing in these regions ({cite.9.'Braconnot_et_al_2007b}; {cite.9.'Jansen_et_al_2007}). The analogy between the LGM climate sensitivity and future climate sensitivity is, however, not perfect ({cite.9.'Crucifix_2006}). In a single-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of simulations, the magnitudes of the LGM cooling and the warming induced by a doubling of CO2 are nonlinear in the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} applied ({cite.9.'Hargreaves_et_al_2007}). Differences in the cloud radiative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} are at the origin of this asymmetric response to equivalent positive and negative forcings ({cite.9.'Yoshimori_et_al_2009}). There is thus still low confidence that the regional LGM model-data comparisons can be used to evaluate model climate sensitivity. However, even if the results do not scale perfectly with equilibrium or transient climate sensitivity, the LGM simulations allow the identification of the different feedback factors that contributed to the LGM global cooling ({cite.9.'Yoshimori_et_al_2011}) and {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in these feedbacks. The largest spread in LGM model feedbacks is found for the shortwave {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback}, just as for the modern climate. This correspondence between LGM and modern climates adds to the high confidence that the shortwave cloud feedback is the dominant {Glossary.*Source source} of model spread in climate sensitivity (cf. {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3 Section 5.3.3}).
