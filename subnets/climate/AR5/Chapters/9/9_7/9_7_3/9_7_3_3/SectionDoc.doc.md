title: 9.7.3.3 - Constraints on Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity from Climate-Model Ensembles and Observations

The large scale climatological information available has so far been insufficient to constrain model behaviour to a range tighter than CMIP3, at least on a global scale. {cite.9.'Sanderson_and_Knutti_2012 Sanderson and Knutti (2012)} suggest that much of the available and commonly used large scale observations have already been used to develop and evaluate models and are therefore of limited value to further constrain {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} or TCR. The assessed literature suggests that the range of climate sensitivities and transient responses covered by CMIP3/5 cannot be narrowed significantly by constraining the models with observations of the mean climate and variability, consistent with the difficulty of constraining the cloud feedbacks from observations (see {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). Studies based on PPE and CMIP3 support the conclusion that a credible representation of the mean climate and variability is very difficult to achieve with equilibrium climate sensitivities below 2째C ({cite.9.'Piani_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Stainforth_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Sanderson_et_al_2008a}, 2008b; {cite.9.'Huber_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Klocke_et_al_2011}; {cite.9.'Fasullo_and_Trenberth_2012}). High climate sensitivity values above 5째C (in some cases above 10째C) are found in the PPE based on HadAM/HadCM3. Several recent studies find that such high values cannot be excluded based on climatological constraints, but comparison with observations shows the smallest errors for many fields if ECS is between 3 and 4째C ({cite.9.'Piani_et_al_2005}; {cite.9.'Knutti_et_al_2006}; {cite.9.'Rodwell_and_Palmer_2007}; {cite.9.'Sanderson_et_al_2008a}, 2008b, 2010; {cite.9.'Sanderson_2011}, 2013).
