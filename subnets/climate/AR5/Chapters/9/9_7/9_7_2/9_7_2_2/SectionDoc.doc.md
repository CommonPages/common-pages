title: 9.7.2.2 - Role of Surface Albedo in Climate Sensitivity

Analysis of observed declines in {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} and snow coverage from 1979 to 2008 suggests that the NH {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} is between 0.3 and 1.1 W m–2 °C–1 ({cite.9.'Flanner_et_al_2011}). This range is substantially above the global feedback of 0.3 ± 0.1 W m–2 °C–1 of the CMIP5 models analysed in {'Table_9_5 Table 9.5}. One possible explanation is that the CMIP5 models underestimate the strength of the feedback as did the CMIP3 models based upon the systematic errors in simulated sea ice coverage decline relative to observed rates ({cite.9.'Boe_et_al_2009b}).
