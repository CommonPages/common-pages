title: 9.7.2.4 - Relationship of Feedbacks to Modelled Climate Sensitivity
section 9_7_2_4

  |The ECS can be estimated from the ratio of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} to the total climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} parameter. This approach is applicable to simulations in which the net radiative balance is much smaller than the forcing and hence the modelled climate system is essentially in equilibrium.
