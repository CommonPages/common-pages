title: 9.7.2.1 - Role of Humidity and Lapse Rate Feedbacks in Climate Sensitivity

The compensation between the water vapour and lapse-rate feedbacks noted in the CMIP3 models is still present in the CMIP5 models, and possible explanations of the compensation have been developed ({cite.9.'Ingram_2010}; {cite.9.'Ingram_2013}). New formulations of the feedbacks, replacing specific with {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity}, eliminate most of the cancellation between the water vapour and {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} feedbacks and reduce the inter-model scatter in the individual {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} terms ({cite.9.'Held_and_Shell_2012}).
