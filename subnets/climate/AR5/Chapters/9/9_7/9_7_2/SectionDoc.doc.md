title: 9.7.2 - Understanding the Range in Model Climate Sensitivity: Climate Feedbacks

The strengths of individual feedbacks for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models are compared in {'Figure_9_43 Figure 9.43}. The feedbacks are generally similar between CMIP3 and CMIP5, and the water vapour, {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate}, and cloud feedbacks are assessed in detail in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}. The surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} is assessed here to be likely positive. There is high confidence that the sum of all feedbacks (excluding the Planck feedback) is positive. Advances in estimating and understanding each of the feedback parameters in {'Table_9_5 Table 9.5} are described in detail below (see also Chapters {Chapters.7} and {Chapters.8}).
