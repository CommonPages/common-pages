title: 9.7.2.5 - Relationship of Feedbacks to Uncertainty in Modelled Climate Sensitivity

Objective methods for perturbing uncertain model parameters to optimize performance relative to a set of observational metrics have shown a tendency toward an increase in the mean and a narrowing of the spread of estimated {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} ({cite.9.'Jackson_et_al_2008a}). This tendency is opposed by the effects of structural biases related to incomplete process representations in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}. If common structural biases are replicated across models in a MME (cf. Section 9.2.2.7), the most likely sensitivity for the MME tends to shift towards lower sensitivities while the possibility of larger sensitivities increases at the same time ({cite.9.'Lemoine_2010}). Following {cite.9.'Schlesinger_and_Mitchell_1987 Schlesinger and Mitchell (1987)}, {cite.9.'Roe_and_Baker_2007 Roe and Baker (2007)} suggest that symmetrically distributed {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in feedbacks lead to inherently asymmetrical uncertainties in climate sensitivity with increased probability in extreme positive values of the sensitivity. {cite.9.'Roe_and_Baker_2007 Roe and Baker (2007)} conclude that this relationship makes it extremely difficult to reduce uncertainties in climate sensitivity through incremental improvements in the specification of {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} parameters. While subsequent analysis has suggested that this finding could be an artifact of the statistical formulation ({cite.9.'Hannart_et_al_2009}) and linearization ({cite.9.'Zaliapin_and_Ghil_2010}) of the relationship between feedback and sensitivity adopted by ({cite.9.'Roe_and_Baker_2007}), these issues remain unsettled ({cite.9.'Roe_and_Armour_2011}; {cite.9.'Roe_and_Baker_2011}).
