title: 9.7.2.3 - Role of Cloud Feedbacks in Climate Sensitivity

Cloud feedbacks represent the main cause for the range in modelled {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} ({Chapters.7 Chapter 7}). The spread due to inter-model differences in cloud feedbacks is approximately 3 times larger than the spread contributed by feedbacks due to variations in water vapour and {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} combined ({cite.9.'Dufresne_and_Bony_2008}), and is a primary factor governing the range of climate sensitivity across the CMIP3 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} ({cite.9.'Volodin_2008a}). Differences in equilibrium and effective climate sensitivity are due primarily to differences in the shortwave cloud {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({cite.9.'Yokohata_et_al_2008}).

In perturbed ensembles of three different models, the primary cloud-related factor contributing to the spread in {Glossary.*Equilibrium_climate_sensitivity equilibrium climate sensitivity} is the low-level shortwave {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} ({cite.9.'Yokohata_et_al_2010}; {cite.9.'Klocke_et_al_2011}). Changes in the high-altitude clouds also induce climate feedbacks due to the large areal extent and significant longwave cloud radiative effects of tropical convective cloud systems. In experiments with perturbed physics ensembles of {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}, the {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of ice fall speed also emerges as one of the most important determinants of climate sensitivity ({cite.9.'Sanderson_et_al_2008a}, 2010; {cite.9.'Sexton_et_al_2012}). Other non-microphysical feedback mechanisms are detailed in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7}.

Cloud feedbacks in AOGCMs are generally positive or near neutral ({cite.9.'Shell_et_al_2008}; {cite.9.'Soden_et_al_2008}), as evidenced by the net positive or neutral cloud feedbacks in all of the models examined in a multi-thousand member ensemble of AOGCMs constructed by parameter perturbations ({cite.9.'Sanderson_et_al_2010}). The sign of cloud feedbacks in the current climate deduced from observed relationships between SSTs and TOA radiative fluxes are discussed further in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_7 Section 7.2.5.7}.
