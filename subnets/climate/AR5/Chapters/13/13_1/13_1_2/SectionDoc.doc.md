title: 13.1.2 - Fundamental Definitions and Concepts

The height of the ocean surface at any given location, or sea level, is measured either with respect to the surface of the solid Earth (relative sea level (RSL)) or a geocentric reference such as the reference ellipsoid (geocentric sea level). RSL is the more relevant quantity when considering the coastal impacts of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change}, and it has been measured using tide gauges during the past few centuries (Sections {Chapters.13.13_2.13_2_2 13.2.2} and {Chapters.3.3_7 3.7}) and estimated for longer time spans from geological records (Sections {Chapters.13.13_2.13_2_1 13.2.1} and {Chapters.5.5_6 5.6}). Geocentric sea level has been measured over the past two decades using satellite {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} (Sections {Chapters.13.13_2.13_2_2 13.2.2} and {Chapters.3.3_7 3.7}).

A temporal average for a given location, known as Mean Sea Level (MSL; see Glossary), is applied to remove shorter period variability. Apart from {Chapters.13.13_7 Section 13.7}, which considers high-frequency changes in ocean surface height, the use of ‘sea level’ elsewhere in this chapter refers to MSL. It is common to average MSL spatially to define global {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level} (GMSL; see Glossary). In principle, integrating RSL change over the ocean area gives the change in ocean water volume, which is directly related to the processes that dominate {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} (changes in ocean temperature and land-ice volume). In contrast, a small correction (–0.15 to –0.5 mm yr–1) needs to be subtracted from altimetry observations to estimate ocean water volume change ({cite.13.'Tamisiea_2011}). Local RSL change can differ significantly from GMSL because of spatial variability in changes of the sea surface and ocean floor height (see {FAQ_13_1 FAQ 13.1} and {Chapters.13.13_6 Section 13.6}).
