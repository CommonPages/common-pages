title: 13.1.1 - Introduction and Chapter Overview

Changes in sea level occur over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales, with the many contributing factors making it an integral measure of climate change ({cite.13.'Milne_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Church_et_al_2010}). The primary contributors to contemporary {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} are the expansion of the ocean as it warms and the transfer of water currently stored on land to the ocean, particularly from land ice (glaciers and ice sheets) ({cite.13.'Church_et_al_2011a}). Observations indicate the largest increase in the storage of heat in the climate system over recent decades has been in the oceans ({Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}) and thus sea level rise from ocean warming is a central part of the Earth’s response to increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} (GHG) concentrations.

The First IPCC Assessment Report ({cite.1.'IPCC_1990 FAR}) laid the groundwork for much of our current understanding of {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} ({cite.13.'Warrick_and_Oerlemans_1990}). This included the recognition that sea level had risen during the 20th century, that the rate of rise had increased compared to the 19th century, that ocean {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} and the mass loss from glaciers were the main contributors to the 20th century rise, that during the 21st century the rate of rise was projected to be faster than during the 20th century, that sea level will not rise uniformly around the world, and that sea level would continue to rise well after GHG {Topics.*Emissions emissions} are reduced. They also concluded that no major dynamic response of the ice sheets was expected during the 21st century, leaving ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers as the main contributors to the 21st century rise. The Second Assessment Report ({cite.1.'IPCC_1996 SAR}) came to very similar conclusions ({cite.13.'Warrick_et_al_1996}).

By the time of the Third Assessment Report ({cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR}), coupled {Topics.*Climate_System Atmosphere}–Ocean General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}) and ice-sheet models largely replaced {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} as the primary techniques supporting the interpretation of observations and the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of sea level ({cite.13.'Church_et_al_2001}). This approach allowed consideration of the regional distribution of sea level change in addition to the global average change. By the time of the Fourth Assessment Report ({cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}), there were more robust observations of the variations in the rate of global average sea level rise for the 20th century, some understanding of the variability in the rate of rise, and the satellite altimeter record was long enough to reveal the complexity of the time-variable spatial distribution of sea level ({cite.13.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}). Nevertheless, three central issues remained. First, the observed sea level rise over decades was larger than the sum of the individual contributions estimated from observations or with models ({cite.13.'Rahmstorf_et_al_2007}, 2012a), although in general the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} were large enough that there was no significant contradiction. Second, it was not possible to make confident projections of the regional distribution of sea level rise. Third, there was insufficient understanding of the potential contributions from the ice sheets. In particular, the AR4 recognized that existing ice-sheet models were unable to simulate the recent observations of ice-sheet accelerations and that understanding of ice-sheet dynamics was too limited to assess the {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of continued acceleration or to provide a best estimate or an upper bound for their future contributions.

Despite changes in the {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} between the four Assessments, the sea level projections for 2100 (compared to 1990) for the full range of scenarios were remarkably similar, with the reduction in the upper end in more recent reports reflecting the smaller increase in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF) in recent scenarios due to smaller GHG emissions and the inclusion of aerosols, and a reduction in uncertainty in projecting the contributions: 31 to 110 cm in the FAR, 13 to 94 cm in the SAR, 9 to 88 cm in the TAR and 18 to 59 cm in AR4 (not including a possible additional allowance for a dynamic ice-sheet response).

Results since the AR4 show that for recent decades, sea level has continued to rise ({Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7}). Improved and new observations of the ocean ({Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7}) and the {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere} ({Chapters.4 Chapter 4}) and their representation in models have resulted in better understanding of 20th century sea level rise and its components (this chapter). Records of past sea level changes constrain long-term land-ice response to warmer climates as well as extend the observational record to provide a longer context for current sea level rise ({Chapters.5.5_6 Section 5.6}).

This chapter provides a synthesis of past and contemporary sea level change at global and regional scales. Drawing on the published refereed literature, including as summarized in earlier chapters of this Assessment, we explain the reasons for contemporary change and assess confidence in and provide global and regional projections of likely sea level change for the 21st century and beyond. We discuss the primary factors that cause regional sea level to differ from the global average and how these may change in the future. In addition, we address projected changes in surface waves and the consequences of sea level and climate change for {Glossary.*Extreme_sea_level extreme sea level} events.
