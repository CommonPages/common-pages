title: 13.1.4 - Models Used to Interpret Past and Project Future Changes in Sea Level

{Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} have components representing the ocean, {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, land, and {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}, and simulate sea surface height changes relative to the {Glossary.*Geoid geoid} resulting from the natural {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} of volcanic eruptions and changes in solar irradiance, and from {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} increases in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} and aerosols ({Chapters.9 Chapter 9}). AOGCMs also exhibit internally generated {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, including such modes as the El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}), the North Atlantic Oscillation ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}) and others that affect {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} ({cite.13.'White_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Zhang_and_Church_2012}). Critical components for global and regional changes in sea level are changes in surface wind stress and air–sea heat and freshwater fluxes ({cite.13.'Lowe_and_Gregory_2006}; {cite.13.'Timmermann_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Suzuki_and_Ishii_2011}) and the resultant changes in ocean density and circulation, for instance in the strength of the Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation Meridional Overturning Circulation} (AMOC) ({cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Lorbacher_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2011a}). As in the real world, ocean density, circulation and sea level are dynamically connected in AOGCMs and evolve together. Offline models are required for simulating {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} and ice-sheet changes ({Chapters.13.13_1.13_1_4.13_1_4_1 Section 13.1.4.1}).

Geodynamic surface-loading models are used to simulate the RSL response to past and contemporary changes in surface water and landice mass redistribution and contemporary atmospheric pressure changes. The sea surface height component of the calculation is based solely on {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} conservation and perturbations to gravity, with no considerations of ocean dynamic effects. Application of these models has focussed on annual and interannual variability driven by contemporary changes in the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} and atmospheric loading ({cite.13.'Clarke_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Tamisiea_et_al_2010}), and on secular trends associated with past and contemporary changes in land ice and hydrology ({cite.13.'Lambeck_et_al_1998}; {cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2001}; {cite.13.'Peltier_2004}; {cite.13.'Riva_et_al_2010}).

Semi-empirical models (SEMs) project sea level based on statistical relationships between observed GMSL and {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature} ({cite.13.'Rahmstorf_2007a}; {cite.13.'Vermeer_and_Rahmstorf_2009}; {cite.13.'Grinsted_et_al_2010}) or total RF ({cite.13.'Jevrejeva_et_al_2009}, 2010). The form of this relationship is motivated by physical considerations, and the parameters are determined from observational data—hence the term ‘semi-empirical’ ({cite.13.'Rahmstorf_et_al_2012b}). SEMs do not explicitly simulate the underlying processes, and they use a characteristic {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} that could be considerably longer than the time scale of interest ({cite.13.'Rahmstorf_2007a}) or one that is explicitly determined by the model ({cite.13.'Grinsted_et_al_2010}).

Storm-surge and wave-{Topics.*Climate_Projections projection} models are used to assess how changes in storminess and MSL impact sea level extremes and wave climates. The two main approaches involve dynamical ({cite.13.'Lowe_et_al_2010}) and statistical models ({cite.13.'Wang_et_al_2010}). The dynamical models are forced by near-surface wind and {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level} pressure fields derived from regional or global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.13.'Lowe_et_al_2010}).

In this chapter, we use the term ‘process-based models’ (see Glossary) to refer to sea level and land-ice models ({Chapters.13.13_1.13_1_4.13_1_4_1 Section 13.1.4.1}) that aim to simulate the underlying processes and interactions, in contrast to ‘semi-empirical models’ which do not. Although these two approaches are distinct, semi-empirical methods are often employed in components of the process-based models (e.g., glacier models in which surface mass balance is determined by a degree-day method ({cite.13.'Braithwaite_and_Olesen_1989})).
