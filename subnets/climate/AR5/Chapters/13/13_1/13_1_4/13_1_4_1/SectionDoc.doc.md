title: 13.1.4.1 - Models Used to Project Changes in Ice Sheets and Glaciers

The representation of glaciers and ice sheets within {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} is not yet at a stage where projections of their changing mass are routinely available. Additional process-based models use output from AOGCMs to evaluate the consequences of projected climate change on these ice masses.

The overall contribution of an ice mass to sea level involves changes to either its surface mass balance (SMB) or changes in the dynamics of ice flow that affect outflow (i.e., solid ice discharge) to the ocean. SMB is primarily the difference between snow {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} and the melt and sublimation of snow and ice (ablation). An assessment of observations related to this mass budget can be found in {Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2 Section 4.4.2}. Although some ice-sheet models used in projections incorporate both effects, most studies have focussed on either SMB or flow dynamics. It is assumed that the overall contribution can be found by summing the contributions calculated independently for these two sources, which is valid if they do not interact significantly. Although this can be addressed using a correction term to SMB in ice-sheet projections over the next century, such interactions become more important on longer time scales when, for example, changes in ice-sheet topography may significantly affect SMB or dynamics.

Projecting the sea level contribution of land ice requires comparing the model results with a base state that assumes no significant sea level contribution. This base state is taken to be either the pre-industrial period or, because of our scant knowledge of the ice sheets before the advent of satellites, the late 20th century. In reality, even at these times, the ice sheets may have been contributing to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} ({cite.13.'Huybrechts_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Box_and_Colgan_2013}) and this contribution, although difficult to quantify, should be included in the observed sea level budget ({cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013b}).

{Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model Regional Climate Models} (RCMs), which incorporate or are coupled to sophisticated representations of the mass and {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budgets} associated with snow and ice surfaces, are now the primary {Glossary.*Source source} of ice-sheet SMB projections. A major source of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} lies in the ability of these schemes to adequately represent the process of internal refreezing of melt water within the snowpack ({cite.13.'Bougamont_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Fausto_et_al_2009}). These models require information on the state of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and ocean at their lateral boundaries, which are derived from {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis data} sets or AOGCMs for {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate}, or from AOGCM {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate}.

Models of ice dynamics require a fairly complete representation of stresses within an ice mass in order to represent the response of ice flow to changes at the marine boundary and the governing longitudinal stresses ({cite.13.'Schoof_2007a}). For Antarctica, there is also a need to employ high spatial {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} (<1 km) to capture the dynamics of {Glossary.*Grounding_line grounding line} migration robustly so that results do not depend to an unreasonable extent on model resolution ({cite.13.'Durand_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Goldberg_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Morlighem_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Cornford_et_al_2013}; {cite.13.'Pattyn_et_al_2013}). One-dimensional flowline models have been developed to the stage that modelled iceberg {Glossary.*Calving calving} is comparable with observations ({cite.13.'Nick_et_al_2009}). The success of this modelling approach relies on the ability of the model’s computational grid to evolve to continuously track the migrating calving front. Although this is relatively straightforward in a one-dimensional model, this technique is difficult to incorporate into three-dimensional ice-sheet models that typically use a computational grid that is fixed in space.

The main challenge faced by models attempting to assess {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} from glaciers is the small number of glaciers for which mass budget observations are available (about 380) ({cite.13.'Cogley_2009a}) (see Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.4) as compared to the total number (the Randolph {Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} Inventory contains more than 170,000) ({cite.13.'Arendt_et_al_2012}). Statistical techniques are used to derive relations between observed SMB and climate variables for the small sample of surveyed glaciers, and then these relations are used to upscale to regions of the world. These techniques often include volume–area scaling to estimate glacier volume from their more readily observable areas. Although tidewater glaciers may also be affected by changes in outflow related to calving, the complexity of the associated processes means that most studies limit themselves to assessing the effects of SMB changes.
