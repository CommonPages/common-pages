title: 13.1.3 - Processes Affecting Sea Level

This chapter focusses on processes within the ocean, {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, land ice, and {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} that are climate sensitive and are expected to contribute to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} at regional to global scales in the coming decades to centuries ({'Figure_13_1 Figure 13.1}). {'Figure_13_2 Figure 13.2} is a navigation aid for the different sections of this chapter and sections of other chapters that are relevant to {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change}.

Changes in ocean currents, ocean density and sea level are all tightly coupled such that changes at one location impact local sea level and sea level far from the location of the initial change, including changes in sea level at the coast in response to changes in open-ocean temperature ({cite.13.'Landerer_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2010}). Although both temperature and salinity changes can contribute significantly to regional sea level change ({cite.13.'Church_et_al_2010}), only temperature change produces a significant contribution to global average ocean volume change due to {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} or contraction ({cite.13.'Gregory_and_Lowe_2000}). Regional atmospheric pressure anomalies also cause sea level to vary through atmospheric loading ({cite.13.'Wunsch_and_Stammer_1997}). All of these climate-sensitive processes cause sea level to vary on a broad range of space and time scales from relatively short-lived events, such as waves and storm surges, to sustained changes over several decades or centuries that are associated with atmospheric and ocean modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} ({cite.13.'White_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Miller_and_Douglas_2007}; {cite.13.'Zhang_and_Church_2012}).

Water and ice mass exchange between the land and the oceans leads to a change in GMSL. A signal of added mass to the ocean propagates rapidly around the globe such that all regions experience a sea level change within days of the mass being added ({cite.13.'Lorbacher_et_al_2012}). In addition, an influx of freshwater changes ocean temperature and salinity and thus changes ocean currents and local sea level ({cite.13.'Stammer_2008}; {cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2009}), with signals taking decades to propagate around the global ocean. The coupled {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}–ocean system can also adjust to temperature anomalies associated with surface freshwater anomalies through air–sea feedbacks, resulting in dynamical adjustments of sea level ({cite.13.'Okumura_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Stammer_et_al_2011}). {Glossary.*Water_mass Water mass} exchange between land and the ocean also results in patterns of sea level change called ‘sea level fingerprints’ ({cite.13.'Clark_and_Lingle_1977}; {cite.13.'Conrad_and_Hager_1997}; {cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2001}) due to change in the gravity field and vertical movement of the ocean floor associated with visco-elastic Earth deformation ({cite.13.'Farrell_and_Clark_1976}). These changes in mass distribution also affect the Earth’s inertia tensor and therefore rotation, which produces an additional sea level response ({cite.13.'Milne_and_Mitrovica_1998}).

There are other processes that affect sea level but are not associated with contemporary climate change. Some of these result in changes that are large enough to influence the interpretation of observational records and sea level {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} at regional and global scales. In particular, surface mass transfer from land ice to oceans during the last {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} contributes significantly to present-day sea level change due to the ongoing visco-elastic deformation of the Earth and the corresponding changes of the ocean floor height and gravity (referred to as glacial {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} adjustment ({Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA})) ({cite.13.'Lambeck_and_Nakiboglu_1984}; {cite.13.'Peltier_and_Tushingham_1991}). Ice sheets also have long response times and so continue to respond to {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} change (Section 13.1.5).

{Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} processes that influence the amount of water stored in the ground or on its surface in lakes and reservoirs, or cause changes in land surface characteristics that influence {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} or {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration} rates, will perturb the hydrological cycle and cause sea level change ({cite.13.'Sahagian_2000}; {cite.13.'Wada_et_al_2010}). Such processes include water impoundment (dams, reservoirs), irrigation schemes, and groundwater depletion ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_5 Section 13.4.5}).

Sea level changes due to tectonic and coastal processes are beyond the scope of this chapter. With the exception of earthquakes, which can cause rapid local changes and tsunamis ({cite.13.'Broerse_et_al_2011}) and secular RSL changes due to post-seismic deformation ({cite.13.'Watson_et_al_2010}), tectonic processes cause, on average, relatively low rates of sea level change (order 0.1 mm yr–1 or less; {cite.13.'Moucha_et_al_2008}). Sediment transfer and compaction (including from ground water depletion) in the coastal zone are particularly important in deltaic regions ({cite.13.'Blum_and_Roberts_2009}; {cite.13.'Syvitski_et_al_2009}). Although they can dominate sea level change in these localized areas, they are less important as a {Glossary.*Source source} of sea level change at regional and global scales and so are not considered further in this chapter (see discussion in Working Group II, {Chapters.5 Chapter 5}). Estimates of sediment delivery to the oceans ({cite.13.'Syvitski_and_Kettner_2011}) suggest a contribution to GMSL rise of order 0.01 mm yr–1.
