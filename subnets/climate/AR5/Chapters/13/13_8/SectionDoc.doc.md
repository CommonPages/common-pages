title: 13.8 - Synthesis and Key Uncertainties

There has been significant progress in our understanding of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Paleo data now provide high confidence that sea levels were substantially higher when GHG concentrations were higher or {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} were warmer than pre-industrial. The combination of paleo sea level data and long {Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge} records confirms that the rate of rise has increased from low rates of change during the late {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} (order tenths of mm yr–1) to rates of almost 2 mm yr–1 averaged over the 20th century, with a likely continuing acceleration during the 20th century ({'Figure_13_27 Figure 13.27}). Since 1993, the sum of observed contributions to sea level rise is in good agreement with the observed rise.

Understanding of the components that contribute to total sea level rise has improved significantly. For the 20th century, the range from an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of such process-based models encompasses the observed rise when allowances are made for lack of inclusion of volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} in {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM} control simulations, natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, and a possible small long-term ice-sheet contribution. Ice-sheet contributions to the 20th century sea level rise were small, however, and this agreement is thus not an evaluation of ice-sheet models. Nevertheless, there has been significant improvement in accounting for important physical processes in ice-sheet models, particularly of the dynamical response of individual {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} systems to warmer ocean waters in the immediate vicinity of the outlet glaciers. Although there are as yet no complete simulations of regional ocean temperature changes near ice sheets and of the ice-sheet response to realistic climate change forcing, the publications to date have allowed an assessment of the likely range of sea level rise for the 21st century ({'Figure_13_27 Figure 13.27}).

These observations, together with our current scientific understanding and {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections of future climate} and sea level, imply that it is virtually certain that sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century and beyond. For the first few decades of the 21st century, regional {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} will be dominated by climate variability superimposed on the climate change signal. For all {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, the rate of 21st century GMSL rise is very likely to exceed the average rate during the 20th century. For the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario, the projected rate of GMSL rise by the end of the 21st century will approach average rates experienced during the {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} of the Earth after the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum Last Glacial Maximum}. These rates imply a significant transfer of mass from the ice sheets to the oceans and associated regional departures of sea level rise from the global average, in addition to the regional patterns from changing {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean interactions.

Sea level rise has already led to a significant increase in the return frequency of sea level extremes at many locations, and it is very likely that this will continue during the 21st century, although there is low confidence in projections of changes in storminess. The first assessment of surface waves indicates a likely (medium confidence) increase in the height of waves in the Southern Ocean.

Despite this progress, significant {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} remain, particularly related to the magnitude and rate of the ice-sheet contribution for the 21st century and beyond, the regional distribution of sea level rise, and the regional changes in storm frequency and intensity. For coastal planning, sea level rise needs to be considered in a risk management framework, requiring knowledge of the frequency of sea level variability (from climate variability and {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events}) in future climates, projected changes in {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level}, and the uncertainty of the sea level projections ({cite.13.'Hunter_2010}, 2012), as well as local issues such as the compaction of sediments in deltaic regions and the changing supply of these sediments to maintain the height of the deltas ({cite.13.'Syvitski_et_al_2009}). Although improved understanding has allowed the {Glossary.*Projection projection} of a likely range of sea level rise during the 21st century, it has not been possible to quantify a very likely range or give an upper bound to future rise. The potential collapse of ice shelves, as observed on the Antarctic Peninsula ({cite.13.'Rignot_et_al_2004}; {cite.13.'Scambos_et_al_2004}; {cite.13.'Rott_et_al_2011}), could lead to a larger 21st century rise of up to several tenths of a metre.

Sea level will continue to rise for centuries, even if GHG concentrations are stabilized, with the amount of rise dependent on future GHG {Topics.*Emissions emissions}. For higher emission scenarios and warmer temperatures, surface melting of the Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} is projected to exceed {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation}, leading to its long-term decay and a sea level rise of metres, consistent with paleo sea level data.
