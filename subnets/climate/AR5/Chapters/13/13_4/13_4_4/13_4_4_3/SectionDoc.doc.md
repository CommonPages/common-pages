title: 13.4.4.3 - Possible Irreversibility of Ice Loss from West Antarctica

Due to relatively weak snowfall on Antarctica and the slow ice motion in its interior, it can be expected that the WAIS would take at least several thousand years to regrow if it was eliminated by dynamic ice discharge. Consequently any significant ice loss from West Antarctic that occurs within the next century will be irreversible on a multi-centennial to millennial time scale. We discuss here the possibility of abrupt dynamic ice loss from West Antarctica (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5 Section 12.5.5} for definition of abrupt).

Information on the ice and bed topography of WAIS suggests that it has about 3.3 m of equivalent global {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} grounded on areas with downward sloping bedrock ({cite.13.'Bamber_et_al_2009}). As detailed in {Box_13_2 Box 13.2}, large areas of the WAIS may therefore be subject to potential ice loss via the MISI. As it is the case for other potential instabilities within the climate system ({Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5 Section 12.5.5}), there are four lines of evidence to assess the {Glossary.*Likelihood likelihood} of a potential occurrence: theoretical understanding, present-day observations, numerical simulations, and paleo records.

The MISI is based on a number of studies that indicated the theoretical existence of the instability ({cite.13.'Weertman_1961}; {cite.13.'Schoof_2007a}) (see also {Box_13_2 Box 13.2}). The most fundamental derivation, that is, starting from a first-principle ice equation, states that in one-dimensional ice flow the {Glossary.*Grounding_line grounding line} between grounded {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} and floating {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} cannot be stable on a landward sloping bed. The limitation of the one-dimensional case disregards possible stabilizing effects of the ice shelves ({cite.13.'Dupont_and_Alley_2005}). Although it is clear that ice shelves that are laterally constrained by embayments inhibit ice flow into the ocean, the effect has not been quantified against the MISI. The same is true for other potentially stabilizing effects such as sedimentation near the grounding line ({cite.13.'Alley_et_al_2007}) or the influence of largescale bedrock roughness (i.e., topographic pinning points) on ice flow. Although these stabilizing effects need to be further investigated and quantified against the destabilizing effect of the MISI, no studies are available that would allow dismissing the MISI on theoretical grounds.

Although direct observations of ice dynamics are available, they are neither detailed enough nor cover a sufficiently long period to allow the monitoring of the temporal evolution of an MISI. Most Antarctic ice loss that has been detected during the satellite period has come from the WAIS ({cite.13.'Rignot_et_al_2008}; {cite.13.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}). Some studies have found an acceleration of ice loss ({cite.13.'Rignot_et_al_2011}) as well as enhanced basal ice-shelf melting ({cite.13.'Pritchard_et_al_2012}), but the short period of observations does not allow one to either dismiss or confirm that these changes are associated with destabilization of WAIS.

Paleo records suggest that WAIS may have deglaciated several times during warm periods of the last 5 million years, but they contain no information on rates ({cite.13.'Naish_et_al_2009}). Although coarse-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} models are in principle capable of modelling the MISI, there is medium confidence in their ability to simulate the correct {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} to external perturbations on decadal to centennial time scales ({cite.13.'Pattyn_et_al_2013}). One of these models ({cite.13.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}) reproduced paleo records of {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} with a forced ice-sheet model at 40 km resolution and parameterized ice flow across the grounding line according to {cite.13.'Schoof_2007a Schoof (2007a)}. These simulations showed a sea level rise of about 7 m over time spans of 1000 to 7000 years with approximately equal contributions from West and East Antarctica. However, no available model results or paleo records have indicated the possibility of self-accelerated ice discharge from these regions.

In summary, ice-dynamics theory, numerical simulations, and paleo records indicate that the existence of a marine-ice sheet instability associated with abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible in response to climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. However, theoretical considerations, current observations, numerical models, and paleo records currently do not allow a quantification of the timing of the onset of such an instability or of the magnitude of its multi-century contribution.
