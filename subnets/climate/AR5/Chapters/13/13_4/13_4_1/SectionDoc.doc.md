title: 13.4.1 - Ocean Heat Uptake and Thermal Expansion

More than 90% of the net energy increase of the climate system on multiannual time scales is stored in the ocean ({Box_3_1 Box 3.1}). GMSL rise due to {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} is approximately proportional to the increase in ocean heat content. The constant of proportionality is 0.11 ± 0.01 m per 1024 J for the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of CMIP5 models ({cite.13.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}); it depends on the vertical and latitudinal distribution of warming in the ocean, because the expansion of sea water per degree Celsius of warming is greater at higher temperature and higher pressure ({cite.13.'Russell_et_al_2000}; {cite.13.'Hallberg_et_al_2012}; Körper et al., 2013; {cite.13.'Perrette_et_al_2013}).

For the early decades of the 21st century, the upper ocean dominates the ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake}, and ocean heat content rises roughly linearly with global mean surface air temperature (SAT) change ({cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2011b}; Körper et al., 2013). On multi-decadal time scales under scenarios of steadily increasing {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}, the rate of increase of ocean heat content is approximately proportional to the global mean SAT change from equilibrium ({cite.13.'Gregory_2000}; {cite.13.'Meehl_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Rahmstorf_2007a}; {cite.13.'Gregory_and_Forster_2008}; {cite.13.'Katsman_et_al_2008}; {cite.13.'Schwartz_2012}), with the constant of proportionality (in W m–2 °C–1) being the ocean heat uptake efficiency k.

The ocean heat uptake efficiency quantifies the effect of ocean heat uptake on moderating time-dependent climate change; neglecting the small fraction of heat stored elsewhere in the climate system, the surface warming can be approximated as F/(α+k), where F is the RF and α is the climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} parameter ({cite.13.'Raper_et_al_2002}), and hence the rate of ocean heat uptake is approximately kF/(α+k). In CMIP3 and CMIP5, the {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of surface warming is dominated by the spread in F and α, but the spread in k accounts for a substantial part of the spread in projections of ocean heat uptake ({cite.13.'Dufresne_and_Bony_2008}; {cite.13.'Gregory_and_Forster_2008}; {cite.13.'Knutti_and_Tomassini_2008}; {cite.13.'Geoffroy_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Sriver_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Forster_et_al_2013}).

The spread in k relates to differences among models in heat-transport processes within the ocean. The warming spreads downwards from the surface over time, and the greatest increases in projected ocean heat content occur where the warming penetrates most deeply, in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic ({'Figure_12_12 Figure 12.12}; {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_7.12_4_7_1 Section 12.4.7.1}) ({cite.13.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}). Changes in {Glossary.*Convection convection} and the largescale vertical circulation are particularly important to heat uptake in the North Atlantic ({cite.13.'Banks_and_Gregory_2006}; {cite.13.'Rugenstein_et_al_2013}). Heat is also transported vertically by eddies, especially in the Southern Ocean, and by turbulent mixing. These processes are parameterized in models when they occur at unresolved scales. Observed ocean heat uptake has been used in conjunction with observed global SAT change to constrain the ocean effective thermal diffusivity representing all unresolved vertical transports in simple {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} and {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} ({cite.13.'Forest_et_al_2008}; {cite.13.'Knutti_and_Tomassini_2008}; Marčelja, 2010; {cite.13.'Sokolov_et_al_2010}). The simulated ocean vertical temperature profile and the depth of penetration of the warming in {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} have also been evaluated by comparison with observations, and both bear a relationship to k ({cite.13.'Hallberg_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}). Such comparisons suggest that model projections might be biased towards overestimating ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion for a given surface warming (Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_2 9.4.2.2}, {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_3 10.8.3} and {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_1.13_3_1_2 13.3.1.2}). The physical causes of this tendency are unclear. Although the simulated vertical temperature profile is affected by the model representation of vertical heat transport processes, {cite.13.'Brierley_et_al_2010 Brierley et al. (2010)} found only a small effect on k from variation of model parameters that influence interior heat transport.

Because the ocean integrates the surface heat flux, thermal expansion projections following different scenarios do not significantly diverge for several decades. {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} assuming strong {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} of GHG {Topics.*Emissions emissions} begin to show a reduced rate of thermal expansion beyond about 2040; the amount by 2100 is about one third less than in a non-mitigation scenario ({cite.13.'Washington_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2011b}; Körper et al., 2013), and half as much in {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} as in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} ({cite.13.'Yin_2012}) ({Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_1 Section 13.5.1}). The integrating effect means that thermal expansion depends not only on the cumulative total, but also on the pathway of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} emissions; reducing emissions earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise due to thermal expansion ({cite.13.'Zickfeld_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Bouttes_et_al_2013}). The integrating effect also means that annual time series of global ocean thermal expansion show less interannual variability than time series of global SAT. For the present assessment of GMSL rise, projections of ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion up to 2100 have been derived from the CMIP5 AOGCMs ({cite.13.'Yin_2012}). Methods are described in {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_1 Section 13.5.1} and the Supplementary Material and the results for ocean heat uptake are shown in {'Figure_13_8 Figure 13.8}, and for thermal expansion in {'Table_13_5 Table 13.5} and Figures {'Figure_13_10 13.10} and {'Figure_13_11 13.11}.

{Glossary.*Ocean_heat_uptake_efficiency Ocean heat uptake efficiency} is not constant on time scales of many decades or in scenarios of stable or decreasing RF ({cite.13.'Rahmstorf_2007a}; {cite.13.'Schewe_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Bouttes_et_al_2013}). A good representation of AOGCM behaviour is obtained by distinguishing a shallow layer, which is associated with {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} variations on decadal time scales, from a deep layer, which has the majority of the heat capacity ({cite.13.'Hansen_et_al_1985}; {cite.13.'Knutti_et_al_2008}; {cite.13.'Held_et_al_2010}; Olivié et al., 2012; {cite.13.'Schwartz_2012}; {cite.13.'Bouttes_et_al_2013}; {cite.13.'Geoffroy_et_al_2013}). Ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion take place not only while atmospheric GHG concentrations are rising, but continue for many centuries to millennia after stabilization of RF, at a rate which declines on a centennial time scale ({cite.13.'Stouffer_2004}; {cite.13.'Meehl_et_al_2005}; 2007; {cite.13.'Solomon_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Hansen_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Meehl_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Schwartz_2012}; {cite.13.'Bouttes_et_al_2013}; {cite.13.'Li_et_al_2013}; {cite.13.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}). This is because the time scale for warming the deep ocean is much longer than for the shallow ocean ({cite.13.'Gregory_2000}; {cite.13.'Held_et_al_2010}).

The rate and the stabilization time scale for thermal expansion depend on the GHG stabilization level. For the highest scenario (RCP8.5), GMSL rise due to thermal expansion can exceed 2 m above the pre-industrial level by the year 2500 ({Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_2 Section 12.5.2}, {'Figure_12_44 Figure 12.44}, {'Figure_13_14 Figure 13.14}a), and is still rising at that time. Changes in ocean circulation, particularly due to a reduction in deep water formation, can also have a large effect on global ocean heat uptake, and may relate nonlinearly to global surface warming ({cite.13.'Levermann_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Fluckiger_et_al_2006}; {cite.13.'Vellinga_and_Wood_2008}). As the rate of ocean heat uptake decreases, the surface warming approaches the level determined by the equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity}.

On a multi-millennial time scale, the range from {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Models of Intermediate Complexity suggests that thermal expansion contributes between 0.20 to 0.63 m per degree Celsius of global mean temperature increase ({cite.13.'Meehl_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Zickfeld_et_al_2013}) ({Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_2 Section 12.5.2} and {'Figure_13_14 Figure 13.14}a). The median of the six models of 0.42 m °C–1 is consistent with a thermal expansion of 0.38 m °C–1 that would result from a uniform increase in ocean temperature from the presently observed temperature and salinity distribution ({cite.13.'Levitus_et_al_2009}). {Topics.*Uncertainty Uncertainty} arises due to the different spatial distribution of the warming in models and the dependence of the expansion on local temperature and salinity.
