The 21st century sea level contribution from glaciers presented in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessment ranged from 0.06 to 0.15 m {Glossary.*Sea_level_equivalent SLE} by 2100 across a range of scenarios ({cite.13.'Meehl_et_al_2007}). The Randolph {Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} Inventory (RGI) ({cite.13.'Arendt_et_al_2012}) has improved {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of glacier contribution to sea level rise by providing the first globally complete accounting of glacier location, area, and area-elevation distribution ({Glossary.*Hypsometry hypsometry}). Several analyses of scenario-dependent SMB glacier projections (referred to here as process-based models) have been produced using the RGI, including {cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012a Marzeion et al. (2012a)}, {cite.13.'Giesen_and_Oerlemans_2013 Giesen and Oerlemans (2013)}, and Radić et al. (2013). The Marzieon and Radić approaches each used different suites of CMIP5 {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM} models to calculate SMB terms from RCP {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, and the model by Slangen and van de Wal (2011) was used to calculate SMB terms from RCP forcings (Supplementary Material 13.SM.1). {cite.13.'Giesen_and_Oerlemans_2013 Giesen and Oerlemans (2013)} used CRU forcing but calculated SMB from three different combinations of variations in modelled temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric transmissivity. Only their results for varying temperature are shown here. {cite.13.'Machguth_et_al_2013 Machguth et al. (2013)} is also included in {'Table_13_3 Table 13.3}, but this {Glossary.*Projection projection} represents changes in Greenland peripheral glaciers only, and is not included in the global glacier summaries. Although these details differ among the models, all share a generally common time-evolving structure, with SMB initially determined by model-generated climate forcing applied to a subset of global glaciers, the ensuing volume change converted to area change via volume-area scaling, and this result upscaled to a new global distribution and hypsometry to create initial conditions for the subsequent time step. These methods are described further in {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_1 Section 13.5.1} and in the Supplementary Material. Related results are shown in {'Table_13_5 Table 13.5} and Figures {'Figure_13_10 13.10} and {'Figure_13_11 13.11}.

Although the peripheral glaciers surrounding the ice sheets are included with the ice sheets in assessment of present-day changes ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}), future projections should ideally assess the peripheral glaciers separately, as these are too small and dynamically responsive to be modelled adequately with coarse-grid, non-dynamic ice-sheet SMB models. The peripheral glaciers surrounding both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are thus included in the process-based models described above, but for projections shown in {'Table_13_5 Table 13.5}, the Antarctic peripheral glaciers are included with the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} whereas the Greenland peripheral glaciers are included with the remaining world’s glaciers. Projected losses from glaciers peripheral to both ice sheets are listed separately in {'Table_13_3 Table 13.3}.

Several glacier loss projections derived from model types other than process-based models have been published since 2007; their projections range from 0.08 to 0.39 m SLE by 2100 ({'Table_13_3 Table 13.3}). These used methods of projecting future losses from glaciers developed in response to the absence of a global compilation of glacier observations after 2005 and the absence of a globally complete glacier inventory to provide geographic boundary conditions for conventional modelling. These methods include extrapolation from observed rates ({cite.13.'Meier_et_al_2007}), semi-empirical methods applied to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} components ({cite.13.'Jevrejeva_et_al_2012b}), kinematic (or ‘limit seeking’) projections ({cite.13.'Pfeffer_et_al_2008}), and power-law scaling estimates based on re-establishing equilibrium {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation}-area ratios (AARs) from initial non-equilibrium AARs ({cite.13.'Bahr_et_al_2009}). Strengths of these approaches include the fact that observations used to calibrate extrapolation and semi-empirical projection partially account for future dynamically forced losses, that semi-empirical methods use modelled future forcings as guidance for projections, and that AAR equilibration has strong physical and theoretical underpinnings and gives generalized but robust projections. These strengths partially offset the weaknesses of these models, which include, in the case of extrapolation and semi-empirical projection, an assumption of statistical stationarity that may not be valid, while the AAR equilibration approach gives only a final steady state value, so that rates or cumulative losses at any intermediate time must be estimated by area-{Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} scaling. However, these alternate methods are valuable because of their construction on fundamental and robust principles together with their use of the limited available information to produce projections that, although imprecise, are transparent, and require less detailed input information or knowledge of details of complex processes in comparison to process-based models.

Published results from process-based models are shown in {'Table_13_3 Table 13.3}. Glacier contributions at 2100, expressed as SLE, range between 0.04 and 0.11 m for Special Report on {Topics.*Emissions Emission} {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} (SRES) A1B, 0.07 and 0.17 m for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, between 0.07 and 0.20 m for RCP4.5, between 0.07 and 0.20 m for RCP6.0, and between 0.12 and 0.26 m for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}.

The projections derived from alternative models are also shown in {'Table_13_3 Table 13.3}; the mean and range of these models listed here is 0.24 [0.08 to 0.39] m SLE, consistent with the process-based models. Results from the process-based models, plotted as time series and grouped by forcing scenario, are shown in {'Figure_13_9 Figure 13.9}. See {'Table_13_3 Table 13.3} for specific start/ end dates for each projection.

Unresolved {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the projection of glacier contributions to sea level rise include the potential for near-term dynamic response from marine-terminating glaciers and interception of terrestrial {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}. Of the about 734,000 km2 of global glacier area exclusive of that peripheral to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, 280,500 km2 (38%) drains through marine-terminating outlets ({cite.13.'Gardner_et_al_2013}). Although the long-term potential for dynamic discharge from glaciers (as opposed to ice sheets) is limited by their small total volume, dynamic losses may be an important component of total sea level rise on the decade-to-century scale. In Alaska, Columbia Glacier lost 7.65 Gt yr–1 between 1996 and 2007, with 94% of that loss coming from rapid tidewater retreat ({cite.13.'Rasmussen_et_al_2011}); the loss from this single 1000 km2 glacier is 1.3% of the global cryospheric component of sea level rise during 1993–2010 ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}) and 0.7% of total sea level rise. The observations required to estimate the potential for similar dynamic response from other glacier regions do not exist at this time, but the dynamic contribution could be large on the century time scale. If the basin-wide thinning rate observed at Columbia Glacier over the past 25 years (about 5 m yr–1) were to occur over the area of global glaciers draining through marine outlets (280,500 km2) during the next 89 years (2011–2100), the sea level contribution would be approximately 30 cm SLE, compatible with Jeverajeva et al’s (2012b) projected loss of 26 cm SLE from glaciers. Although this is a rough calculation and an upper bound, because drainage through marine outlets does not guarantee tidewater instability, it indicates that the potential for a significant sea level response to dynamic retreat of glaciers cannot be rejected a priori.

Completion of the global glacier inventory has allowed large improvements in assessment and modelling, but further uncertainties related to the inventory remain to be resolved, including those arising from the size cutoff decided for the inventory (Bahr and Radić, 2012). Another {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty is interception of glacier runoff by land hydrology. Despite rapidly growing knowledge of changes in terrestrial water storage, especially through increased reliability of GRACE observations, glacier mass loss is still generally assumed to flow directly to the ocean, with no delay or interception by surface or aquifer storage. Although this probably will not apply to discharge from glaciers located near coasts (e.g., Canadian Arctic, Patagonia, Alaska, ice-sheet peripheries), runoff from interior regions (e.g., Alps, High Mountain Asia) may be significantly intercepted before reaching the ocean. Whether terrestrial interception has any significant effect on the net glacier contribution to sea level rise is undetermined at this time.
