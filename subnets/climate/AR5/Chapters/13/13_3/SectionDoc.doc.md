title: 13.3 - Contributions to Global Mean Sea Level Rise During the Instrumental Period

In order to assess our understanding of the causes of observed changes and our confidence in projecting future changes we compare observational estimates of contributions with results derived from {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM} experiments, beginning in the late 19th century, forced with estimated past time-dependent {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} changes in atmospheric composition and natural {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} due to volcanic aerosols and variations in solar irradiance ({Chapters.10.10_1 Section 10.1}). This period and these simulations are often referred to as “historical.”
