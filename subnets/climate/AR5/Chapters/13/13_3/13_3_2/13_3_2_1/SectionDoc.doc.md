‘Glaciers’ are defined here as all land-ice masses, including those peripheral to (but not including) the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The term ‘glaciers and ice caps’ was applied to this category in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Changes in aggregate {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} volume have conventionally been determined by various methods of repeat mapping of surface elevation to detect elevation (and thus volume) change. Mass changes are determined by compilation and upscaling of limited direct observations of surface mass balance (SMB). Since 2003, gravity observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have been used to detect mass change of the world’s glaciers.

The combined records indicate that a net decline of global glacier volume began in the 19th century, before significant {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} RF had started, and was probably the result of warming associated with the termination of the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age Little Ice Age} ({cite.13.'Crowley_2000}; {cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2006}, 2013b). Global rates of glacier volume loss did not increase significantly during much of the 20th century ({'Figure_4_12 Figure 4.12}). In part this may have been because of an enhanced rate of loss due to unforced high-latitude variability early in the century, while anthropogenic warming was still comparatively small ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_2.13_3_2_2 Section 13.3.2.2}). It is likely that {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} played a statistically significant role in acceleration of global glacier losses in the latter decades of the 20th century relative to rates in the 19th century ({Chapters.10.10_5.10_5_2.10_5_2_2 Section 10.5.2.2}). It is also likely that, during the 20th century, the progressive loss of glacier area significantly restricted the rate of mass loss ({cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013b}).

The earliest {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} assessments recognized that glaciers have been significant contributors to GMSL rise ({cite.13.'Meier_1984}). As assessed in {Chapters.4 Chapter 4}, observations, improved methods of analysis and a new, globally complete inventory indicate that glaciers, including those around the ice-sheet peripheries, very likely continue to be significant contributors to sea level, but are also highly variable on annual to decadal time scales. It is assumed that all glacier losses contribute to sea level rise, but the potential role of terrestrial interception of {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, either in lakes formed following future ice retreat or in groundwater, has yet to be evaluated. For the period 2003–2009, the sea level contribution of all glaciers globally, including those glaciers surrounding the periphery of the two ice sheets, is 0.71 [0.64 to 0.79] mm yr–1 sea level equivalent ({Glossary.*Sea_level_equivalent SLE}) ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3 Section 4.3.3}, {'Table_4_4 Table 4.4}). Depending on the method used, however, loss-rate measurements of the two ice sheets can be very difficult to separate from losses from the peripheral glaciers. To avoid double counting, total cryospheric losses are determined by adding estimates of glacier losses excluding the peripheral glaciers to losses from the ice sheets including their peripheral glaciers. The sea level contribution of all glaciers excluding those glaciers surrounding the periphery of the two ice sheets was 0.54 [0.47-0.61] mm yr-1 SLE for 1901-1990, 0.62 [0.25-0.99] mm yr-1 SLE for 1971-2009, 0.76 [0.391.13] mm yr-1 SLE for 1993-2009, and 0.83 [0.46-1.20] mm yr-1 SLE for 2005-2009 ({Chapters.4.4_3.4_3_3.4_3_3_4 Section 4.3.3.4}, {'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}).
