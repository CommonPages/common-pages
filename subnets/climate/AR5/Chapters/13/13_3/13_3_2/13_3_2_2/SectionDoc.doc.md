title: 13.3.2.2 - Modelled

Global {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} mass balance models are calibrated using data from the few well-observed glaciers. Approximately 100 glacier mass balance records are available in any given year over the past half-century; only 17 glaciers exist with records of 30 years or more ({cite.13.'Dyurgerov_and_Meier_2005}; {cite.13.'Kaser_et_al_2006}; {cite.13.'Cogley_2012}). Confidence in these models for {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of future change ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_2 Section 13.4.2}) depends on their ability to reproduce past observed glacier change using corresponding climate observations as the forcing ({cite.13.'Raper_and_Braithwaite_2005}; {cite.13.'Meier_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Bahr_et_al_2009}; Radić and Hock, 2011; {cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012b}; 2012a; {cite.13.'Giesen_and_Oerlemans_2013}). Model validation is challenging owing to the scarcity of independent observations (unused in model calibration), but {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} have been evaluated by methods such as cross validation of hindcast projections for individual glaciers drawn from the sample of glacier observations averaged for calibration ({cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012a}; Radić et al., 2013).

Confidence in the use of {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM} climate simulations as input to glacier projections is gained from the agreement since the mid-20th century of glacier models forced by AOGCM simulations with glacier models forced by observations ({cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012a}) ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}b). In the earlier 20th century, around the 1930s, glaciers at high northern latitudes lost mass at an enhanced rate ({cite.13.'Oerlemans_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Leclercq_et_al_2012}); in the model, observed {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} produced larger glacier losses than did AOGCM forcings ({cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012a}) ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}d). This is judged likely to be due to an episode of unforced, regionally variable warming around Greenland ({cite.13.'Box_2002}; {cite.13.'Chylek_et_al_2004}) rather than to RF of the climate system, and is consequently not reproduced by AOGCM experiments ({Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}). In our analysis of the budget of {Topics.*Sea_Level GMSL} rise ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_6 Section 13.3.6}), we take the difference between the simulations using AOGCM forcing and the simulation using observations as an estimate of the influence of unforced {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} on global glacier mass balance ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}b).

There is medium confidence in the use of glacier models to make global projections based on AOGCM results. The process-based understanding of glacier surface mass balance, the consistency of models and observations of glacier changes, and the evidence that AOGCM climate simulations can provide realistic input all give confidence, which on the other hand is limited because the set of well-observed glaciers is a very small fraction of the total.
