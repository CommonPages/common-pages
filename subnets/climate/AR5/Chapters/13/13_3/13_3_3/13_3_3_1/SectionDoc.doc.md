title: 13.3.3.1 - Observed Mass Balance

The Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet}’s mass balance is comprised of its surface mass balance and outflow, whereas Antarctica’s mass budget is dominated by {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} and outflow in the form of {Glossary.*Calving calving} and ice flow into floating (and therefore {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} neutral) ice shelves. Knowledge of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to observed sea level changes over the last two decades comes primarily from satellite and airborne surveys. Three main techniques are employed: the mass budget method, repeat {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry}, and gravimetric methods that measure temporal variations in the Earth’s gravity field ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2 Section 4.4.2}).

Observations indicate that the Greenland contribution to GMSL has very likely increased from 0.09 [–0.02 to 0.20] mm yr–1 for 1992–2001 to 0.59 [0.43 to 0.76] mm yr–1 for 2002–2011 ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_3 Section 4.4.3}, {'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}). The average rate of the Antarctica contribution to sea level rise likely increased from 0.08 [–0.10 to 0.27] mm yr–1 for 1992–2001 to 0.40 [0.20 to 0.61] mm yr–1 for 2002–2011 ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_3 Section 4.4.3}). For the budget period 1993–2010, the combined contribution of the ice sheets is 0.60 [0.42 to 0.78] mm yr–1. For comparison, the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}’s assessment for the period 1993–2003 was 0.21 ± 0.07 mm yr–1 for Greenland and 0.21 ± 0.35 mm yr–1 for Antarctica.
