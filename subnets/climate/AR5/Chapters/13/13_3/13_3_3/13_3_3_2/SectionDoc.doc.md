title: 13.3.3.2 - Modelled Surface Mass Balance

Projections of changes in the SMB of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are obtained from RCM or downscaled AOGCM simulations (Sections {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_1 13.4.3.1} and {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4.13_4_4_1 13.4.4.1}). A spatial {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of a few tens kilometres or finer is required in order to resolve the strong gradients in SMB across the steep slopes of the ice-sheet margins. Although simulations of SMB at particular locations may have errors of 5 to 20% compared with in situ observations, there is good agreement between methods involving {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} and observational methods of evaluating icesheet mass balance ({cite.13.'Shepherd_et_al_2012}). In the present climate, for both Greenland and Antarctica, the mean SMB over the ice-sheet area is positive, giving a negative number when expressed as {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} equivalent ({Glossary.*Sea_level_equivalent SLE}).

In Greenland, the average and standard deviation of {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} (precipitation minus sublimation) estimates for 1961–1990 is –1.62 ± 0.21 mm yr–1 SLE from the models in {'Table_13_2 Table 13.2}, agreeing with published observation-based accumulation maps, for example –1.42 ± 0.11 mm yr–1 SLE by {cite.13.'Bales_et_al_2009 Bales et al. (2009)} and –1.63 ± 0.23 mm yr–1 SLE by {cite.13.'Burgess_et_al_2010 Burgess et al. (2010)}. For SMB (accumulation minus {Glossary.*Runoff runoff}, neglecting drifting snow erosion, which is small), the models give –0.92 ± 0.26 mm yr–1 SLE for 1961–1990 ({'Table_13_2 Table 13.2}).

{table:'Table_13_2}

All of these models indicate that Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} SMB showed no significant {Glossary.*Trend trend} from the 1960s to the 1980s, then started becoming less positive (becoming less negative expressed as SLE) in the early 1990s, on average by 3% yr–1. This results in a statistically significant and increasing (i.e., becoming more positive) contribution to the rate of GMSL rise (SMB trend column of {'Table_13_2 Table 13.2}, {'Figure_13_5 Figure 13.5}). The largest trends are found in models with coupled snow and {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} simulations using the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model 2 (RACMO2) and the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR). Van den Broeke et al. (2009) concluded that the mass loss during 2000–2008 is equally split between SMB and dynamical change. {cite.13.'Rignot_et_al_2011 Rignot et al. (2011)} indicated that SMB change accounts for about 60% of the mass loss since 1992 and {cite.13.'Sasgen_et_al_2012 Sasgen et al. (2012)} showed that SMB change, simulated by RACMO2 ({cite.13.'Ettema_et_al_2009}, an earlier version of the model in {'Table_13_2 Table 13.2}), accounts for about 60% of the observed rate of mass loss during 2002–2010, with an observational estimate of the increase in ice outflow accounting for the remainder. This satisfactory consistency, within {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, in estimates for the Greenland ice-sheet mass budget gives confidence in SMB simulations of the past, and hence also in the similar models used for {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of SMB changes ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_1 Section 13.4.3.1}).

{image:'Figure_13_5}

This recent trend towards increasingly less positive SMB is caused almost entirely by increased melting and subsequent runoff, with variability in accumulation being comparatively small ({cite.13.'Sasgen_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Vernon_et_al_2013}). This tendency is related to pronounced regional warming, which may be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to some combination of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} climate change and anomalous regional variability in recent years ({cite.13.'Hanna_et_al_2008}; 2012; {cite.13.'Fettweis_et_al_2013}). Greenland SMB models forced by boundary conditions from AOGCM historical simulations ({cite.13.'Rae_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Fettweis_et_al_2013}) do not show statistically significant trends towards increasing contributions to GMSL, implying that the dominant contribution is internally generated {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} variability, which is not expected to be reproduced by AOGCM historical simulations ({Chapters.10.10_2 Section 10.2}). We have high confidence in projections of future warming in Greenland because of the agreement of models in predicting amplified warming at high northern latitudes (Sections {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_1 12.4.3.1} {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_2 14.8.2}) for well-understood physical reasons, although there remains uncertainty in the size of the amplification, and we have high confidence in projections of increasing surface melting ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_1 Section 13.4.3.1}) because of the sensitivity to warming demonstrated by SMB models of the past.

All Greenland SMB simulations for the first half of the 20th century depend on reconstructions of meteorological variability over the ice sheet made using empirical relationships based on observations from coastal stations and estimates of accumulation from ice cores. Despite the similar input data sets in all cases, the various climate {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} and SMB methods used have led to a range of results ({cite.13.'Fettweis_et_al_2008}; {cite.13.'Wake_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Hanna_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Box_2013}; {cite.13.'Box_and_Colgan_2013}; {cite.13.'Box_et_al_2013}; {cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013b}). For 1901–1990, {cite.13.'Hanna_et_al_2011 Hanna et al. (2011)} have a time-mean GMSL contribution of –0.3 mm yr–1, while {cite.13.'Box_and_Colgan_2013 Box and Colgan (2013)} have a weakly positive contribution and the others are about zero. In all cases, there is substantial variability associated with regional climate fluctuations, in particular the warm episode in the 1930s, during which glaciers retreated in southeastern Greenland ({cite.13.'Bjork_et_al_2012}). {cite.13.'Chylek_et_al_2004 Chylek et al. (2004)} argued that this episode was associated with the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} rather than with global climate change.

In Antarctica, accumulation (precipitation minus sublimation) approximates SMB because surface melting and runoff are negligible in the present climate ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2.4_4_2_1.4_4_2_1_1 Section 4.4.2.1.1}). There are uncertainties in modeland observation-based estimates of Antarctic SMB. Global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} do not account for snow hydrology or for drifting snow processes which remove an estimated 7% of the accumulated snow ({cite.13.'Lenaerts_et_al_2012}), and the ice sheet’s steep coastal slopes are not well captured by coarse-resolution models. Observation-based estimates rely on sparse accumulation measurements with very little coverage in high-accumulation areas. For the Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelves together, CMIP3 {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} simulate SMB for 1979–2000 of –7.1 ± 1.5 mm yr–1 SLE ({cite.13.'Connolley_and_Bracegirdle_2007}; {cite.13.'Uotila_et_al_2007}), the mean being about 10% larger in magnitude than observation-based estimates, for instance –6.3 mm yr–1 SLE from {cite.13.'Vaughan_et_al_1999 Vaughan et al. (1999)}. For the SMB of the grounded ice sheet alone, four global {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} models, with resolutions of 38 to 125 km ({cite.13.'Bromwich_et_al_2011}), give –5.2 ± 0.5 mm yr–1 SLE for 1979–2010, which compares well with an observational estimate of –4.9 ± 0.1 mm yr–1 SLE for 1950–2000 ({cite.13.'Arthern_et_al_2006}). Because of higher accumulation near the coast, the regional climate model RACMO2 gives the somewhat larger value of –5.5 ± 0.3 mm yr–1 SLE for 1979–2000 ({cite.13.'Lenaerts_et_al_2012}). This relatively good agreement, combined with the similarity of the geographical distribution of modelled and observed SMB, give medium confidence in the realism of the RCM SMB simulation.

Some global reanalyses have been shown to contain spurious trends in various quantities in the SH related to changes in the observing systems, for example, new satellite observations ({cite.13.'Bromwich_et_al_2007}; 2011). In the RCMs and in global reanalyses that are not affected by spurious trends, no significant trend is present in accumulation since 1980 ({Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2.4_4_2_3 Section 4.4.2.3}). This agrees with observation-based studies ({cite.13.'Monaghan_et_al_2006}; Anschütz et al., 2009) ({Chapters.4 Chapter 4}) and implies that Antarctic SMB change has not contributed significantly to recent changes in the rate of GMSL rise. Likewise, CMIP3 historical simulations do not exhibit any systematic trend in Antarctic precipitation during the late 20th century ({cite.13.'Uotila_et_al_2007}). No observational assessments have been made of variability in SMB for the whole ice sheet for the earlier part of the 20th century, or of its longer term mean.

General Circulation Model ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM}) and Regional Circulation Model (RCM) projections consistently indicate significant Antarctic warming and concomitant increase in precipitation. We have high confidence in expecting a relationship between these quantities on physical grounds ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4.13_4_4_1 Section 13.4.4.1}) and from {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} evidence (Van Ommen et al., 2004;

Lemieux-Dudon et al., 2010; {cite.13.'Stenni_et_al_2011}). The absence of a significant trend in Antarctic precipitation up to the present is not inconsistent with the expected relationship, because observed temperature trends over the majority of the continent are weak ({Chapters.10.10_5.10_5_2.10_5_2_1 Section 10.5.2.1}) and trends in Antarctic precipitation simulated for recent decades are much smaller than interannual variability (van den Broeke et al., 2006; {cite.13.'Uotila_et_al_2007}). Taking all these considerations together, we have medium confidence in model projections of a future Antarctic SMB increase, implying a negative contribution to GMSL rise (see also Sections {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4.13_4_4_1 13.4.4.1}, {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_3 13.5.3} and {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_15 14.8.15}).
