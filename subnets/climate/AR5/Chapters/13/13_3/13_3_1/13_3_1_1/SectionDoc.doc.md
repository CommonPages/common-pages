title: 13.3.1.1 - Observed

Important progress has been realized since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} in quantifying the observed {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} component of global mean {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise. This progress reflects (1) the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} of systematic time-dependent depth biases affecting historical expendable bathythermograph data ({cite.13.'Gouretski_and_Koltermann_2007}) ({Chapters.3 Chapter 3}), (2) the newly available Argo Project ocean (temperature and salinity) data with almost global coverage (not including ice-covered regions and marginal seas) of the oceans down to 2000 m since 2004–2005, and (3) estimates of the deep-ocean contribution using ship-based data collected during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and revisit cruises ({cite.13.'Johnson_and_Gruber_2007}; {cite.13.'Johnson_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Purkey_and_Johnson_2010}; {cite.13.'Kouketsu_et_al_2011}).

For the period 1971–2010, the rate for the 0 to 700 m depth range is 0.6 [0.4 to 0.8] mm yr–1 ({Chapters.3.3_7.3_7_2 Section 3.7.2} and {'Table_3_1 Table 3.1}). Including the deep-ocean contribution for the same period increases the value to 0.8 [0.5 to 1.1] mm yr–1 ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}). Over the {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} period (1993– 2010), the rate for the 0 to 700 m depth range is 0.8 [0.5 to 1.1] mm yr–1 and 1.1 [0.8 to 1.4] mm yr–1 when accounting for the deep ocean ({Chapters.3.3_7.3_7_2 Section 3.7.2}, {'Table_3_1 Table 3.1}, {'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}).
