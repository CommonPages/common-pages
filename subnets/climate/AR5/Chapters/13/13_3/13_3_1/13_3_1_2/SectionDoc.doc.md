GMSL rise due to {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} is approximately proportional to the increase in ocean heat content ({Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_1 Section 13.4.1}). Historical GMSL rise due to thermal expansion simulated by CMIP5 models is shown in {'Table_13_1 Table 13.1} and {'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}a. The {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} is due to uncertainty in RF and modelled {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} (Sections {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_2 8.5.2}, {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_2 9.4.2.2}, {Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_2.9_7_2_5 9.7.2.5} and {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_1 13.4.1}).

In the time mean of several decades, there is a negative volcanic forcing if there is more volcanic activity than is typical of the long term, and a positive forcing if there is less. In the decades after major volcanic eruptions, the rate of expansion is temporarily enhanced, as the ocean recovers from the cooling caused by the volcanic forcing ({cite.13.'Church_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2006}) ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}a). During 1961–1999, a period when there were several large volcanic eruptions, the CMIP3 simulations with both natural and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} have substantially smaller increasing trends in the upper 700 m than those with {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} forcing only ({cite.13.'Domingues_et_al_2008}) because the natural volcanic forcing tends to cool the climate system, thus reducing ocean heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} ({cite.13.'Levitus_et_al_2001}). The models including natural forcing are closer to observations, though with a tendency to underestimate the {Glossary.*Trend trend} by about 10% (Sections {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_2 9.4.2.2} and {Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_1 10.4.1}).

{cite.13.'Gregory_2010 Gregory (2010)} and {cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013a Gregory et al. (2013a)} proposed that {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} underestimate ocean heat uptake in their historical simulations because their control experiments usually omit volcanic forcing, so the imposition of historical volcanic forcing on the simulated climate system represents a time mean negative forcing relative to the control climate. The apparent long persistence of the simulated oceanic cooling following the 1883 eruption of Krakatau ({cite.13.'Delworth_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Gleckler_et_al_2006a}, 2006b; {cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2006}) is a consequence of this bias, which also causes a model-dependent underestimate of up to 0.2 mm yr–1 of thermal expansion on average during the 20th century ({cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013a}, 2013b). This implies that CMIP5 results may be similarly underestimated, depending on the details of the individual model control runs. {cite.13.'Church_et_al_2013 Church et al. (2013)} proposed a correction of 0.1 mm yr–1 to the model mean rate, which we apply in the {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} budget in {'Table_13_1 Table 13.1} and {'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}. The corrected CMIP5 model mean rate for 1971–2010 is close to the central observational estimate; the model mean rate for 1993–2010 exceeds the central observational estimate but they are not statistically different given the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1} and {'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}a). This correction is not made to {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of thermal expansion because it is very small compared with the projected increase in the rate ({Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_1 Section 13.5.1}).

In view of the improvement in observational estimates of thermal expansion, the good agreement of historical model results with observational estimates, and their consistency with understanding of the {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} and RF of the climate system ({Box_13_1 Box 13.1}), we have high confidence in the projections of thermal expansion using AOGCMs.
