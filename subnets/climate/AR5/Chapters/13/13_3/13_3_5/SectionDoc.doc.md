title: 13.3.5 - Ocean Mass Observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment

As discussed in {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}, it has been possible to directly estimate changes in ocean mass using satellite gravity data from GRACE since 2002 ({cite.13.'Chambers_et_al_2004}, 2010; {cite.13.'Chambers_2006}; {cite.13.'Cazenave_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Leuliette_and_Miller_2009}; {cite.13.'Llovel_et_al_2010}). These measurements represent the sum of total land ice plus land water components, and thus provide an independent assessment of these contributions. However, GRACE is also sensitive to mass redistribution associated with {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} and requires that this effect (on the order of –0.7 to –1.3 mm yr–1 when averaged over the ocean domain) ({cite.13.'Paulson_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Peltier_2009}; {cite.13.'Chambers_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Tamisiea_2011}) be removed before estimating the ocean-mass component. Most recent estimates ({cite.13.'Leuliette_and_Willis_2011}; von Schuckmann and Le Traon, 2011) report a global mean ocean mass increase of 1.8 [1.4 to 2.2] mm yr–1 over 2003–2012 after correcting for the GIA component. The associated error results from the low signal-to-noise ratio over the ocean domain and uncertainty in the model-based GIA correction ({cite.13.'Quinn_and_Ponte_2010}).

{Chapters.3 Chapter 3} notes that, in terms of global averages, the sum of the contribution to GMSL due to change in global ocean mass (the barystatic contribution), measured by GRACE, and the contribution due to global ocean {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} (the {Glossary.*Thermosteric thermosteric} contribution), measured by the Argo Project, agrees within {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} with the GMSL change observed by satellite {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} ({cite.13.'Leuliette_and_Willis_2011}; von Schuckmann and Le Traon, 2011), although there is still a missing contribution from expansion in the deep ocean below 2000 m. These data sets have allowed an investigation of the cause of variability in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} over the last few years ({'Figure_13_6 Figure 13.6}). In particular, {cite.13.'Boening_et_al_2012 Boening et al. (2012)} concluded that the decrease in GMSL over 2010–2011 followed by a rapid increase since 2011 was related to the 2011 {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña} event, whereby changes in land/ocean precipitation patterns caused a temporary increase in water storage on the land (and corresponding decrease in GMSL) during the La Niña event, especially in Australia, northern South America and southeast Asia ({cite.13.'Boening_et_al_2012}).
