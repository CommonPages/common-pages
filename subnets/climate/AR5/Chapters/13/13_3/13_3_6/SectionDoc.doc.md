title: 13.3.6 - Budget of Global Mean Sea Level Rise

Drawing on {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_1 Section 13.3.1} to 13.3.5, the budget of GMSL rise ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}, {'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}) is analysed using models and observations for the periods 1901–1990 (the 20th century, excluding the period after 1990 when ice-sheet contributions to GMSL rise have increased; Sections {Chapters.4.4_4 4.4} and {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_3.13_3_3_1 13.3.3.1}), since 1971 (when significantly more ocean data became available and systematic {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} reconstructions began), and since 1993 (when precise satellite sea level {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} began). The 2005–2010 period when Argo and GRACE data are available is short and strongly affected by interannual {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}, as discussed in the previous subsection ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_5 Section 13.3.5} and {'Figure_13_6 Figure 13.6}). Such variability is not externally forced and is therefore not expected to be reproduced in AOGCM historical experiments. For the contribution from {Glossary.*Land_water_storage land water storage} ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}c) we use the estimated effect of human intervention and neglect effects from climate-related variation, which are unimportant on multi-decadal time scales ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_4 Section 13.3.4}). Contributions due to {Glossary.*Runoff runoff} from thawed {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost}, change in atmospheric moisture content, and sedimentation in the ocean are not considered in the budget because they are negligible compared with observed GMSL rise and the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}.

For 1993–2010, allowing for uncertainties, the observed GMSL rise is consistent with the sum of the observationally estimated contributions (high confidence) ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}, {'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}e). The two largest terms are ocean {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} (accounting for about 35% of the observed GMSL rise) and glacier mass loss (accounting for a further 25%, not including that from Greenland and Antarctica). Observations indicate an increased ice-sheet contribution over the last two decades (Sections {Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2.4_4_2_2 4.4.2.2}, {Chapters.4.4_4.4_4_2.4_4_2_3 4.4.2.3} and {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_3.13_3_3_1 13.3.3.1}) ({cite.13.'Shepherd_et_al_2012}). The closure of the observational budget since 1993, within uncertainties, represents a significant advance since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} in physical understanding of the causes of past GMSL change, and provides an improved basis for critical evaluation of models of these contributions in order to assess their reliability for making {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}.

The observational budget cannot be rigorously assessed for 1901–1990 or 1971–2010 because there is insufficient observational information to estimate ice-sheet contributions with high confidence before the 1990s, and ocean data sampling is too sparse to permit an estimate of global mean thermal expansion before the 1970s. However, a closed observational GMSL budget since the 1970s can be demonstrated with reasonable estimates of ice-sheet contributions ({cite.13.'Church_et_al_2011a}; {cite.13.'Moore_et_al_2011}) ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}, {'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}). For 1971–2010, the observed contributions from thermal expansion and mass loss from glaciers (not including those in Antarctica) alone explain about 75% of the observed GMSL (high confidence).

AOGCM-based estimates of thermal expansion, which agree well with observations since 1971, observational estimates of the glacier contribution, and the estimated change in land water storage ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}c), which is relatively small, can all be made from the start of the 20th century (Sections {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_1.13_3_1_2 13.3.1.2}, {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_2.13_3_2_2 13.3.2.2} and {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_4 13.3.4}, {'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}). Model estimates of Greenland ice-sheet SMB changes give an uncertain but relatively small contribution during most of the 20th century, increasing since the early 1990s ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_3.13_3_3_2 Section 13.3.3.2}). There could be a small constant contribution from the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} ({cite.13.'Huybrechts_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013b}) due to long-term adjustment to climate change in previous millennia. Any secular rate of sea level rise in the late {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} was small (order of few tenths mm yr–1) ({Chapters.13.13_2.13_2_1.13_2_1_4 Section 13.2.1.4}), probably less than 0.2 mm yr–1 (see discussion in Gregory et al., (2013b). Including these ice-sheet contributions (but omitting Antarctic SMB variations, for which no observationally based information for the ice sheet as a whole is available for the majority of the 20th century), GMSL rise during the 20th century can be accounted for within uncertainties, including the observation that the linear {Glossary.*Trend trend} of GMSL rise during the last 50 years is little larger than for the 20th century, despite the increasing {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} ({cite.13.'Gregory_et_al_2013b}). Model-based {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution attribution} of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} to RFs is discussed in {Chapters.10.10_4.10_4_3 Section 10.4.3}.

The sum of CMIP5 AOGCM thermal expansion ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_1.13_3_1_2 Section 13.3.1.2}), glacier model results with CMIP5 AOGCM input (not including glaciers in Antarctica; {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_2.13_3_2_2 Section 13.3.2.2}; Marzeion et al., (2012a)), and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} intervention in land water storage ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_4 Section 13.3.4}) accounts for about 65% of the observed rate of GMSL rise for 1901–1990, and 90% for 1971–2010 and 1993–2010 (high confidence) ({'Table_13_1 Table 13.1}; {'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}). In all periods, the residual is small enough to be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the ice sheets ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_3.13_3_3_2 Section 13.3.3.2}).

The unusually warm conditions in the Arctic during the 1930s ({cite.13.'Chylek_et_al_2004}), which are attributed to unforced climate variability ({cite.13.'Delworth_and_Knutson_2000}) and are therefore not expected to be simulated by {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs}, likely produced a greater mass loss by glaciers in high northern latitudes ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_2.13_3_2_2 Section 13.3.2.2}). The difference between the glacier mass loss calculated with the {cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012a Marzeion et al. (2012a)} model when it is forced with observed climate rather than AOGCM simulated climate (the purple and blue curves in {'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}b) is an estimate of this effect.

If the glacier model results for observational input are used ({cite.13.'Marzeion_et_al_2012a Marzeion et al. (2012a)}, not including glaciers in Antarctica) and an illustrative value of 0.1 mm yr–1 is included for a long-term Antarctic contribution, the model mean is within 20% of the observed GMSL rise for the 20th century ({'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}a,c, dashed line), and 10% since 1993 ({'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}d, dashed line; {cite.13.'Church_et_al_2013 Church et al. (2013)}). When the observed icesheet contributions since 1992 are included as well, the sum is almost equivalent to the observed rise (dotted line in {'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}). Both observations and models have a maximum rate of rise in the 1930–1950 period, a minimum rate in the 1960s and a maximum rate over the last two decades ({'Figure_13_7 Figure 13.7}b). This agreement provides evidence that the larger rate of rise since 1990, with a significant component of ocean thermal expansion ({'Figure_13_4 Figure 13.4}d), results from increased RF (both natural and anthropogenic) and increased ice-sheet discharge, rather than a natural oscillation (medium confidence) ({cite.13.'Church_et_al_2013}).

In summary, the evidence now available gives a clearer account of observed GMSL change than in previous IPCC assessments, in two respects. First, reasonable agreement can be demonstrated throughout the period since 1900 between GMSL rise as observed and as calculated from the sum of contributions. From 1993, all contributions can be estimated from observations; for earlier periods, a combination of models and observations is needed. Second, when both models and observations are available, they are consistent within uncertainties. These two advances give confidence in the 21st century sea level projections. The ice-sheet contributions have the potential to increase substantially due to {Glossary.*Rapid_dynamical_change_of_glaciers_or_ice_sheets rapid dynamical change} (Sections {Chapters.13.13_1.13_1_4.13_1_4_1 13.1.4.1}, {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3.13_4_3_2 13.4.3.2} and {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4.13_4_4_2 13.4.4.2}) but have been relatively small up to the present (Sections {Chapters.4.4_4 4.4} and {Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_3.13_3_3_2 13.3.3.2}). Therefore, the closure of the sea level budget to date does not test the reliability of ice-sheet models in projecting future rapid dynamical change; we have only medium confidence in these models, on the basis of theoretical and empirical understanding of the relevant processes and observations of changes up to the present (13.4.3.2, 13.4.4.2).
