title: 13.5 - Projections of Global Mean Sea Level Rise

Process-based {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} for {Topics.*Sea_Level GMSL} rise during the 21st century, given in {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_1 Section 13.5.1}, are the sum of contributions derived from models that were evaluated by comparison with observations in {Chapters.13.13_3 Section 13.3} and used to project the contributions in {Chapters.13.13_4 Section 13.4}. Projections of GMSL rise by semi-empirical models (SEMs) are given in {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_2 Section 13.5.2}. We compare these two and other approaches in {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_3 Section 13.5.3} and assess the level of confidence that we can place in each approach. Longer term projections are discussed in {Chapters.13.13_5.13_5_4 Section 13.5.4}.
