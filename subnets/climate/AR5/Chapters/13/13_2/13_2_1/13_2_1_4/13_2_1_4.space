  |RSL records indicate that from ~7 to 3 thousand years ago, GMSL likely rose 2 to 3 m to near present-day levels. Based on local {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} records spanning the last 2000 years, there is medium confidence that fluctuations in GMSL during this interval have not exceeded ~ Â±0.25 m on time scales of a few hundred years.
