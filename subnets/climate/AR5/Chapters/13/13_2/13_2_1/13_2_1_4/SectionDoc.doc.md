title: 13.2.1.4 - The Late Holocene

Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, there has been significant progress in resolving the {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} history of the last 7000 years. RSL records indicate that from ~7 to 3 ka, GMSL likely rose 2 to 3 m to near present-day levels ({Chapters.5 Chapter 5}). Based on local sea level records spanning the last 2000 years, there is medium confidence that fluctuations in GMSL during this interval have not exceeded ~ ±0.25 m on time scales of a few hundred years ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_3 Section 5.6.3}, {'Figure_13_3 Figure 13.3}a). The most robust signal captured in salt marsh records from both Northern and Southern Hemispheres supports the AR4 conclusion for a transition from relatively low rates of change during the late {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} (order tenths of mm yr–1) to modern rates (order mm yr–1) ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_3 Section 5.6.3}, {'Figure_13_3 Figure 13.3}b). However, there is variability in the magnitude and the timing (1840–1920) of this increase in both paleo and instrumental ({Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge}) records ({Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7}). By combining paleo sea level records with tide gauge records at the same localities, {cite.13.'Gehrels_and_Woodworth_2013 Gehrels and Woodworth (2013)} concluded that sea level began to rise above the late Holocene background rate between 1905 and 1945, consistent with the conclusions by {cite.13.'Lambeck_et_al_2004 Lambeck et al. (2004)}.
