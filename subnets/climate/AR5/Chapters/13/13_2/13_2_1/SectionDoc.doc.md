title: 13.2.1 - The Geological Record

Records of past {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} provide insight into the sensitivity of sea level to {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} change as well as context for understanding current changes and evaluating {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} changes. Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, important progress has been made in understanding the amplitude and variability of sea level during past intervals when climate was warmer than pre-industrial, largely through better accounting of the effects of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} on coastal sequences ({cite.13.'Kopp_et_al_2009}, 2013; {cite.13.'Raymo_et_al_2011}; {cite.13.'Dutton_and_Lambeck_2012}; {cite.13.'Lambeck_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Raymo_and_Mitrovica_2012}) ({Chapters.5 Chapter 5}). Here we summarize the constraints provided by the record of past sea level variations during times when global temperature was similar to or warmer than today.
