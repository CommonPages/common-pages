title: 13.2.1.1 - The Middle Pliocene

There is medium confidence that during the warm intervals of the middle {Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} (3.3 to 3.0 Ma), global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} were 2°C to 3.5°C warmer than for pre-industrial climate ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 Section 5.3.1}). There are {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence} that {Topics.*Sea_Level GMSL} during these middle Pliocene warm periods was higher than today, but low agreement on how high it reached ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 Section 5.6.1}). The most robust lines of evidence come from proximal sedimentary records that suggest periodic {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} of the West Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} (WAIS) and parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) ({cite.13.'Naish_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Passchier_2011}) and from ice-sheet models that suggest near-complete deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, WAIS and partial deglaciation of the EAIS ({cite.13.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}; {cite.13.'Hill_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Dolan_et_al_2011}). The assessment by {Chapters.5 Chapter 5} suggests that GMSL was above present, but that it did not exceed 20 m above present, during the middle Pliocene warm periods (high confidence).
