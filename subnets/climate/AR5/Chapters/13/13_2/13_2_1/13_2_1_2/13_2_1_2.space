section 13_2_1_2

  |During marine isotope stage 11 (MIS 11; 401 to 411 thousand years ago), Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} and tropical Pacific paleo temperature estimates suggest that global temperature was 1.5°C to 2.0°C warmer than pre-industrial. Our assessment is that MIS 11 {Topics.*Sea_Level GMSL} reached 6 to 15 m higher than present.
