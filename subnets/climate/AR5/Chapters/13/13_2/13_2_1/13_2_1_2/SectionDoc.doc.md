title: 13.2.1.2 - Marine Isotope Stage 11

During marine isotope stage 11 (MIS 11; 401 to 411 ka), Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} and tropical Pacific paleo temperature estimates suggest that global temperature was 1.5°C to 2.0°C warmer than pre-industrial (low confidence) (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010). Studies of the magnitude of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} highstands from raised shorelines {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to MIS 11 have generated highly divergent estimates. Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, studies have accounted for {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} effects ({cite.13.'Raymo_and_Mitrovica_2012}) or reported elevations from sites where the GIA effects are estimated to be small ({cite.13.'Muhs_et_al_2012}; {cite.13.'Roberts_et_al_2012}). From this evidence, our assessment is that MIS 11 GMSL reached 6 to 15 m higher than present (medium confidence), requiring a loss of most or all of the present Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} and WAIS plus a reduction in the EAIS of up to 5 m equivalent sea level if sea level rise was at the higher end of the range.
