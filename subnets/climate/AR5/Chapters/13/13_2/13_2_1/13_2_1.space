  |Records of past {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} provide insight into the sensitivity of sea level to {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} change as well as context for understanding current changes and evaluating {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} changes. RSL records indicate that from ~7 to 3 thousand years ago, GMSL likely rose 2 to 3 m to near present-day levels. Based on local sea level records spanning the last 2000 years, there is medium confidence that fluctuations in GMSL during this interval have not exceeded ~ Â±0.25 m on time scales of a few hundred years.
