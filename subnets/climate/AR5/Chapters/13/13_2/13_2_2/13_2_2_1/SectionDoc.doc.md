title: 13.2.2.1 - The Tide Gauge Record (~1700–2012)

The number of tide gauges has increased since the first gauges at some northern European ports were installed in the 18th century; Southern Hemisphere (SH) measurements started only in the late 19th century. {Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7} assesses 20th century sea level rise estimates from tide gauges ({cite.13.'Douglas_2001}; {cite.13.'Church_and_White_2006}, 2011; {cite.13.'Jevrejeva_et_al_2006}, 2008; {cite.13.'Holgate_2007}; {cite.13.'Ray_and_Douglas_2011}), and concludes that even though different strategies were developed to account for inhomogeneous {Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge} data coverage in space and time, and to correct for vertical crustal motions (also sensed by tide gauges, in addition to {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} and variability), it is very likely that the long-term {Glossary.*Trend trend} estimate in GMSL is 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm yr–1 between 1901 and 2010 for a total sea level rise of 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m ({'Figure_13_3 Figure 13.3}c). Interannual and decadal-scale variability is superimposed on the long-term MSL trend, and {Chapters.3 Chapter 3} noted that discrepancies between the various published MSL records are present at these shorter time scales.

{Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7} also concludes that it is likely that the rate of sea level rise increased from the 19th century to the 20th century. Taking this evidence in conjunction with the {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} evidence for a change of rate (Sections {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_3 5.6.3} and {Chapters.13.13_2.13_2_1 13.2.1}; {'Figure_13_3 Figure 13.3}b), there is high confidence that the rate of sea level rise has increased during the last two centuries, and it is likely that GMSL has accelerated since the early 1900’s. Because of the presence of low-frequency variations (e.g., multi-decadal variations seen in some tide gauge records; {cite.13.'Chambers_et_al_2012 Chambers et al. (2012)}), sea level acceleration results are sensitive to the choice of the analysis time span. When a 60-year oscillation is modelled along with an acceleration term, the estimated acceleration in GMSL (twice the quadratic term) computed over 1900–2010 ranges from 0.000 [–0.002 to 0.002] mm yr–2 in the {cite.13.'Ray_and_Douglas_2011 Ray and Douglas (2011)} record, to 0.013 [0.007 to 0.019] mm yr–2 in the {cite.13.'Jevrejeva_et_al_2008 Jevrejeva et al. (2008)} record, and 0.012 [0.009 to 0.015] mm yr–2 in the {cite.13.'Church_and_White_2011 Church and White (2011)} record. For comparison, {cite.13.'Church_and_White_2011 Church and White (2011)} estimated the acceleration term to be 0.009 [0.004 to 0.014] mm yr–2 over the 1880–2009 time span when the 60-year cycle is not considered.
