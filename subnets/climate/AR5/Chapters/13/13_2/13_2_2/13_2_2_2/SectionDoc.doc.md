title: 13.2.2.2 - The Satellite Altimeter Record (1993–2012)

The high-precision satellite {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} record started in 1992 and provides nearly global (±66°) {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} measurements at 10-day intervals. {cite.13.'Ollivier_et_al_2012 Ollivier et al. (2012)} showed that Envisat, which observes to ±82° latitude, provides comparable GMSL estimates. Although there are slight differences at interannual time scales in the altimetry-based GMSL time series produced by different groups ({cite.13.'Masters_et_al_2012}), there is very good agreement on the 20-year long GMSL {Glossary.*Trend trend} ({'Figure_13_3 Figure 13.3}d). After accounting for the ~ –0.3 mm yr–1 correction related to the increasing size of the global ocean basins due to {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} ({cite.13.'Peltier_2009}), a GMSL rate of 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm yr–1 over 1993–2012 is found by the different altimetry data processing groups. The current level of precision is derived from assessments of all {Glossary.*Source source} of errors affecting the altimetric measurements ({cite.13.'Ablain_et_al_2009}) and from {Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge} comparisons ({cite.13.'Beckley_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Nerem_et_al_2010}). {Chapters.3 Chapter 3} concludes that the GMSL trend since 1993 is very likely higher compared to the mean rates over the 20th century, and that it is likely that GMSL rose between 1920 and 1950 at a rate comparable to that observed since 1993. This recent higher rate is also seen in tide gauge data over the same period, but on the basis of observations alone it does not necessarily reflect a recent acceleration, considering the previously reported multi-decadal variations of {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level}. The rapid increase in GMSL since 2011 is related to the recovery from the 2011 {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña} event ({Chapters.13.13_3.13_3_5 Section 13.3.5}) ({cite.13.'Boening_et_al_2012}).
