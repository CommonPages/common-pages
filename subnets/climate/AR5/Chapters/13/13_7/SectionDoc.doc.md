title: 13.7 - Projections of 21st Century Sea Level Extremes and Waves

Climate change will affect sea levels extremes and ocean waves in two principal ways. First, because extratropical and tropical storms are one of the key drivers of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} extremes and waves, future changes in intensity, frequency, duration, and path of these storms will impact them. Second, sea level rise adds to the heights of sea level extremes, regardless of any changes in the storm-related component. MSL change may also accentuate the threat of coastal inundation due to changes in wave runup. Observations of changes in sea level extremes and waves are discussed in {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}. Sea level extremes at the coast occur mainly in the form of storm surges and tsunamis, but because the latter are not climate driven, we assess only {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} for sea level extremes based on estimates of future storminess and MSL change.
