title: 13.7.1 - Observed Changes in Sea Level Extremes

As discussed in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.13.'Bindoff_et_al_2007}) and confirmed by more recent studies (MeneÃÅndez and Woodworth, 2010), statistical analyses of tide-gauge observations have shown an increase in observed {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} extremes worldwide that are caused primarily by an increase in MSL ({Chapters.3 Chapter 3}). Dominant modes of climate variability, particularly {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, also have a measureable influence on sea level extremes in many regions ({cite.13.'Lowe_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Walsh_et_al_2011}). These impacts are due to sea level anomalies associated with {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate modes}, as well as mode-related changes in storminess. There has been some indication that the amplitude and phase of major tidal constituents have exhibited long-term change ({cite.13.'Jay_2009}; {cite.13.'Muller_et_al_2011}), but their impacts on {Glossary.*Extreme_sea_level extreme sea level} are not well understood. Using particle size analysis of cores collected in the Mackenzie Delta in the Arctic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, {cite.13.'Vermaire_et_al_2013 Vermaire et al. (2013)} inferred increased {Glossary.*Storm_surge storm surge} activity in the region during the last approximately 150 years, which they related to the annual mean temperature anomaly in the NH and a decrease in summer sea-ice extent.
