title: 13.7.2.1 - Recent Assessments of Projections of Sea Level Extremes

The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessed {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of storm surges for a few regions (Europe, Australia, the Bay of Bengal) based on a limited number of dynamical modelling studies ({cite.13.'Christensen_et_al_2007}). Although these results generally indicated higher magnitude surges in future {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, there was low confidence in these projections because of the wide spread in underlying {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM} and {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCM} projections.

Studies since the AR4 have further assessed the relative contributions of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise and storminess on projected sea level extremes. {cite.13.'Lowe_et_al_2010 Lowe et al. (2010)} concluded that the increases in the observed sea level extremes in the 20th century occurred primarily through an increase in MSL, and that the same applies to projections for the 21st century. The IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) assessment concluded that it is very likely that MSL rise will contribute to an increase in future sea level extremes ({cite.13.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). It noted that changes in storminess may also affect sea level extremes but the limited geographical coverage of studies and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} associated with storminess changes prevent a general assessment. The global tropical cyclone frequency will likely decrease or remain roughly constant, but it is more likely than not that the frequency of the most intense storms will increase in some ocean basins ({Chapters.14 Chapter 14}). Uncertainties in projections of cyclone frequency and tracks make it difficult to project how these changes will impact particular regions. Similarly, while the SREX and the current assessment ({Chapters.14 Chapter 14}) find that it is likely that there has been a poleward shift in the main northern and southern extra-tropical cyclone tracks during the last 50 years, and that regional changes may be substantial, there is only low confidence in {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}-specific projections.
