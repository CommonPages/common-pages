title: 13.6.4.1 - Dynamic Ocean Response to Cryospheric Freshwater Forcing

The addition of freshwater from glaciers and ice sheets to the ocean leads to an instantaneous increase in global mean {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level}, but because it is communicated around the ocean basins via a dynamical adjustment, it is not instantaneously globally uniform ({cite.13.'Kawase_1987}; {cite.13.'Cane_1989}). For the addition of mass, the barotropic adjustment of the ocean takes place in a few days ({cite.13.'Gower_2010}; {cite.13.'Lorbacher_et_al_2012}). The addition of freshwater to the ocean from melting of the Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} results in an additional basin-wide {Glossary.*Steric steric} response of the North Atlantic within months and is communicated to the global ocean via boundary waves, equatorial Kelvin waves, and westward propagating baroclinic Rossby waves on decadal time scales ({cite.13.'Stammer_2008}). A similar response but with a different pattern can be observed from Antarctic meltwater input. In both cases, an associated complete baroclinic adjustment of the global ocean might take as long as several centuries. The adjustment of the ocean to high-latitude meltwater input also involves atmospheric teleconnections; such a response to Greenland meltwater pulses could lead to sea level changes in the Pacific within months ({cite.13.'Stammer_et_al_2011}). On longer-than-decadal time scales, the freshwater input to the North Atlantic raises sea level in the Arctic Ocean and leads to an anomalous southward Bering Strait throughflow, transporting colder, fresher water from the Arctic Ocean into the North Pacific ({cite.13.'Hu_et_al_2010}) and causing North Pacific cooling ({cite.13.'Okumura_et_al_2009}). Meltwater {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} in the subpolar North Atlantic also causes changes of the AMOC ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_7.12_4_7_2 Section 12.4.7.2}), which in turn causes dynamical changes of sea level in the North Atlantic, particularly in its northwestern {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.13.'Lorbacher_et_al_2010}). The combination of this dynamic sea level rise and the global {Glossary.*Mean_sea_level mean sea level} rise makes the northeastern North American coast vulnerable to some of the fastest and largest sea level rises during this century ({cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2009}).
