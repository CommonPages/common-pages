title: 13.6.4 - Response to Freshwater Forcing

Enhanced freshwater fluxes derived from an increase in ice-sheet meltwater at high latitudes results in a regional pattern of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rise originating from adjustments in ocean dynamics and in the solid earth. Neither effect is included in CMIP5 models, although the latter adjustment is computed off line here.
