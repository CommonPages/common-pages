title: 13.6.4.2 - Earth and Gravitational Response to Contemporary Surface Water Mass Redistribution

Deformational, rotational and gravitational responses to mass redistribution between the {Topics.*Climate_System cryosphere}, the land and the oceans produce distinctive regional departures from GMSL, referred to as sea level fingerprints ({cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2001}, 2009; {cite.13.'Gomez_et_al_2010a}; {cite.13.'Riva_et_al_2010}) ({Chapters.13.13_1 Section 13.1}, {FAQ_13_1 FAQ 13.1}). Many existing studies of these effects have not defined a specific rate of ice-sheet mass loss ({cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2001}) or are based on end-member {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} of ice retreat, such as from the WAIS ({cite.13.'Bamber_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2009}; {cite.13.'Gomez_et_al_2010a}) and marine-based parts of the East Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} ({cite.13.'Gomez_et_al_2010a}). {cite.13.'Bamber_and_Riva_2010 Bamber and Riva (2010)} calculated the sea level {Glossary.*Fingerprint fingerprint} of all contemporary land-ice melt and each of its major components. {cite.13.'Spada_et_al_2013 Spada et al. (2013)} examined the regional sea level pattern from future ice melt based on the A1B scenario.

As can be seen from {'Figure_13_18 Figure 13.18}, a characteristic of the sea level fingerprints is that regions adjacent to the {Glossary.*Source source} of the mass loss are subject to relative sea level fall of about an order of magnitude greater than the equivalent GMSL rise from these mass contributions, whereas in the far field the sea level rise is larger (up to about 30%) than the global average rise ({cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2001}, 2009; {cite.13.'Gomez_et_al_2010a}). {cite.13.'Gomez_et_al_2010a Gomez et al. (2010a)} and {cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2011 Mitrovica et al. (2011)} showed that differences in the maximum {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} rise (relative to the global mean) between published results is due to the accuracy with which water expulsion from the deglaciated marine basins is calculated. These changes are in addition to the ongoing response to past changes (e.g., glacial {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} adjustment in response to the last {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation}). {cite.13.'Mitrovica_et_al_2001 Mitrovica et al. (2001)} suggested that the lower rates of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} inferred from {Glossary.*Tide_gauge tide gauge} records at European sites relative to the global average were consistent with 20th century melting from Greenland. Similarly, {cite.13.'Gehrels_and_Woodworth_2013 Gehrels and Woodworth (2013)} suggested that the larger magnitude of the early 20th century sea level acceleration observed in Australia and New Zealand, as compared with the North Atlantic, may represent a fingerprint of the increased melt contributions of Greenland and Arctic glaciers in the 1930s. Nevertheless, current rates of ice-sheet melting are difficult to distinguish from dynamic variability ({cite.13.'Kopp_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Hay_et_al_2013}), but it is likely that with further ice-sheet melting they will begin to dominate the regional patterns of {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} toward the end of the 21st century, especially under climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} conditions for which ice-sheet melting contributes more than 20-cm equivalent sea level rise ({cite.13.'Kopp_et_al_2010}). These changes are in addition to the ongoing response to past changes (e.g., {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} in response to the last deglaciation; {'Figure_13_18 Figure 13.18}a).

{Glossary.*Water_mass Water mass} redistributions associated with land hydrology changes other than those from land ice may also produce spatially variable fingerprints in sea level ({cite.13.'Fiedler_and_Conrad_2010}). In particular, regional changes in the terrestrial storage of water can lead to a sea level response on interannual and longer time scales, specifically near large river basins ({cite.13.'Riva_et_al_2010}).
