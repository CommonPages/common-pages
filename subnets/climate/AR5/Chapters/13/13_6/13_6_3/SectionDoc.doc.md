title: 13.6.3 - Response to Atmospheric Pressure Changes

Regional {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} also adjusts to regional changes in atmospheric sea level pressure relative to its instantaneous mean over the ocean. Over time scales longer than a few days, the adjustment is nearly {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic}. Sea level pressure is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} to increase over the subtropics and mid-latitudes (depressing sea level) and decrease over high latitudes (raising sea level), especially over the Arctic (order several millibars), by the end of the 21st century associated with a poleward expansion of the {Glossary.*Hadley_Circulation Hadley Circulation} and a poleward shift of the {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} of several degrees latitude ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4 Section 12.4.4}) ({cite.13.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). These changes may therefore contribute positively to the sea level rise in the Arctic in the range of up to 1.5 cm and about 2.5 cm for RCP4.5 and {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}, respectively ({cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2010}) ({'Figure_13_17 Figure 13.17}). In contrast, air pressure changes oppose sea level rise in midand low latitudes albeit with small amplitudes. Air pressure may also influence regional sea level elsewhere, as demonstrated by sea level changes in the Mediterranean in the second half of the 20th century ({cite.13.'Tsimplis_et_al_2005}).
