title: 13.6 - Regional Sea Level Changes

Regional {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} changes may differ substantially from a global average, showing complex spatial patterns which result from ocean dynamical processes, movements of the sea floor, and changes in gravity due to {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} redistribution (land ice and other terrestrial water storage) in the climate system. The regional distribution is associated with natural or {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate modes} rather than factors causing changes in the global average value, and include such processes as a dynamical redistribution of water masses and a change of water mass properties caused by changes in winds and air pressure, airâ€“sea heat and freshwater fluxes and ocean currents. Because the characteristic time scales of all involved processes are different, their relative contribution to net regional sea level variability or change will depend fundamentally on the time scale considered.
