title: 13.6.2 - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 General Circulation Model Projections on Decadal to Centennial Time Scales

CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of regional sea level provide information primarily about dynamical sea level changes resulting from increased heat {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} and changes in the wind {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. On decadal time scales, the CMIP5 model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} identifies strong interannual variability (up to 8 cm, root-mean square (RMS)) associated with {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and dynamics of the equatorial current system in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans ({'Figure_13_15 Figure 13.15}a). Similar variability in the amplitude of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} but due to other {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate modes} is also apparent in the North Atlantic Current and in parts of the Southern Ocean.

Toward the end of the 21st century, the CMIP5 results indicate that it is possible that the interannual to decadal variability of dynamic sea level can weaken in some parts of the world ocean, for example, the western low-latitude Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean, whereas it could be amplified in other parts, for example, the North Pacific, the eastern tropical Pacific, the eastern subtropical Atlantic and the Arctic ({'Figure_13_15 Figure 13.15}b).

Longer-than-decadal-time-scale regional sea level changes can increasingly be expected to result from long-term changes in the wind field, changes in the regional and global ocean heat and freshwater content and the associated dynamical adjustment (with associated redistribution of ocean properties), and (to a lesser extent) from atmospheric pressure. The CMIP5 projections of {Glossary.*Steric steric} sea level changes toward the end of the 21st century reveal a clear regional pattern in dynamical {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} ({'Figure_13_16 Figure 13.16}), in which the Southern Ocean shows a net decline relative to the global mean, while the remaining global ocean displays complex ridge-and-trough structures superimposed on a generally rising sea level ({cite.13.'Yin_2012}). For example, in the North Atlantic, the largest sea level rise is along and north of the North Atlantic Current, but less so further to the south in the center of the warmer subtropical {Glossary.*Gyre gyre}. A similar dipole pattern was observed in CMIP3 results there due to a weakening of the AMOC which leads to a local steric sea level rise east of North America, resulting in more water on the shelf and directly impacting northeastern North America ({cite.13.'Levermann_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Landerer_et_al_2007}; {cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2010}). A similar pattern can be observed in the North Pacific, but here and in other parts of the world ocean (e.g., Southern Ocean), regional sea level patterns are largely the result of changes in wind forcing, associated changes in the circulation, and an associated redistribution of heat and freshwater. Some regional changes can also be expected to result from modifications in the expansion coefficient due to changes in the oceanâ€™s regional heat content ({cite.13.'Kuhlbrodt_and_Gregory_2012}).

The CMIP5 ensemble indicates that regions showing an enhanced sea level toward the end of the 21st century coincide with those showing the largest {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} ({'Figure_13_16 Figure 13.16}b). Although this also appeared in the earlier CMIP3 SRES A1B results, the CMIP5 results, by comparison, show a general reduction in the ensemble spread, especially in high latitudes. On a global average, this reduction is from 5.7 cm to 2.1 cm, RMS.

The contribution of changes of global ocean heat storage to regional steric sea level anomalies is virtually certain to increase with time as the climate warming signal increasingly penetrates into the deep ocean ({cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2011a}). For the last three decades of the 21st century, the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} ensemble mean shows a significant heat storage increase ({cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2010}), about half of which is stored in the ocean below 700 m depth. Recent {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} of ongoing changes in the ocean salinity structure ({cite.13.'Durack_and_Wijffels_2010}) ({Chapters.3.3_3.3_3_2 Section 3.3.2}) may also contribute to future regional steric sea level changes. {Glossary.*Halosteric Halosteric} effects can dominate in some regions, especially in regions of highlatitude {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} formation where long-term heat and freshwater changes are expected to occur (e.g., in the subpolar North Atlantic, the Arctic, the Southern Ocean) ({cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2011a}). Because of an anticipated increase in atmospheric moisture transport from low to high latitudes ({cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2003}), halosteric anomalies are positive in the Arctic Ocean and dominate regional sea level anomalies there ({cite.13.'Yin_et_al_2010}). It is likely that future {Glossary.*Thermosteric thermosteric} changes will dominate the steric variations in the Southern Ocean, and strong compensation between thermosteric and halosteric change will characterize the Atlantic ({cite.13.'Pardaens_et_al_2011a}).
