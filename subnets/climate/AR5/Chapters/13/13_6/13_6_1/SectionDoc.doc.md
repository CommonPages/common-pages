title: 13.6.1 - Regional Sea Level Changes, Climate Modes and Forced Sea Level Response

As discussed in {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}, most of the regional {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} changes observed during the recent {Glossary.*Altimetry altimetry} era or reconstructed during past decades from tide gauges appear to be {Glossary.*Steric steric} ({cite.13.'Levitus_et_al_2005}, 2009; {cite.13.'Lombard_et_al_2005a}, 2005b; {cite.13.'Ishii_and_Kimoto_2009}; {cite.13.'Stammer_et_al_2013}). Moreover, steric changes observed during the altimetry era appear to be primarily {Glossary.*Thermosteric thermosteric} in nature, although {Glossary.*Halosteric halosteric} effects, which can reduce or enhance thermosteric changes, are also important in some regions (e.g., Atlantic Ocean, Bay of Bengal). Ocean models and ocean {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis}-based results ({cite.13.'Carton_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Wunsch_and_Heimbach_2007}; {cite.13.'Stammer_et_al_2011}) as well as ocean circulation models without data assimilation ({cite.13.'Lombard_et_al_2009}) confirm these results.

Observations and ocean reanalysis ({cite.13.'Stammer_et_al_2011}; 2013) also agree in showing that steric spatial patterns over the last half of the 20th century fluctuate in space and time as part of modes of the coupled ocean–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} system such as {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, and the {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO} ({cite.13.'Levitus_et_al_2005}; {cite.13.'Lombard_et_al_2005a}; Di Lorenzo et al., 2010; {cite.13.'Lozier_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Zhang_and_Church_2012}). In these cases, regional sea level variability is associated with changing wind fields and resulting changes in the ocean circulation ({cite.13.'Kohl_and_Stammer_2008}). For example, the large rates of sea level rise in the western tropical Pacific and of sea level fall in the eastern Pacific over the period 1993–2010 correspond to an increase in the strength of the trade winds in the central and eastern tropical Pacific over the same period ({cite.13.'Timmermann_et_al_2010}; {cite.13.'Merrifield_and_Maltrud_2011}; {cite.13.'Nidheesh_et_al_2012}). The long-term sea level {Glossary.*Trend trend} from 1958 to 2001 in the tropical Pacific can also be explained as the ocean’s dynamical response to variations in the wind {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.13.'Qiu_and_Chen_2006}; {cite.13.'Timmermann_et_al_2010}).

Spatial variations in trends in regional sea level may also be specific to a particular sea or ocean basin. For example, a sea level rise of 5.4 ± 0.3 mm yr–1 in the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} between Japan and Korea from 1993 to 2001 is nearly two times the GMSL trend, with more than 80% of this rise being thermosteric ({cite.13.'Kang_et_al_2005}). {cite.13.'Han_et_al_2010 Han et al. (2010)} found that regional changes of sea level in the Indian Ocean that have emerged since the 1960s are driven by changing surface winds associated with a combined enhancement of Hadley and Walker Cells.
