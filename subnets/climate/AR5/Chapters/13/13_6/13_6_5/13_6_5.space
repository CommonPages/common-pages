section 13_6_5

  |Regional relative {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} can be estimated from a combination of the various contributions to {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} described above, emerging from the ocean, atmospheric pressure loading and the solid Earth. {'Figure_13_23 Figure 13.23} shows the combination of the natural variability (annual mean) and the CMIP5 projected sea level rise for the RCP4.5 scenario for a number of locations distributed around the world.
