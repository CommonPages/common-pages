title: 7.1.2 - Rationale for Assessing Clouds, Aerosols and Their Interactions

The representation of cloud processes in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} has been recognized for decades as a dominant {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in our understanding of changes in the climate system (e.g., {cite.7.'Arakawa_1975}, 2004; {cite.7.'Charney_et_al_1979}; {cite.7.'Cess_et_al_1989}; {cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2003}; {cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2006}), but has never been systematically assessed by the IPCC before. Clouds respond to climate forcing mechanisms in multiple ways, and inter-model differences in cloud feedbacks constitute by far the primary source of spread of both equilibrium and transient climate responses simulated by climate models ({cite.7.'Dufresne_and_Bony_2008}) despite the fact that most models agree that the {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} is positive ({cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2007}; {Chapters.7.7_2 Section 7.2}). Thus confidence in climate {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} requires a thorough assessment of how cloud processes have been accounted for.

Aerosols of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} origin are responsible for a {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF) of climate change through their interaction with radiation, and also as a result of their interaction with clouds. Quantification of this forcing is fraught with {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({cite.7.'Haywood_and_Boucher_2000}; {cite.7.'Lohmann_and_Feichter_2005}) and aerosols dominate the uncertainty in the total anthropogenic RF ({cite.7.'Forster_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Haywood_and_Schulz_2007}; {Chapters.8 Chapter 8}). Furthermore, our inability to better quantify non-{Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} RFs, and primarily those that result from {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}– cloud interactions, underlie difficulties in constraining {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} from observations even if we had a perfect knowledge of the temperature record ({cite.7.'Andreae_et_al_2005}). Thus a complete understanding of past and future climate change requires a thorough assessment of aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions.
