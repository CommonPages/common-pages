title: 7.6.1 - Introduction

In this section we outline some of the main processes thought to control the climatological distribution of precipitation and precipitation extremes. Emphasis is placed on large-scale constraints that relate to processes, such as changes in the water vapour {Glossary.*Mixing_ratio mixing ratio} that accompany warming, or changes in atmospheric heating rates that accompany changing GHG and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} concentrations, which are discussed earlier in this chapter. The fidelity with which large-scale models represent different aspects of precipitation, ranging from the diurnal cycle to extremes, is discussed in {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1 Section 9.4.1}. Building on, and adding to, concepts developed here, {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2 Section 11.3.2} presents near term {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of changes in regional precipitation features. Projections of changes on longer time scales, again with more emphasis on regionally specific features and the coupling to the land surface, are presented in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5 Section 12.4.5}. The effect of processes discussed in this section on specific precipitation systems, such as the {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon}, the intertropical convergence zones, or tropical cyclones are presented in {Chapters.14 Chapter 14}.

Precipitation is sustained by the availability of moisture and energy. In a globally averaged sense the oceans provide an unlimited supply of moisture, so that precipitation formation is energetically limited ({cite.7.'Mitchell_et_al_1987}). Locally precipitation can be greatly modified by limitations in the availability of moisture (for instance over land) and the effect of circulation systems, although these too are subject to local energetic constraints ({cite.7.'Neelin_and_Held_1987}; {cite.7.'Raymond_et_al_2009}). There are many ways to satisfy these constraints, and {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} still exhibit substantial biases in their representation of the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation ({cite.7.'Stephens_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Liepert_and_Previdi_2012}; {Chapters.9.9_5 Section 9.5}). Nonetheless, through careful analysis, it is possible to identify robust features in the simulated response of precipitation to changes in precipitation drivers. In almost every case these can be related to well understood processes, as described below.
