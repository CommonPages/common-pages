title: 7.6.2 - The Effects of Global Warming on Large-Scale Precipitation Trends

The atmospheric water vapour {Glossary.*Mixing_ratio mixing ratio} is expected to increase with temperature roughly following the saturation value (e.g., with increases in surface values ranging from 6 to 10% °C–1 and larger increases aloft, see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_4.7_2_4_1 Section 7.2.4.1}). Increases in global mean precipitation are, however, constrained by changes in the net radiative cooling rate of the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}. {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}, whose detailed treatment of radiative transfer provides a basis for calculating these energetic limitations, suggest that for the {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}, globally-averaged precipitation increases with global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} at about 1 to 3% °C–1 ({cite.7.'Mitchell_et_al_1987}; {cite.7.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.7.'Richter_and_Xie_2008}). Precipitation changes evince considerable regional variability about the globally averaged value; generally speaking precipitation is expected to increase in the wettest latitudes, whereas dry latitudes may even see a precipitation decrease ({cite.7.'Mitchell_et_al_1987}; {cite.7.'Allen_and_Ingram_2002}; {cite.7.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). On smaller scales, or near precipitation margins, the response is less clear due to model-specific, and less well understood, regional circulation shifts ({cite.7.'Neelin_et_al_2006}), but there is some evidence that the sub-tropical dry zones are expanding ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_2 Section 7.2.5.2} and {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_5 Section 2.7.5}), both as a result of the tropical convergence zones narrowing ({cite.7.'Neelin_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Chou_et_al_2009}), and the {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} moving poleward ({cite.7.'Allen_et_al_2012}) and strengthening (O’Gorman and Schneider, 2008).

The ‘wet-get-wetter’ and ‘dry-get-drier’ response that is evident at large scales over oceans can be understood as a simple consequence of a change in the water vapour content carried by circulations, which otherwise are little changed ({cite.7.'Mitchell_et_al_1987}; {cite.7.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). Wet regions are wet because they import moisture from dry regions, increasingly so with warmer temperatures. These ideas have withstood additional analysis and scrutiny since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.7.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Seager_et_al_2010}; Muller and O’Gorman, 2011), are evident in 20th century precipitation trends ({cite.7.'Allan_and_Soden_2007}; {cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2007b}; see {Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_1 Section 2.5.1}) and are assessed on different time scales in Chapters {Chapters.11} and {Chapters.12}. Because the wet-get-wetter argument implies that precipitation changes associated with warming correlate with the present-day pattern of precipitation, biases in the simulation of present-day precipitation will lead to biases in the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of future precipitation change ({cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2013}).

The wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier response pattern is mitigated, particularly in the dry regions, by the anticipated slowdown of the atmospheric circulation (as also discussed in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_3 Section 7.2.5.3}), as well as by gains from local surface evaporation. The slowdown within the descent regions can be partly understood as a consequence of the change in the dry static stability of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} with warming. And although this line of argument is most effective for explaining changes over the ocean ({cite.7.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2013}), it can also be used to understand the GCM land responses to some extent (Muller and O’Gorman, 2011).

The non-uniform nature of surface warming induces regional circulation shifts that affect precipitation trends. In the tropics SSTs warm more where winds are weak and thus are less effective in damping {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} anomalies, and precipitation systematically shifts to regions that warm more ({cite.7.'Xie_et_al_2010}). The greater warming over land, and its regional variations, also affect the regional distributions of precipitation ({cite.7.'Joshi_et_al_2008}). However, low understanding of {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture}–precipitation feedbacks complicates interpretations of local responses to warming over land ({cite.7.'Hohenegger_et_al_2009}), so that the effect of warming on precipitation at the scale of individual catchments is not well understood. Some broad-scale responses, particularly over the ocean, are more robust and relatively well understood.
