title: 7.6.4 - Effects of Aerosol–Cloud Interactions on Precipitation

{Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol}–cloud interactions directly influence the cloud microphysical structure, and only indirectly (if at all) the net atmospheric heating rate, and for this reason have mostly been explored in terms of their effect on the character and spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation, rather than on the globally-averaged amount of precipitation.

The sensitivity of simulated clouds to their microphysical development (e.g., {cite.7.'Fovell_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Parodi_and_Emanuel_2009}) suggests that they may be susceptible to the availability of {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} and IN. For instance, an increase in CCN favours smaller cloud droplets, which delays the onset of precipitation and the formation of ice particles in convective clouds ({cite.7.'Rosenfeld_and_Woodley_2001}; {cite.7.'Khain_et_al_2005}). It has been hypothesized that such changes may affect the vertical distribution and total amount of latent heating in ways that would intensify or invigorate convective storms, as measured by the strength and vertical extent of the convective updraughts ({cite.7.'Andreae_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Rosenfeld_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Rosenfeld_and_Bell_2011}; {cite.7.'Tao_et_al_2012}). Support for the idea that the availability of CCN influences the vigour of convective systems can be found in some modelling studies, but the strength, and even sign, of such an effect has been shown to be contingent on a variety of environmental factors ({cite.7.'Seifert_and_Beheng_2006}; {cite.7.'Fan_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Khain_2009}; {cite.7.'Seifert_et_al_2012}) as well as on modelling assumptions ({cite.7.'Ekman_et_al_2011}).

Observational studies, based on large data sets that sample many convective systems, report systematic correlations between aerosol amount and cloud-top temperatures ({cite.7.'Devasthale_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Koren_et_al_2010a}; {cite.7.'Li_et_al_2011}). Weekly cycles in cloud properties and precipitation, wherein convective intensity, cloud cover or precipitation increases during that part of the week when aerosol concentrations are largest, have also been reported (Bäumer and Vogel, 2007;

{cite.7.'Bell_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Rosenfeld_and_Bell_2011}). Both types of studies have been interpreted in terms of an aerosol influence on convective cloud systems. However, whether or not these findings demonstrate that a greater availability of CCN systematically invigorates, or otherwise affects, {Glossary.*Convection convection} remains controversial. Many of the weekly cycle studies are disputed on statistical or other methodological grounds ({cite.7.'Barmet_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Stjern_2011}; {cite.7.'Tuttle_and_Carbone_2011}; {cite.7.'SanchezLorenzo_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Yuter_et_al_2013}). Even in cases where relationships between aerosol amount and some measure of convective intensity appear to be unambiguous, the interpretation that this reflects an aerosol effect on the convection is less clear, as both aerosol properties and convection are strongly influenced by meteorological factors that are not well controlled for (e.g., {cite.7.'Boucher_and_Quaas_2013}). Studies that have used CRMs to consider the net effect of aerosol–cloud interactions integrated over many storms, or in more of a climate context wherein convective heating must balance radiative cooling within the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, also do not support a strong and systematic invigoration effect resulting from very large (many fold) changes in the ambient aerosol ({cite.7.'Morrison_and_Grabowski_2011}; van den Heever et al., 2011; {cite.7.'Seifert_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_and_Yang_2013}). Locally in space or time, however, radiative processes are less constraining, leaving open the possibility of stronger effects from localized or transient aerosol perturbations.

Because precipitation development in clouds is a time-dependent process, which proceeds at rates that are partly determined by the cloud microphysical structure (Seifert and Zängl, 2010), aerosol–cloud interactions may lead to shifts in topographic precipitation to the leeward side of mountains when precipitation is suppressed, or to the windward side in cases when it is more readily initiated. Orographic clouds show a reduction in the annual precipitation over topographical barriers downwind of major urban areas in some studies ({cite.7.'Givati_and_Rosenfeld_2004}; {cite.7.'Jirak_and_Cotton_2006}) but not in others ({cite.7.'Halfon_et_al_2009}). Even in cases where effects are reported, the results have proven sensitive to how the data are analysed ({cite.7.'Alpert_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Levin_and_Cotton_2009}).

In summary, it is unclear whether changes in aerosol–cloud interactions arising from changes in the availability of CCN or IN can affect, and possibly intensify, the evolution of individual precipitating cloud systems. Some observational and modelling studies suggest such an effect, but are undermined by alternative interpretations of the observational evidence, and a lack of robustness in the modelling studies. The evidence for systematic effects over larger areas and long time periods is, if anything, more limited and ambiguous.
