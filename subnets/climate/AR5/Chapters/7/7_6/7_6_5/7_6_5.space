  |There is high confidence from the model and observational evidence that the intensity of extreme precipitation events will increase with warming, at a rate well exceeding that of the mean precipitation. There is medium confidence that the increase is roughly 5 to 10% °C–1 warming but may vary with time scale, location and season.
