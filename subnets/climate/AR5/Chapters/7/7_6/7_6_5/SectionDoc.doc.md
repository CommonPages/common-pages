title: 7.6.5 - The Physical Basis for Changes in Precipitation Extremes

The physical basis for {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} microphysical effects on convective intensity was discussed in the previous section. Here we briefly discuss process understanding of the effect of warming on precipitation extremes; observed trends supporting these conclusions are presented in {Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_2 Section 2.6.2}.

Precipitation within individual storms is expected to increase with the available moisture content in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} or near the surface rather than with the global precipitation ({cite.7.'Allen_and_Ingram_2002}; {cite.7.'Held_and_Soden_2006}), which leads to a 6 to 10% °C–1 increase, but with longer intervals between storms (O’Gorman and Schneider, 2009). Because {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} are generally poor at simulating precipitation extremes ({cite.7.'Stephens_et_al_2010}) and predicted changes in a warmer climate vary ({cite.7.'Kharin_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Sugiyama_et_al_2010}), they are not usually thought of as a {Glossary.*Source source} of reliable information regarding extremes. However, a recent study (O’Gorman, 2012) shows that GCM {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} of extremes can be constrained by observable relationships in the present day climate, and upon doing so become broadly consistent with the idea that extreme precipitation increases by 6 to 10% per °C of warming. Central estimates of sensitivity of extreme (99.9th percentile) daily rainfall to global temperature from this study were 10% °C–1 in the tropics (O’Gorman, 2012), compared to 5% °C–1 predicted by the models in the extratropics, where they may be more reliable (O’Gorman and Schneider, 2009). How precipitation extremes depend on temperature has also been explored using cloud resolving simulations (but only for tropical conditions) which produce similar increases in extreme instantaneous rain rate ({cite.7.'Romps_2011}) and daily or hourly rain totals ({cite.7.'Muller_et_al_2011}) within storms ({'Figure_7_21 Figure 7.21}). Because these latter studies are confined to small domains, they may exclude important synoptic or larger-scale dynamical changes such as increases in flow convergence ({cite.7.'Chou_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Sugiyama_et_al_2010}).

By taking advantage of natural variability in the present day climate, a number of studies have correlated observed rainfall extremes with local temperature variations. In the extratropics, these studies document sensitivities of extreme precipitation to temperature much higher than those reported above (Lenderink and Van Meijgaard, 2008), but sensitivities vary with temperature ({cite.7.'Lenderink_et_al_2011}), are often negative in the tropics (Hardwick {cite.7.'Jones_et_al_2010}) and usually strengthen at the shortest (e.g., hourly or less) time scales (e.g., {cite.7.'Haerter_et_al_2010}; Hardwick {cite.7.'Jones_et_al_2010}). However, local temperature changes may not be a good {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} for global warming because they tend to co-vary with other meteorological factors (such as humidity, atmospheric stability, or wind direction) in ways that are uncharacteristic of changes in the mean temperature (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_7 Section 7.2.5.7}), and these other meteorological factors may dominate the observed signal (e.g., {cite.7.'Haerter_and_Berg_2009}). Thus, the idea that precipitation extremes depend much more strongly on temperature than the 5 to 10% increase per degree Celsius attributable to water vapour changes, remains controversial.

Following the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, studies have also continued to show that extremes in precipitation are associated with the coincidence of particular weather patterns (e.g., {cite.7.'Lavers_et_al_2011}). We currently lack an adequate understanding of what controls the return time and persistence of such rare events.

From the aforementioned model and observational evidence, there is high confidence that the intensity of extreme precipitation events will increase with warming, at a rate well exceeding that of the mean precipitation. There is medium confidence that the increase is roughly 5 to 10% °C–1 warming but may vary with time scale, location and season.
