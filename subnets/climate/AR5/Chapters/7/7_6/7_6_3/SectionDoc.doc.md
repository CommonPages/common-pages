title: 7.6.3 - Radiative Forcing of the Hydrological Cycle

In the absence of a compensating temperature change, an increase in {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect well-mixed GHG} concentrations tends to reduce the net radiative cooling of the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}. This reduces the rainfall rate and the strength of the overturning circulation ({cite.7.'Andrews_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2013}), such that the increase in global mean precipitation would be 1.5 to 3.5% °C–1 due to temperature alone but is reduced by about 0.5% °C–1 due to the effect of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({cite.7.'Lambert_and_Webb_2008}). The dynamic effects are similar to those that result from the effect of atmospheric warming on the {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate}, which also reduces the strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation (e.g., {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_2 Section 7.6.2}), and are robustly evident over a wide range of models and model configurations ({cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2013}; see also {'Figure_7_20 Figure 7.20}). These circulation changes influence the regional response, and are more pronounced over the ocean, because asymmetries in the land-sea response to changing concentrations of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} ({cite.7.'Joshi_et_al_2008}) amplify the maritime and dampen or even reverse the terrestrial signal ({cite.7.'Wyant_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2013}).

The dependence of the intensity of the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} on the tropospheric cooling rate helps to explain why perturbations having the same RF do not produce the same precipitation responses. Apart from the relatively small increase in absorption by atmospheric water vapour, increased solar {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} does not directly affect the net tropospheric cooling rate. As a result the hydrological cycle mostly feels the subsequent warming through its influence on the rate of tropospheric cooling ({cite.7.'Takahashi_2009}). This is why modeling studies suggest that {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} management ({Glossary.*Geoengineering geoengineering}) methods that maintain a constant {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} will lead to a reduction in globally averaged precipitation as well as different regional distributions of precipitation ({cite.7.'Schmidt_et_al_2012b}; {Chapters.7.7_7.7_7_3 Section 7.7.3}).

Changes in cloud radiative effects, and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} RF can also be effective in changing the net radiative heating rate within the troposphere ({cite.7.'Lambert_and_Webb_2008}; {cite.7.'Pendergrass_and_Hartmann_2012}). Most prominently, absorption of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols is understood to reduce the globally averaged precipitation. But this effect may be offset by the tendency of absorbing aerosols to reduce the planetary {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}, thereby raising {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature}, leading to more precipitation ({cite.7.'Andrews_et_al_2009}). Heterogeneously distributed precipitation drivers such as clouds, aerosols and tropospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} will also induce circulations that may amplify or dampen their local impact on the hydrological cycle ({cite.7.'Ming_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Allen_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Shindell_et_al_2012}). Such regional effects are discussed further in {Chapters.14 Chapter 14} for the case of aerosols.
