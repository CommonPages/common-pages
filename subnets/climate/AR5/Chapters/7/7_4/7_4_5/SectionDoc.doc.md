title: 7.4.5 - Synthesis on Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

Earlier assessments considered the radiative implications of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}– cloud interactions as two complementary processes—{Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} effects—that together amplify {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. Since then the complexity of cloud system responses to aerosol perturbations has become more fully appreciated. Recent work at the process scale has identified compensating adjustments that make the system less susceptible to perturbation than might have been expected based on the earlier albedo and lifetime effects. Increases in the aerosol can therefore result in either an increase or a decrease in aerosol–cloud related forcing depending on the particular environmental conditions. Because many current {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} do not include the possibility of compensating effects that are not mediated by the large-scale state, there are grounds for expecting these models to overestimate the magnitude of {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci}. Nevertheless it is also possible that poorly understood and unrepresented interactions could cause real ERFaci to differ in either direction from that {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} by current models. Forcing estimates are discussed in {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_3 Section 7.5.3}.
