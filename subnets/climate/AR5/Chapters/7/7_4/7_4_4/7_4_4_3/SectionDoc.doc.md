title: 7.4.4.3 - Observations of Aerosol Effects on Arctic Ice and Mixed-Phase Stratiform Clouds

Arctic mixed-phase clouds have received a great deal of attention since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, with major field programs conducted in 2004 ({cite.7.'Verlinde_et_al_2007}) and 2008 ({cite.7.'Jacob_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Brock_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'McFarquhar_et_al_2011}), in addition to long-term monitoring at high northern latitude stations (e.g., {cite.7.'Shupe_et_al_2008}) and analysis of earlier field experiments ({cite.7.'Uttal_et_al_2002}). Mixed-phase Arctic clouds persist for extended periods of time (days and even weeks; {cite.7.'Zuidema_et_al_2005}), in spite of the inherent instability of the ice–water mix (see also {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3.7_2_3_2.7_2_3_2_2 Section 7.2.3.2.2}). In spite of their low concentrations, IN have an important influence on cloud persistence, with clouds tending to glaciate and disappear rapidly when IN concentrations are relatively high and/or updraught velocities too small to sustain a liquid water layer (e.g., {cite.7.'Ovchinnikov_et_al_2011}). The details of the heterogeneous ice-nucleation mechanism remain controversial but there is increasing evidence that ice forms in Arctic stratus via the liquid phase (immersion freezing) so that the {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} population also plays an important role (de Boer et al., 2011; {cite.7.'Lance_et_al_2011}). If ice indeed forms via the liquid phase this represents a self-regulating {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} that helps sustain the mixed-phase clouds: as ice forms, liquid water (the {Glossary.*Source source} of the ice) is depleted, which restricts further ice formation and competition for water vapour via the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process ({cite.7.'Morrison_et_al_2012}).
