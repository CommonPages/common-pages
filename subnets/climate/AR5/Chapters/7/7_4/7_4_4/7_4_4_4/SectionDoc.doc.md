title: 7.4.4.4 - Advances in Process Level Understanding

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, research on ice-microphysical processes has been very active as evidenced by the abovementioned field experiments ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4.7_4_4_3 Section 7.4.4.3}). The persistence of some mixed-phase stratiform clouds has prompted efforts to explain this phenomenon in a theoretical framework ({cite.7.'Korolev_and_Field_2008}). Predicting cloud persistence may require a high level of understanding of very detailed processes. For example, ice particle growth by vapour diffusion depends strongly on crystal shape ({cite.7.'Harrington_et_al_2009}), the details of which may have similar relative influence on glaciation times to the representation of ice nucleation mechanism ({cite.7.'Ervens_et_al_2011b}). A recent review ({cite.7.'Morrison_et_al_2012}) discusses the myriad processes that create a resilient mixed-phase cloud system, invoking the ideas of ‘buffering’ seen in liquid clouds ({cite.7.'Stevens_and_Feingold_2009}). Importantly, the Wegener– Bergeron–Findeisen process does not necessarily destabilize the cloud system, unless sufficient ice exists ({cite.7.'Korolev_2007}). Bistability has also been observed in the mixed-phase Arctic cloud system; the resilient cloud state is sometimes interrupted by a cloud-free state ({cite.7.'Stramler_et_al_2011}), but there is much {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} regarding the meteorological and microphysical conditions determining which of these states is preferred.

Significant effort has been expended on heterogeneous freezing parameterizations employed in cloud or larger-scale models. Some parameterizations are empirical (e.g., {cite.7.'Lohmann_and_Diehl_2006}; {cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Phillips_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2008a}; {cite.7.'DeMott_et_al_2010};

{cite.7.'Gettelman_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Salzmann_et_al_2010}), whereas others attempt to represent the processes explicitly ({cite.7.'Jacobson_2003}) or ground the development of parameterizations in concepts derived from classical nucleation theory ({cite.7.'Chen_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2010b}). The details of how these processes are treated have important implications for tropical anvils ({cite.7.'Ekman_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Fan_et_al_2010}).

Homogeneous ice nucleation in cirrus clouds (at temperatures lower than about –38°C) depends crucially on the cloud updraught velocity and hence the supersaturation with respect to ice. The onset relative humidities for nucleation have been parameterized using results of parcel model simulations (e.g., {cite.7.'Sassen_and_Dodd_1988}; {cite.7.'Barahona_and_Nenes_2009}), airborne measurements in cirrus or wave clouds ({cite.7.'Heymsfield_and_Miloshevich_1995}; {cite.7.'Heymsfield_et_al_1998}), extensions of classical homogeneous ice nucleation theory ({cite.7.'Khvorostyanov_and_Sassen_1998}; {cite.7.'Khvorostyanov_and_Curry_2009}) and data from laboratory measurements (e.g., {cite.7.'Bertram_et_al_2000}; {cite.7.'Koop_et_al_2000}; {cite.7.'Mohler_et_al_2003}; {cite.7.'Magee_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Friedman_et_al_2011}). There is new evidence that although ice nucleation in cirrus has traditionally been regarded as homogeneous, the preferred freezing pathway may be heterogeneous because it occurs at lower onset relative humidities (or higher onset temperatures) than homogeneous nucleation ({cite.7.'Jensen_et_al_2010}). The onset relative humidities (or temperatures) for heterogeneous nucleation depend on the type and size of the IN ({Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_3.7_3_3_4 Section 7.3.3.4}).

Cloud resolving modeling of deep convective clouds points to the potential for {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}-related changes in cirrus anvils (e.g., {cite.7.'Morrison_and_Grabowski_2011}; van den Heever et al., 2011; Storer and van den Heever, 2013), but the physical mechanisms involved and their influence on {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} are poorly understood, and their global impact is unclear.
