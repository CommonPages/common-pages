title: 7.4.4.1 - The Physical Basis for Adjustments in Cold Clouds

Mixed-phase clouds, containing both liquid water and ice particles, exist at temperatures between 0°C and –38°C. At warmer temperatures ice melts rapidly, whereas at colder temperatures liquid water freezes homogeneously. The formation of ice in mixed-phase clouds depends on heterogeneous freezing, initiated by IN ({Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_3.7_3_3_4 Section 7.3.3.4}), which are typically solid or crystalline {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} particles. In spite of their very low concentrations (on the order of 1 per litre), IN have an important influence on mixed-phase clouds. Mineral dust particles have been identified as good IN but far less is known about the IN ability of other aerosol types, and their preferred modes of nucleation. For example, the ice nucleating ability of {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} particles remains controversial (Hoose and Möhler, 2012). Soluble matter can hinder glaciation by depressing the freezing temperature of supercooled drops to the point where homogeneous freezing occurs (e.g., {cite.7.'Girard_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Baker_and_Peter_2008}). Hence {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} perturbations to the aerosol have the potential to affect glaciation, water and ice optical properties, and their {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect}.

Because the equilibrium vapour pressure with respect to ice is lower than that with respect to liquid, the initiation of ice in a supercooled liquid cloud will cause vapour to diffuse rapidly toward ice particles at the expense of the liquid water (Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process; e.g., {cite.7.'Schwarzenbock_et_al_2001}; {cite.7.'Verheggen_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Hudson_et_al_2010}). This favours the depositional growth of ice crystals, the largest of which may sediment away from the water-saturated {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, influencing the subsequent evolution of the cloud. Hence anthropogenic perturbations to the IN can influence the rate at which ice forms, which in turn may regulate cloud amount ({cite.7.'Lohmann_2002b}; {cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2011}; see also {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3.7_2_3_2.7_2_3_2_2 Section 7.2.3.2.2}), cloud optical properties and humidity near the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause}.

Finally, formation of the ice phase releases latent heat to the environment (influencing cloud dynamics), and provides alternate, complex pathways for precipitation to develop (e.g., {cite.7.'Zubler_et_al_2011}, and {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_4 Section 7.6.4}).
