title: 7.4.4.2 - Observations of ERFaci in Deep Convective Clouds

As noted in {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_2.7_4_2_2 Section 7.4.2.2}, observations have demonstrated correlations between {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} loading and ice crystal size but influence on cloud optical depth is unclear (e.g., {cite.7.'Koren_et_al_2005}). Satellite remote sensing suggests that aerosol-related invigoration of deep convective clouds may generate more extensive anvils that radiate at cooler temperatures, are optically thinner, and generate a positive contribution to {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} ({cite.7.'Koren_et_al_2010b}). The global influence on ERFaci is unclear.
