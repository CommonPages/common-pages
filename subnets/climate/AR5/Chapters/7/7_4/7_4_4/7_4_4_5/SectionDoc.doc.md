title: 7.4.4.5 - Advances in and Insights Gained from Large-Scale Modelling Studies

Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, mixed-phase and ice clouds have received significant attention, with effort on representation of both heterogeneous (mixedphase clouds) and homogeneous (cirrus) freezing processes in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} (e.g., Lohmann and Kärcher, 2002; {cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2008a}). In {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} the physics of cirrus clouds usually involves only ice-phase microphysical processes and is somewhat simpler than that of mixed-phase clouds. Nevertheless, representation of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions in mixed-phase and ice clouds is considerably less advanced than that involving liquid-only clouds.

Our poor understanding of the climatology and lifecycle of aerosol particles that can serve as IN complicates attempts to assess what constitutes an {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} perturbation to the IN population, let alone the effect of such a perturbation. {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} can impact background (i.e., non contrail) cirrus by affecting ice nucleation properties but the effect remains uncertain (Kärcher et al., 2007). The numerous GCM studies that have evaluated {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} for ice clouds are summarised in {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_4 Section 7.5.4}.
