title: 7.4.6.2 - Physical Mechanisms Linking Cosmic Rays to Cloudiness

The most widely studied mechanism proposed to explain the possible influence of the cosmic ray flux on cloudiness is the ‘ion-{Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} clear air’ mechanism, in which atmospheric ions produced by cosmic rays facilitate aerosol nucleation and growth ultimately impacting {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} concentrations and cloud properties ({cite.7.'Carslaw_et_al_2002}; {cite.7.'Usoskin_and_Kovaltsov_2008}). The variability in atmospheric ionization rates due to changes in cosmic ray flux can be considered relatively well quantified ({cite.7.'Bazilevskaya_et_al_2008}), whereas resulting changes in aerosol nucleation rates are very poorly known ({cite.7.'Enghoff_and_Svensmark_2008}; {cite.7.'Kazil_et_al_2008}). Laboratory experiments indicate that ionization induced by cosmic rays enhances nucleation rates under middle and upper tropospheric conditions, but not necessarily so in the continental boundary layer ({cite.7.'Kirkby_et_al_2011}). Field measurements qualitatively support this view but cannot provide any firm conclusion due to the scarcity and other limitations of free-{Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} measurements ({cite.7.'Arnold_2006}; {cite.7.'Mirme_et_al_2010}), and due to difficulties in separating nucleation induced by cosmic rays from other nucleation pathways in the continental boundary layer ({cite.7.'Hirsikko_et_al_2011}). Based on surface aerosol measurements at one site, {cite.7.'Kulmala_et_al_2010 Kulmala et al. (2010)} found no connection between the cosmic ray flux and new particle formation or any other aerosol property over a {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} (1996–2008), although particles nucleated in the free troposphere are known to contribute to particle number and CCN concentrations in the boundary layer ({cite.7.'Merikanto_et_al_2009}). Our understanding of the ‘ion-aerosol clear air’ mechanism as a whole relies on a few model investigations that simulate changes in cosmic ray flux over a solar cycle ({cite.7.'Pierce_and_Adams_2009b}; Snow-Kropla et al., 2011; {cite.7.'Kazil_et_al_2012}) or during strong Forbush decreases ({cite.7.'Bondo_et_al_2010}; Snow-Kropla et al., 2011; {cite.7.'Dunne_et_al_2012}). Changes in CCN concentrations due to variations in the cosmic ray flux appear too weak to cause a significant {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} because the aerosol system is insensitive to a small change in the nucleation rate in the presence of pre-existing aerosols (see also {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_2.7_3_2_2 Section 7.3.2.2}).

A second pathway linking the cosmic ray flux to cloudiness has been proposed through the global electric circuit. A small direct current is able to flow vertically between the ionosphere and the Earth’s surface over fair-weather regions because of cosmic-ray-induced atmospheric ionization. Charge can accumulate at the upper and lower cloud boundaries as a result of the effective scavenging of ions by cloud droplets ({cite.7.'Tinsley_2008}). This creates conductivity gradients at the cloud edges ({cite.7.'Nicoll_and_Harrison_2010}), and may influence droplet–droplet collisions ({cite.7.'Khain_et_al_2004}), cloud droplet–particle collisions ({cite.7.'Tinsley_2008}) and cloud droplet formation processes ({cite.7.'Harrison_and_Ambaum_2008}). These microphysical effects may potentially influence cloud properties both directly and indirectly. Although {cite.7.'Harrison_and_Ambaum_2010 Harrison and Ambaum (2010)} observed a small reduction in downward {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation} that they associated with variations in surface current density, supporting observations are extremely limited. Our current understanding of the relationship between cloud properties and the global electric circuit remains very low, and there is no evidence yet that associated cloud processes could be of climatic significance.
