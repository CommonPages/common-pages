title: 7.4.6.1 - Observed Correlations Between Cosmic Rays and Properties of Aerosols and Clouds

Correlation between the cosmic ray flux and cloud properties has been examined for decadal variations induced by the 11-year {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle}, shorter variations associated with the quasi-periodic oscillation in {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity} centred on 1.68 years, or sudden and large variations known as Forbush decrease events. It should be noted that long-term variations in cloud properties are difficult to detect ({Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_6 Section 2.5.6}) while shortterm variations may be difficult to attribute to a particular cause. Moreover, the cosmic ray flux co-varies with other solar parameters such as solar and UV irradiance. This makes any {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution attribution} of cloud changes to the cosmic ray flux problematic ({cite.7.'Laken_et_al_2011}).

Some studies have shown co-variation between the cosmic ray flux and low-level cloud cover using global satellite data over periods of typically 5 to 10 years ({cite.7.'Marsh_and_Svensmark_2000}; Pallé Bagó and Butler, 2000). Such correlations have not proved to be robust when extending the time period under consideration ({cite.7.'Agee_et_al_2012}), and restricting the analysis to particular cloud types ({cite.7.'Kernthaler_et_al_1999}) or locations ({cite.7.'Udelhofen_and_Cess_2001}; {cite.7.'Usoskin_and_Kovaltsov_2008}). The purported correlations have also been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} variability ({cite.7.'Farrar_2000}; {cite.7.'Laken_et_al_2012}) and artefacts of the satellite data cannot be ruled out (Pallé, 2005). Statistically significant (but weak) correlations between the diffuse fraction of surface {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} and the cosmic ray flux have been found at some locations in the UK over the 1951–2000 period ({cite.7.'Harrison_and_Stephenson_2006}). {cite.7.'Harrison_2008 Harrison (2008)} also found a unique 1.68-year periodicity in surface radiation for two different UK sites between 1978 and 1990, potentially indicative of a cosmic ray effect of the same periodicity. {cite.7.'Svensmark_et_al_2009 Svensmark et al. (2009)} found large global reductions in the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} Ångström exponent, liquid water path, and cloud cover after large Forbush decreases, but these results were not corroborated by other studies that found no statistically significant links between the cosmic ray flux and clouds at the global scale (Čalogović et al., 2010; Laken and Čalogović, 2011). Although some studies found statistically significant correlations between the cosmic ray flux and cloudiness at the regional scale ({cite.7.'Laken_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Rohs_et_al_2010}), these correlations were generally weak, cloud changes were small, and the results were sensitive to how the Forbush events were selected and composited (Kristjánsson et al., 2008; {cite.7.'Laken_et_al_2009}).
