Correlations between cosmic ray flux and observed {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} or cloud properties are weak and local at best, and do not prove to be robust on the regional or global scale. Although there is some evidence that ionization from cosmic rays may enhance aerosol nucleation in the free {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, there is medium evidence and high agreement that the cosmic ray-ionization mechanism is too weak to influence global concentrations of {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} or droplets or their change over the last century or during a {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} in any climatically significant way.
