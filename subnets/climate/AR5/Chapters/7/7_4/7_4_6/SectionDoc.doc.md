title: 7.4.6 - Impact of Cosmic Rays on Aerosols and Clouds

Many studies have reported observations that link solar activity to particular aspects of the climate system (e.g., {cite.7.'Bond_et_al_2001}; {cite.7.'Dengel_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Eichler_et_al_2009}). Various mechanisms have been proposed that could amplify relatively small variations in total solar irradiance, such as changes in stratospheric and tropospheric circulation induced by changes in the spectral solar irradiance or an effect of the flux of cosmic rays on clouds. We focus in this subsection on the latter hypothesis while {Box_10_2 Box 10.2} discusses solar influences on the climate system more generally.

{Glossary.*Solar_activity Solar activity} variations influence the strength and three-dimensional structure of the heliosphere. High solar activity increases the deflection of low energy cosmic rays, which reduces the flux of cosmic rays impinging upon the Earthâ€™s {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. It has been suggested that the ionization caused by cosmic rays in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} has an impact on aerosols and clouds (e.g., {cite.7.'Dickinson_1975}; {cite.7.'Kirkby_2007}). This subsection assesses studies that either seek to establish a causal relationship between cosmic rays and aerosols or clouds by examining empirical correlations, or test one of the physical mechanisms that have been put forward to account for such a relationship.
