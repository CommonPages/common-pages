section 7_4_2

  |The cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect is the mechanism by which an increase in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} number concentration leads to an increase in the albedo of liquid clouds. The physical basis of the albedo effect is fairly well understood, with research since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} generally reinforcing earlier work.
