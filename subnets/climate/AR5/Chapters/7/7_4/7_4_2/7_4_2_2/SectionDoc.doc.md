title: 7.4.2.2 - Observational Evidence for Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

The physical basis of the {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect is fairly well understood, with research since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} generally reinforcing earlier work. Detailed in situ aircraft observations show that droplet concentrations observed just above the cloud base generally agree with those {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} based on the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} properties and updraught velocity observed below the cloud (e.g., {cite.7.'Fountoukis_et_al_2007}). Vertical profiles of cloud droplet effective radius also agree with those predicted by models that take into account the effect of entrainment ({cite.7.'Lu_et_al_2008}), although {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} still remain in estimating the shape of the droplet size distribution ({cite.7.'Brenguier_et_al_2011}), and the degree of entrainment mixing within clouds.

At relatively low aerosol loading (AOD less than about 0.3) there is ample observational evidence for increases in aerosol resulting in an increase in droplet concentration and decrease in droplet size (for constant liquid water) but uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude of this effect, and its sensitivity to spatial averaging. Based on simple metrics, there is a large range of physically plausible responses, with aircraft measurements (e.g., {cite.7.'Twohy_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Lu_et_al_2007}, 2008;; {cite.7.'Hegg_et_al_2012}) tending to show stronger responses than satellite-derived responses ({cite.7.'McComiskey_and_Feingold_2008}; {cite.7.'Nakajima_and_Schulz_2009}; {cite.7.'Grandey_and_Stier_2010}). At high AOD and high aerosol concentration, droplet concentration tends to saturate (e.g., {cite.7.'Verheggen_et_al_2007}) and, if the aerosol is absorbing, there may be reductions in droplet concentration and cloudiness ({cite.7.'Koren_et_al_2008}). This absorbing effect originates from aerosol–radiation interactions and is therefore part of {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari} ({Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_4.7_3_4_2 Section 7.3.4.2}). Negative correlation between AOD and ice particle size has also been documented in deep convective clouds (e.g., {cite.7.'Sherwood_2002}; {cite.7.'Jiang_et_al_2008}).
