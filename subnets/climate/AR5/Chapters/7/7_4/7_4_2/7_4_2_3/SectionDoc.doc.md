At the heart of the {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect lie two fundamental issues. The first is aerosol activation and its sensitivity to aerosol and dynamical parameters. The primary controls on droplet concentration are the aerosol number concentration (particularly at diameters greater than about 60 nm) and cooling rate (proportional to updraught velocity). {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} size distribution can play an important role under high aerosol loadings, whereas aerosol composition tends to be much less important, except perhaps under very polluted conditions and low updraught velocities (e.g., {cite.7.'Ervens_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'McFiggans_et_al_2006}). This is partially because aging tends to make particles more hygroscopic regardless of their initial composition, but also because more hygroscopic particles lead to faster water vapour {Glossary.*Uptake uptake}, which then lowers supersaturation, limiting the initial increase in activation.

The second issue is that the amount of energy reflected by a cloud system is a strong function of the amount of condensate. Simple arguments show that in a relative sense the amount of reflected energy is approximately two-and-a-half times more sensitive to changes in the liquid water path than to changes in droplet concentration ({cite.7.'Boers_and_Mitchell_1994}). Because both of these parameters experience similar ranges of relative variability, the magnitude of aerosolâ€“cloud related {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} rests mostly on dynamical factors such as turbulent strength and entrainment that control cloud condensate, and a few key aerosol parameters such as aerosol number concentration and size distribution, and to a much lesser extent, composition.
