title: 7.4.2.1 - The Physical Basis

The cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect ({cite.7.'Twomey_1977}) is the mechanism by which an increase in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} number concentration leads to an increase in the albedo of liquid clouds (reflectance of incoming {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}) by increasing the cloud droplet number concentration, decreasing the droplet size, and hence increasing total droplet surface area, with the liquid water content and cloud geometrical thickness hypothetically held fixed. Although only the change in the droplet concentration is considered in the original concept of the cloud albedo effect, a change in the shape of the droplet size distribution that is directly induced by the aerosols may also play a role (e.g., {cite.7.'Feingold_et_al_1997}; {cite.7.'Liu_and_Daum_2002}). In the Arctic, {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} aerosol may influence the longwave emissivity of optically thin liquid clouds and generate a positive {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} at the surface ({cite.7.'Garrett_and_Zhao_2006}; {cite.7.'Lubin_and_Vogelmann_2006}; {cite.7.'Mauritsen_et_al_2011}), but TOA forcing is thought to be negligible.
