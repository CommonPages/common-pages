title: 7.4.3.4 - Advances in and Insights Gained from Large-Scale Modelling Studies

Regional models are increasingly including representation of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}– cloud interactions using sophisticated microphysical models ({cite.7.'Bangert_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Yang_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Seifert_et_al_2012}). Some of these regional models are operational weather forecast models that undergo routine evaluation. {cite.7.'Yang_et_al_2011 Yang et al. (2011)} show improved simulations of stratocumulus fields when aerosol–cloud interactions are introduced. Regional models are increasingly being used to provide the meteorological context for satellite observations of aerosol–cloud interactions (see {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_1.7_4_1_4 Section 7.4.1.4}), with some (e.g., {cite.7.'Painemal_and_Zuidema_2010}) suggesting that droplet concentration differences are driven primarily by synoptic scale influences rather than aerosol.

GCM studies that have explored sensitivity to autoconversion {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} ({cite.7.'Golaz_et_al_2011}) show that {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} can vary by 1 W m–2 depending on the parameterization. Elimination of the sensitivity of rain formation to the autoconversion process has begun to be considered in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} ({cite.7.'Posselt_and_Lohmann_2009}). {cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2012 Wang et al. (2012)} have used satellite observations to constrain autoconversion and find a reduction in ERFaci of about 33% relative to a standard GCM autoconversion parameterization. It is worth reiterating that these {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are not necessarily associated with uncertainties in the physical process itself, but more so by the ability of a GCM to resolve the processes (see {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_1.7_4_1_3 Section 7.4.1.3}).
