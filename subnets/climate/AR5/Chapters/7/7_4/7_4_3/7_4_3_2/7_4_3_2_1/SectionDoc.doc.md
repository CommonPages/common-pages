title: 7.4.3.2.1 - Stratocumulus

The cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect is best manifested in so-called ship tracks, which are bright lines of clouds behind ships. Many ship tracks are characterized by an increase in the droplet concentration resulting from the increase in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} number concentration and an absence of drizzle size drops, which leads to a decrease in the droplet radius and an increase in the cloud albedo ({cite.7.'Durkee_et_al_2000}), all else equal. However, liquid water changes are the primary determinant of albedo changes ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_2.7_4_2_3 Section 7.4.2.3}; {cite.7.'Chen_et_al_2012}), therefore adjustments are key to understanding radiative response. {cite.7.'Coakley_and_Walsh_2002 Coakley and Walsh (2002)} showed that cloud water responses can be either positive or negative. This is supported by more recent shiptrack analyses based on new satellite sensors ({cite.7.'Christensen_and_Stephens_2011}): aerosol intrusions result in weak decreases in liquid water (−6%) in overcast clouds, but significant increases in liquid water (+39%) and increases in cloud fraction in precipitating, broken stratocumulus clouds. The global {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} of visible ship tracks has been estimated from satellite and found to be insignificant at about –0.5 mW m–2 ({cite.7.'Schreier_et_al_2007}), although this analysis may not have identified all shiptracks. Some observational studies downwind of ship tracks have been unable to distinguish aerosol influences from meteorological influences on cloud microphysical or macrophysical properties ({cite.7.'Peters_et_al_2011a}), although it is not clear whether their methodology had sufficient sensitivity to detect the aerosol effects. Notwithstanding evidence of shiptracks locally increasing the cloud fraction and albedo of broken cloud scenes quite significantly (e.g., {cite.7.'Christensen_and_Stephens_2011}; {cite.7.'Goren_and_Rosenfeld_2012}), their contribution to global ERFaci is thought to be small. These ship track results are consistent with satellite studies of the influence of long-term degassing of low-lying volcanic aerosol on stratocumulus, which point to smaller droplet sizes but ambiguous changes in cloud fraction and cloud water ({cite.7.'Gasso_2008}). The lack of clear evidence for a global increase in cloud albedo from shiptracks and volcanic plumes should be borne in mind when considering {Glossary.*Geoengineering geoengineering} methods that rely on cloud modification ({Chapters.7.7_7.7_7_2.7_7_2_2 Section 7.7.2.2}).

The development of precipitation in stratocumulus, whether due to aerosol or meteorological influence can, in some instances, change a highly reflective closed-cellular cloud field to a weakly reflective broken open-cellular field ({cite.7.'Comstock_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Stevens_et_al_2005a}; {cite.7.'vanZanten_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Sharon_et_al_2006}; Savic-Jovcic and Stevens, 2008; {cite.7.'Wang_and_Feingold_2009a}). In some cases, compact regions (pockets) of open-cellular {Glossary.*Convection convection} become surrounded by regions of closed-cellular convection. It is, however, noteworthy that observed precipitation rates can be similar in both open and closed-cell environments ({cite.7.'Wood_et_al_2011a}). The lack of any apparent difference in the large-scale environment of the open cells, versus the surrounding closed cellular convection, suggests the potential for multiple equilibria ({cite.7.'Baker_and_Charlson_1990}; {cite.7.'Feingold_et_al_2010}). Therefore in the stratocumulus regime, the onset of precipitation due to a dearth of aerosol may lead to a chain of events that leads to a large-scale reduction of cloudiness in agreement with {cite.7.'Liou_and_Ou_1989 Liou and Ou (1989)} and {cite.7.'Albrecht_1989 Albrecht (1989)}. The transition may be bidirectional: ship tracks passing through open-cell regions also appear to revert the cloud field to a closed-cell regime inducing a potentially strong ERFaci locally ({cite.7.'Christensen_and_Stephens_2011}; {cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011a}; {cite.7.'Goren_and_Rosenfeld_2012}).
