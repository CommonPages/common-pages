title: 7.4.3.2.2 - Trade-cumulus

Precipitation from trade cumuli proves difficult to observe, as the clouds are small, and not easily observed by space-based remote sensing techniques ({cite.7.'Stephens_et_al_2008}). Satellite remote sensing of trade cumuli influenced by {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} associated with slow volcanic degassing points to smaller droplet size, decreased precipitation efficiency, increased cloud amount and higher cloud tops ({cite.7.'Yuan_et_al_2011}). Other studies show that in the trade cumulus regime cloud amount tends to increase with precipitation amount: for example, processes that favour precipitation development also favour cloud development ({cite.7.'Nuijens_et_al_2009}); precipitation-driven colliding outflows tend to regenerate clouds; and trade cumuli that support precipitation reach heights where wind shear increases cloud fraction ({cite.7.'Zuidema_et_al_2012}).

While observationally based study of the microphysical aspects of aerosol–cloud interactions has a long history, more recent assessment of the ability of detailed models to reproduce the associated {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} in cumulus cloud fields is beginning to provide the important link between aerosol–cloud interactions and total {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} ({cite.7.'Schmidt_et_al_2009}).
