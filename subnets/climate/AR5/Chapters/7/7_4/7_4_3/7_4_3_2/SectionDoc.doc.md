title: 7.4.3.2 - Observational Evidence of Adjustments in Liquid Clouds

Since observed effects generally include both the {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect and the adjustments, with few if any means of observing only one or the other in isolation, in this section we discuss and interpret observational findings that reflect both effects. Stratocumulus and trade cumulus regimes are discussed separately.
