Central to {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} is the question of how susceptible is precipitation to droplet concentration, and by inference, to the available {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}. Some studies point to the droplet effective radius as a threshold indicator of the onset of drizzle ({cite.7.'Rosenfeld_and_Gutman_1994}; {cite.7.'Gerber_1996}; {cite.7.'Rosenfeld_et_al_2012}). Others focus on the sensitivity of the conversion of cloud water to rain water (i.e., autoconversion) to droplet concentration, which is usually in the form of (droplet concentration) to the power -a. Both approaches indicate that from the microphysical standpoint, an increase in the aerosol suppresses rainfall. Models and theory show a ranging from 1⁄2 ({cite.7.'Kostinski_2008}; {cite.7.'Seifert_and_Stevens_2010}) to 2 ({cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_and_Kogan_2000}), while observational studies suggest a = 1 (approximately the inverse of drop concentration; {cite.7.'Pawlowska_and_Brenguier_2003}; {cite.7.'Comstock_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'vanZanten_et_al_2005}). Note that thicker liquid clouds amplify rain via accretion of cloud droplets by raindrops, a process that is relatively insensitive to droplet concentration, and therefore to aerosol perturbations (e.g., {cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_and_Kogan_2000}). The balance of evidence suggests that a = 1⁄2 is more likely and that liquid water path (or cloud depth) has significantly more leverage over precipitation than does droplet concentration. Many {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} assume a much stronger relationship between precipitation and cloud droplet number concentration (i.e., a = 2) ({cite.7.'Quaas_et_al_2009}).

Small-scale studies ({cite.7.'Ackerman_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Xue_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Small_et_al_2009}) and satellite observations ({cite.7.'Lebsock_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Christensen_and_Stephens_2011}) tend to confirm two responses of the cloud liquid water to increasing aerosol. Under clean conditions when clouds are prone to precipitation, an increase in the aerosol tends to increase cloud amount as a result of aerosol suppression of precipitation. Under non-precipitating conditions, clouds tend to thin in response to increasing aerosol through a combination of droplet sedimentation ({cite.7.'Bretherton_et_al_2007}) and evaporation–entrainment adjustments (e.g., {cite.7.'Hill_et_al_2009}). Treatment of the subtlety of these responses and associated detail in small-scale cloud processes is not currently feasible in {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs}, although probability distribution function approaches are promising ({cite.7.'Guo_et_al_2010}).

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, cloud resolving model simulation has begun to stress the importance of scale interactions when addressing aerosol–cloud interactions. Model domains on the order of 100 km allow mesoscale circulations to develop in response to changes in the aerosol. These dynamical responses may have a significant impact on cloud morphology and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}. Examples include the significant changes in cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} associated with transitions between closed and open cellular states discussed above, and the cloud-free, downdraught ‘shadows’ that appear alongside ship tracks ({cite.7.'Wang_and_Feingold_2009b}). Similar examples of large-scale changes in circulation associated with aerosol and associated influence on precipitation are discussed in {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_4 Section 7.6.4}. These underscore the large gap between our process level understanding of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions and the ability of GCMs to represent them.
