title: 7.4.3.1 - The Physical Basis for Adjustments in Liquid Clouds

The adjustments giving rise to {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} are multi-faceted and are associated with both {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and so-called ‘{Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime}’ effects ({'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}). However, this old nomenclature is misleading because it assumes a relationship between cloud lifetime and cloud amount or water content. Moreover, the effect of the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} on cloud amount may have nothing to do with cloud lifetime per se (e.g., {cite.7.'Pincus_and_Baker_1994}).

The traditional view ({cite.7.'Albrecht_1989}; {cite.7.'Liou_and_Ou_1989}) has been that adjustment effects associated with aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions will add to the initial albedo increase by increasing cloud amount. The chain of reasoning involves three steps: that droplet concentrations depend on the number of available {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN}; that precipitation development is regulated by the droplet concentration; and that the development of precipitation reduces cloud amount ({cite.7.'Stevens_and_Feingold_2009}). Of the three steps, the first has ample support in both observations and theory ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_2.7_4_2_2 Section 7.4.2.2}). More problematic are the last two links in the chain of reasoning. Although increased droplet concentrations inhibit the initial development of precipitation (see {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3.7_4_3_2.7_4_3_2_1 Section 7.4.3.2.1}), it is not clear that such an effect is sustained in an evolving cloud field. In the trade-cumulus regime, some modelling studies suggest the opposite, with increased aerosol concentrations actually promoting the development of deeper clouds and invigorating precipitation ({cite.7.'Stevens_and_Seifert_2008}; see discussion of similar responses in deep convective clouds in {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_4 Section 7.6.4}). Others have shown alternating cycles of larger and smaller cloud water in both aerosol-perturbed stratocumulus ({cite.7.'Sandu_et_al_2008}) and trade cumulus ({cite.7.'Lee_et_al_2012}), pointing to the important role of environmental adjustment. There exists limited unambiguous observational evidence (exceptions to be given below) to support the original hypothesised cloud-amount effects, which are often assumed to hold universally and have dominated GCM {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of aerosol–cloud interactions. {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} lack the more nuanced responses suggested by recent work, which influences their ERFaci estimates.
