title: 7.4.1.2 - Advances and Challenges in Observing Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, numerous field studies (e.g., {cite.7.'Rauber_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Wood_et_al_2011b}; {cite.7.'Vogelmann_et_al_2012}) and laboratory investigations (e.g., {cite.7.'Stratmann_et_al_2009}) of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions have highlighted the numerous ways that the aerosol impacts cloud processes, and how clouds in turn modify the aerosol. The latter occurs along a number of pathways including aqueous chemistry, which adds aerosol mass to droplets (e.g., {cite.7.'Schwartz_and_Freiberg_1981}; {cite.7.'Ervens_et_al_2011a}); coalescence scavenging, whereby drop collision–coalescence diminishes the droplet (and aerosol) number concentration ({cite.7.'Hudson_1993}) and changes the mixing state of the aerosol; new particle formation in the vicinity of clouds ({cite.7.'Clarke_et_al_1999}); and aerosol removal by precipitation (see also {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_2.7_3_2_2 Section 7.3.2.2}).

Satellite-based remote sensing continues to be the primary {Glossary.*Source source} of global data for aerosol–cloud interactions but concerns persist regarding how measurement artefacts affect retrievals of both aerosol (Tanré et al., 1996; Tanré et al., 1997; {cite.7.'Kahn_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Jeong_and_Li_2010}) and cloud properties ({cite.7.'Platnick_et_al_2003}; Yuekui and Di Girolamo, 2008) in broken cloud fields. Two key issues are that measurements classified as ‘cloud-free’ may not be, and that aerosol measured in the vicinity of clouds is significantly different than it would be were the cloud field, and its proximate cause (high humidity), not present (e.g., {cite.7.'Loeb_and_Schuster_2008}). The latter results from humidification effects on aerosol optical properties ({cite.7.'Charlson_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Su_et_al_2008}; Tackett and Di Girolamo, 2009; {cite.7.'Twohy_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Chand_et_al_2012}), contamination by undetectable cloud fragments ({cite.7.'Koren_et_al_2007}) and the remote effects of radiation scattered by cloud edges on aerosol retrieval ({cite.7.'Wen_et_al_2007}; Várnai and Marshak, 2009).

While most passive satellite retrievals are unable to distinguish aerosol layers above or below clouds from those intermingling with the cloud field, active space-based remote sensing (L’Ecuyer and Jiang, 2010) has begun to address this problem ({cite.7.'Stephens_et_al_2002}; {cite.7.'Anderson_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Huffman_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Chand_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Winker_et_al_2010}). Spectral polarization and multi-angular measurements can discriminate between cloud droplets and aerosol particles and thus improve estimates of aerosol loading and absorption (Deuzé et al., 2001; {cite.7.'Chowdhary_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Mishchenko_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Hasekamp_2010}).

Use of active remote sensing, both from monitoring ground stations (e.g., {cite.7.'McComiskey_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Li_et_al_2011}) and satellites (Costantino and Bréon, 2010), as well as aerosol proxies not influenced by cloud contamination of retrievals ({cite.7.'Jiang_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Berg_et_al_2011}) have emerged as a particular effective way of identifying whether aerosol and cloud perturbations are intermingled.

Because the aerosol is a strong function of air-mass history and origin, and is strongly influenced by cloud and precipitation processes ({cite.7.'Clarke_et_al_1999}; {cite.7.'Petters_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Anderson_et_al_2009}), and both are affected by meteorology (Engström and Ekman, 2010; {cite.7.'Boucher_and_Quaas_2013}), correlations between the aerosol and cloud, or precipitation, should not be taken as generally indicating a cloud response to the aerosol (e.g., {cite.7.'Painemal_and_Zuidema_2010}). Furthermore, attempts to control for other important factors (air-mass history or cloud dynamical processes) are limited by a lack of understanding of large-scale cloud controlling factors in the first place ({cite.7.'Anderson_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Siebesma_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Stevens_and_Brenguier_2009}). These problems are increasingly being considered in observationally based inferences of aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation, but ascribing changes in cloud properties to changes in the aerosol remains a fundamental challenge.
