title: 7.4.1.1 - Classification of Hypothesized Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

{cite.7.'Denman_et_al_2007 Denman et al. (2007)} catalogued several possible pathways via which the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} might affect clouds. Given the number of possible aerosol–cloud interactions, and the difficulty of isolating them individually, there is little value in attempting to assess each effect in isolation, especially because modelling studies suggest that the effects may interact and compensate ({cite.7.'Stevens_and_Feingold_2009}; {cite.7.'Morrison_and_Grabowski_2011}). Instead, all radiative consequences of aerosol– cloud interactions are grouped into an ‘effective {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} due to aerosol–cloud interactions’, or {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} ({'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}). ERFaci accounts for aerosol-related microphysical modifications to the cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} ({cite.7.'Twomey_1977}), as well as any secondary effects that result from clouds adjusting rapidly to changes in their environment (i.e., ‘{Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} effects’; {cite.7.'Albrecht_1989}; {cite.7.'Liou_and_Ou_1989}; {cite.7.'Pincus_and_Baker_1994}). We do assess the physical underpinnings of the cloud albedo effect, but in contrast to previous assessments, no longer distinguish the resultant forcing. Note that ERFaci includes potential radiative adjustments to the cloud system associated with aerosol–cloud interactions but does not include adjustments originating from aerosol–radiation interactions ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari}). Possible contributions to ERFaci from warm (liquid) clouds are discussed in {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3 Section 7.4.3}, separately from those associated with adjustments by cold (ice or mixed-phase) clouds ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 Section 7.4.4}). {'Figure_7_16 Figure 7.16} shows a schematic of many of the processes to be discussed in Sections {Chapters.7.7_4 7.4}, {Chapters.7.7_5 7.5} and {Chapters.7.7_6 7.6}.
