title: 7.4.1.3 - Advances and Challenges in Modelling Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

Modelling of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions must contend with the fact that the key physical processes are fundamentally occurring at the fine scale and cannot be represented adequately based on large-scale fields. There exist two distinct challenges: fundamental understanding of processes and their representation in large-scale models.

Fine-scale LES and CRM models ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2.7_2_2_1 Section 7.2.2.1}) have greatly advanced as a tool for testing the physical mechanisms proposed to govern aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions (e.g., {cite.7.'Ackerman_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'vanZanten_et_al_2011}). Their main limitation is that they are idealized, for example, they do not resolve synoptic scale circulations or allow for representation of orography. A general finding from explicit numerical simulations of warm (liquid) clouds is that various aerosol impact mechanisms tend to be mediated (and often buffered) by interactions across scales not included in the idealized {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} effects ({cite.7.'Stevens_and_Feingold_2009}). Specific examples involve the interplay between the drop-size distribution and mixing processes that determine cloud macrostructure ({cite.7.'Stevens_et_al_1998}; {cite.7.'Ackerman_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Bretherton_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Wood_2007}; {cite.7.'Small_et_al_2009}), or the dependence of precipitation development in stratiform clouds on details of the vertical structure of the cloud ({cite.7.'Wood_2007}). Thus warm clouds may typically be less sensitive to aerosol perturbations in nature than in large-scale models, which do not represent all of these compensating processes. Hints of similar behaviour in mixed-phase (liquid and ice) stratus are beginning to be documented ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4.7_4_4_3 Section 7.4.4.3}) but process-level understanding and representation in models are less advanced.

Regional models include realism in the form of non-idealized meteorology, synoptic scale forcing, variability in land surface, and diurnal/ monthly cycles (e.g., {cite.7.'Iguchi_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Bangert_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Seifert_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Tao_et_al_2012}), however, at the expense of resolving finescale cloud processes. Regional models have brought to light the possibility of aerosol spatial inhomogeneity causing changes in circulation patterns via numerous mechanisms including changes in the radiative properties of cloud anvils (van den Heever et al., 2011), changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation ({cite.7.'Lee_2012}; {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_2 Section 7.6.2}) or gradients in heating rates associated with aerosol–radiation interactions ({cite.7.'Lau_et_al_2006}; {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_4.7_3_4_2 Section 7.3.4.2}).

{Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}, our primary tool for quantifying global mean {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, now represent an increasing number of hypothesized aerosol–cloud interactions, but at poor {Glossary.*Resolution resolution}. {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} are being more closely scrutinized through comparisons to observations and to other models ({cite.7.'Quaas_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Penner_et_al_2012}). Historically, aerosol–cloud interactions in GCMs have been based on simple constructs (e.g., {cite.7.'Twomey_1977}; {cite.7.'Albrecht_1989}; {cite.7.'Pincus_and_Baker_1994}). There has been significant progress on parameterizing aerosol activation (e.g., {cite.7.'Ghan_et_al_2011}) and ice nucleation ({cite.7.'Liu_and_Penner_2005}; {cite.7.'Barahona_and_Nenes_2008}; {cite.7.'DeMott_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2010b}); however, these still depend heavily on unresolved quantities such as updraught velocity. Similarly, parameterizations of aerosol influences on cloud usually do not account for known non-monotonic responses of cloud amount and properties to aerosols ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3.7_4_3_2 Section 7.4.3.2}). Global models are now beginning to represent aerosol effects in convective, ice and mixed-phase clouds (e.g., {cite.7.'Lohmann_2008}; {cite.7.'Song_and_Zhang_2011}; {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_4 Section 7.6.4}). Nevertheless, for both liquid-only and mixed-phase clouds, these parameterizations are severely limited by the need to parameterize cloud-scale motions over a huge range of spatio-temporal scales ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3 Section 7.2.3}).

Although advances have been considerable, the challenges remain daunting. The response of cloud systems to aerosol is nuanced (e.g., {cite.7.'vanZanten_et_al_2011}) and the representation of both clouds and aerosol–cloud interactions in large-scale models remains primitive ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3 Section 7.2.3}). Thus it is not surprising that large-scale models exhibit a range of manifestations of aerosol–cloud interactions, which limits quantitative inference ({cite.7.'Quaas_et_al_2009}). This highlights the need to incorporate into GCMs the lessons learned from cloud-scale models, in a physically-consistent way. New ‘super-{Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization}’ and probability distribution function approaches ({cite.7.'Golaz_et_al_2002}; {cite.7.'Rio_and_Hourdin_2008}; {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2.7_2_2_2 Section 7.2.2.2}) hold promise, with recent results supporting the notion that aerosol forcing is smaller than simulated by standard {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011b}; see {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_3 Section 7.5.3}).
