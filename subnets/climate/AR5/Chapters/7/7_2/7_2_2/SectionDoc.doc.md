title: 7.2.2 - Cloud Process Modelling

Cloud formation processes span scales from the sub-micrometre scale of {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN}, to cloud-system scales of up to thousands of kilometres. This range of scales is impossible to resolve with numerical simulations on computers, and this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. Nonetheless progress has been made through a variety of modelling strategies, which are outlined briefly in this section, followed by a discussion in Section 7.2.3 of developments in representing clouds in global models. The implications of these discussions are synthesized in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3.7_2_3_5 Section 7.2.3.5}.
