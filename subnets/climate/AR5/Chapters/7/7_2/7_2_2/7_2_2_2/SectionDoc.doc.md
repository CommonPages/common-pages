title: 7.2.2.2 - Global Models with Explicit Clouds

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, increasing computer power has led to three types of developments in global atmospheric models. First, models have been run with {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} that is higher than in the past, but not sufficiently high that cumulus clouds can be resolved explicitly. Second, models have been run with resolution high enough to resolve (or ‘permit’) large individual cumulus clouds over the entire globe. In a third approach, the parameterizations of global models have been replaced by embedded CRMs. The first approach is assessed in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}. The other two approaches are discussed below.

Global Cloud-Resolving Models (GCRMs) have been run with grid spacings as small as 3.5 km ({cite.7.'Tomita_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Putman_and_Suarez_2011}). At present GCRMs can be used only for relatively short simulations of a few simulated months to a year or two on the fastest supercomputers, but in the not-too distant future they may provide climate {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. GCRMs provide a consistent way to couple convective circulations to large-scale dynamics, but must still parameterize the effects of individual clouds, microphysics and boundary-layer circulations.

Because they avoid the use of uncertain cumulus parameterizations, GCRMs better simulate many properties of convective circulations that are very challenging for many current conventional {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}, including the diurnal cycles of precipitation ({cite.7.'Sato_et_al_2009}) and the Asian summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} ({cite.7.'Oouchi_et_al_2009}). {cite.7.'Inoue_et_al_2010 Inoue et al. (2010)} showed that the cloudiness simulated by a GCRM is in good agreement with observations from CloudSat and CALIPSO, but the results are sensitive to the parameterizations of turbulence and cloud microphysics ({cite.7.'Satoh_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Iga_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Kodama_et_al_2012}).

Heterogeneous multiscale methods, in which CRMs are embedded in each grid cell of a larger scale model ({cite.7.'Grabowski_and_Smolarkiewicz_1999}), have also been further developed as a way to realize some of the advantages of GCRMs but at less cost. This approach has come to be known as super-{Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization}, because the CRM effectively replaces some of the existing GCM parameterizations (e.g., {cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_and_Randall_2001}; {cite.7.'Tao_et_al_2009}). Super-parameterized models, which are sometimes called multiscale modeling frameworks, occupy a middle ground between high-resolution ‘process models’ and ‘{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}’ (see {'Figure_7_8 Figure 7.8}), in terms of both advantages and cost.

Like GCRMs, super-parameterized models give more realistic simulations of the diurnal cycle of precipitation ({cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Pritchard_and_Somerville_2010}) and the Madden-Julian Oscillation ({cite.7.'Benedict_and_Randall_2009}) than most conventional {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs}; they can also improve aspects of the Asian monsoon and the El Niño–{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}; {cite.7.'Stan_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'DeMott_et_al_2011}). Moreover, because they also begin to resolve cloud-scale circulations, both strategies provide a framework for studying {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions that conventional GCMs lack ({cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011b}). Thus both types of global model provide important insights, but because neither of them fully resolves cloud processes, especially for low clouds (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2.7_2_2_1 Section 7.2.2.1}), their results must be treated with caution just as with conventional GCMs.
