title: 7.2.2.1 - Explicit Simulations in Small Domains

High-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} models in small domains have been widely used to simulate interactions of turbulence with various types of clouds. The grid spacing is chosen to be small enough to resolve explicitly the dominant turbulent eddies that drive cloud heterogeneity, with the effects of smaller-scale phenomena parameterized. Such models can be run in idealized settings, or with boundary conditions for specific observed cases. This strategy is typically called large-eddy simulation (LES) when boundary-layer eddies are resolved, and cloud-resolving model (CRM) when only deep cumulus motions are well resolved. It is useful not only in simulating cloud and precipitation characteristics, but also in understanding how turbulent circulations within clouds transport and process aerosols and chemical constituents. It can be applied to any type of cloud system, on any part of the Earth. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) can be used to study turbulence and cloud microphysics on scales of a few metres or less (e.g., {cite.7.'Andrejczuk_et_al_2006}) but cannot span crucial meteorological scales and is not further considered here.

Cloud microphysics, precipitation and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} interactions are treated with varying levels of sophistication, and remain a weak point in all models regardless of resolution. For example, recent comparisons to satellite data show that liquid water clouds in CRMs generally begin to rain too early in the day ({cite.7.'Suzuki_et_al_2011}). Especially for ice clouds, and for interactions between aerosols and clouds, our understanding of the basic micro-scale physics is not yet adequate, although it is improving. Moreover, microphysical effects are quite sensitive to co-variations of velocity and composition down to very small scales. High-resolution models, such as those used for LES, explicitly calculate most of these variations, and so provide much more of the information needed for microphysical calculations, whereas in a {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} they are not explicitly available. For these reasons, low-resolution (e.g., climate) models will have even more trouble representing local aerosol–cloud interactions than will high-resolution models. Parameterizations are under development that could account for the small-scale variations statistically (e.g., {cite.7.'Larson_and_Golaz_2005}) but have not been used in the Coupled {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations.

High-resolution models have enhanced our understanding of cloud processes in several ways. First, they can help interpret in situ and high-resolution remote sensing observations (e.g., {cite.7.'Stevens_et_al_2005b}; {cite.7.'Blossey_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Fridlind_et_al_2007}). Second, they have revealed important influences of small-scale interactions, turbulence, entrainment and precipitation on cloud dynamics that must eventually be accounted for in parameterizations (e.g., {cite.7.'Krueger_et_al_1995}; {cite.7.'Derbyshire_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Kuang_and_Bretherton_2006}; {cite.7.'Ackerman_et_al_2009}). Third, they can be used to predict how cloud system properties (such as cloud cover, depth, or {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect}) may respond to climate changes (e.g., {cite.7.'Tompkins_and_Craig_1998}; {cite.7.'Bretherton_et_al_2013}). Fourth, they have become an important tool in testing and improving parameterizations of cloud-controlling processes such as cumulus {Glossary.*Convection convection}, turbulent mixing, small-scale horizontal cloud variability and aerosol–cloud interactions ({cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2003}; {cite.7.'Rio_and_Hourdin_2008}; {cite.7.'Stevens_and_Seifert_2008}; {cite.7.'Lock_2009}; Del Genio and Wu, 2010; {cite.7.'Fletcher_and_Bretherton_2010}), as well as the interplay between convection and large-scale circulations ({cite.7.'Kuang_2008}).

Different aspects of clouds, and cloud types, require different grid resolutions. CRMs of deep convective cloud systems with horizontal resolutions of 2 km or finer ({cite.7.'Bryan_et_al_2003}) can represent some statistical properties of the cloud system, including fractional area coverage of cloud ({cite.7.'Xu_et_al_2002}), vertical thermodynamic structure ({cite.7.'Blossey_et_al_2007}), the distribution of updraughts and downdraughts ({cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_et_al_2009}) and organization into mesoscale convective systems ({cite.7.'Grabowski_et_al_1998}). Modern high-order turbulence closure schemes may allow some statistics of boundary-layer cloud distributions, including cloud fractions and fluxes of moisture and energy, to be reasonably simulated even at horizontal resolution of 1 km or larger ({cite.7.'Cheng_and_Xu_2006}, 2008). Finer grids (down to hundreds of metres) better resolve individual storm characteristics such as vertical velocity or tracer transport. Some cloud {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} properties remain sensitive to CRM microphysical {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} assumptions regardless of resolution, particularly the vertical distribution and optical depth of clouds containing ice.

Because of these requirements, it is computationally demanding to run a CRM in a domain large enough to capture convective organisation or perform regional forecasts. Some studies have created smaller regions of CRM-like resolution within realistically forced regional-scale models (e.g., {cite.7.'Zhu_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Boutle_and_Abel_2012}; {cite.7.'Zhu_et_al_2012}), a special case of the common ‘nesting’ approach for regional {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} (see {Chapters.9.9_6 Section 9.6}). One application has been to orographic precipitation, associated both with extratropical cyclones (e.g., {cite.7.'Garvert_et_al_2005}) and with explicitly simulated cumulus convection (e.g., {cite.7.'Hohenegger_et_al_2008}); better resolution of the orography improves the simulation of precipitation initiation and wind drift of falling rain and snow between watersheds.

LES of shallow cumulus cloud fields with horizontal grid spacing of about 100 m and vertical grid spacing of about 40 m produces vertical profiles of cloud fraction, temperature, moisture and turbulent fluxes that agree well with available observations ({cite.7.'Siebesma_et_al_2003}), though the simulated precipitation efficiency still shows some sensitivity to microphysical parameterizations ({cite.7.'vanZanten_et_al_2011}). LES of stratocumulus-topped boundary layers reproduces the turbulence statistics and vertical thermodynamic structure well (e.g., {cite.7.'Stevens_et_al_2005b}; {cite.7.'Ackerman_et_al_2009}), and has been used to study the sensitivity of stratocumulus properties to aerosols (e.g., Savic-Jovcic and Stevens, 2008; {cite.7.'Xue_et_al_2008}) and meteorological conditions. However, the simulated entrainment rate and cloud liquid water path are sensitive to the underlying numerical algorithms, even with vertical grid spacings as small as 5 m, due to poor resolution of the sharp capping inversion ({cite.7.'Stevens_et_al_2005a}).

These grid requirements mean that low-cloud processes dominating the known {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in cloud {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} cannot be explicitly simulated except in very small domains. Thus, notwithstanding all of the above benefits of explicit cloud modeling, these models cannot on their own quantify global cloud feedbacks or aerosol–cloud interactions definitively. They are important, however, in suggesting and testing feedback and adjustment mechanisms (see Sections {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5 7.2.5} and {Chapters.7.7_4 7.4}).
