title: 7.2.5.1 - Feedback Mechanisms Involving the Altitude of High-Level Cloud

A dominant contributor of positive cloud {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} in models is the increase in the height of deep convective outflows tentatively {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} to the so-called ‘fixed anvil-temperature’ mechanism ({cite.7.'Hartmann_and_Larson_2002}). According to this mechanism, the average outflow level from tropical deep convective systems is determined in steady state by the highest point at which water vapour cools the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} significantly through infrared {Topics.*Emissions emission}; this occurs at a particular water vapour partial pressure, therefore at a similar temperature (higher altitude) as climate warms. A positive feedback results because, since the cloud top temperature does not keep pace with that of the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, its emission to space does not increase at the rate expected for the no-feedback system. This occurs at all latitudes and has long been noted in model simulations ({cite.7.'Hansen_et_al_1984}; {cite.7.'Cess_et_al_1990}). This mechanism, with a small modification to account for {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} changes, predicts roughly +0.5 W m–2 °C–1 of positive longwave feedback in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} ({cite.7.'Zelinka_and_Hartmann_2010}), compared to an overall cloud-height feedback of +0.35 (+0.09 to +0.58) W m–2 °C–1 ({'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10}). Importantly, CRMs also reproduce this increase in cloud height ({cite.7.'Tompkins_and_Craig_1998}; {cite.7.'Kuang_and_Hartmann_2007}; {cite.7.'Romps_2011}; {cite.7.'Harrop_and_Hartmann_2012}).

On average, natural fluctuations in tropical high cloud amount exert little net TOA {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} in the current climate due to nearcompensation between their longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effects ({cite.7.'Harrison_et_al_1990}; {'Figure_7_7 Figure 7.7}). Similar compensation can be seen in the opposing variations of these two components of the high-{Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} across {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} ({'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10}). This might suggest that the altitude feedback could be similarly compensated. However, GCMs can reproduce the observed compensation in the present climate ({cite.7.'Sherwood_et_al_1994}) without producing one under global warming. In the above-noted cloud-resolving simulations, the entire cloud field (including the typical base) moved upward, in accord with a general upward shift of tropospheric fields (Singh and O’Gorman, 2012) and with drying at levels near cloud base ({cite.7.'Minschwaner_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Sherwood_et_al_2010b}). This supports the {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} of GCMs that the altitude feedback is not compensated by an increase in highcloud thickness or {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}.

The observational record offers limited further support for the altitude increase. The global {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} is rising as expected ({Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_4 Section 2.7.4}). Observed cloud heights change roughly as predicted with regional, seasonal and interannual changes in near-tropopause temperature structure ({cite.7.'Xu_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Eitzen_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Chae_and_Sherwood_2010}; {cite.7.'Zelinka_and_Hartmann_2011}), although these tests may not be good analogues for global warming. {cite.7.'Davies_and_Molloy_2012 Davies and Molloy (2012)} report an apparent recent downward mean cloud height {Glossary.*Trend trend} but this is probably an artefact ({cite.7.'Evan_and_Norris_2012}); observed cloud height trends do not appear sufficiently reliable to test this cloud-height feedback mechanism ({Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_6 Section 2.5.6}).

In summary, the consistency of GCM responses, basic understanding, strong support from process models, and weak further support from observations give us high confidence in a positive feedback contribution from increases in high-cloud altitude.
