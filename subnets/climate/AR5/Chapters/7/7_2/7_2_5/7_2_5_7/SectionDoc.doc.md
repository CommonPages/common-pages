title: 7.2.5.7 - Observational Constraints on Global Cloud Feedback

A number of studies since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} have attempted to constrain overall cloud {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} (or {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity}) from observations of natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}; here we discuss those using modern cloud, radiation or other measurements (see a complementary discussion in {Chapters.12.12_5 Section 12.5} based on past temperature data and forcing proxies).

One approach is to seek observable aspects of present-day cloud behaviour that reveal {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} or some component thereof. Varying parameters in a GCM sometimes produces changes in cloud feedback that correlate with the properties of cloud simulated for the present day, but this depends on the GCM ({cite.7.'Yokohata_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Gettelman_et_al_2013}), and the resulting relationships do not hold across multiple models such as those from CMIP3 ({cite.7.'Collins_et_al_2011}). Among the AR4 models, net cloud feedback correlates strongly with mid-latitude {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} ({cite.7.'Volodin_2008}), with TOA radiation at high southern latitudes ({cite.7.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010}), and with humidity at certain latitudes during boreal summer ({cite.7.'Fasullo_and_Trenberth_2012}); if valid each of these regression relations would imply a relatively strong positive cloud feedback in reality, but no mechanism has been proposed to explain or validate them and such apparent skill can arise fortuitously ({cite.7.'Klocke_et_al_2011}). Likewise, {cite.7.'Clement_et_al_2009 Clement et al. (2009)} found realistic decadal variations of cloud cover over the North Pacific in only one model (HadGEM1) and argued that the relatively strong cloud feedback in this model should therefore be regarded as more likely, but this finding lacks a mechanistic explanation and may depend on how model output is used ({cite.7.'Broccoli_and_Klein_2010}). {cite.7.'Chang_and_Coakley_2007 Chang and Coakley (2007)} examined mid-latitude maritime clouds and found cloud thinning with increasing temperature, consistent with a positive feedback, whereas {cite.7.'Gordon_and_Norris_2010 Gordon and Norris (2010)} found the opposite result following a methodology that tried to isolate thermal and advective effects. In summary, there is no evidence of a robust link between any of the noted observables and the global feedback, though some apparent connections are tantalizing and are being studied further.

Several studies have attempted to derive global climate sensitivity from interannual relationships between global mean observations of TOA radiation and {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} (see also {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2.10_8_2_2 Section 10.8.2.2}). One problem with this is the different spatial character of interannual and long-term warming; another is that the methodology can be confounded by cloud variations not caused by those of {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} ({cite.7.'Spencer_and_Braswell_2008}). A range of climate sensitivities has been inferred based on such analyses ({cite.7.'Forster_and_Gregory_2006}; {cite.7.'Lindzen_and_Choi_2011}). Crucially, however, among different {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} there is no correlation between the interannual and long-term cloud– temperature relationships ({cite.7.'Dessler_2010}; {cite.7.'Colman_and_Hanson_2012}), contradicting the basic assumption of these methods. Many but not all {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} predict relationships that are consistent with observations ({cite.7.'Dessler_2010}, 2013). More recently there is interest in relating the time-lagged correlations of cloud and temperature to feedback processes ({cite.7.'Spencer_and_Braswell_2010}) but again these relationships appear to reveal only a model’s ability to simulate {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} or other modes of interannual variability properly, which are not obviously informative about the cloud feedback on long-term global warming ({cite.7.'Dessler_2011}).

For a putative observational constraint on climate sensitivity to be accepted, it should have a sound physical basis and its assumptions should be tested appropriately in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. No method yet proposed meets both conditions. Moreover, cloud responses to warming can be sensitive to relatively subtle details in the geographic warming pattern, such as the slight hemispheric asymmetry due to the lag of southern ocean warming relative to northern latitudes ({cite.7.'Senior_and_Mitchell_2000}; {cite.7.'Yokohata_et_al_2008}). Cloud responses to specified uniform ocean warming without {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increases are not the same as those to CO2-induced global warming simulated with more realistic oceans ({cite.7.'Ringer_et_al_2006}), partly because of rapid adjustments ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_6 Section 7.2.5.6}) and because low clouds also feed back tightly to the underlying surface ({cite.7.'Caldwell_and_Bretherton_2009}). Simulated cloud feedbacks also differ significantly between colder and warmer climates in some models ({cite.7.'Crucifix_2006}; {cite.7.'Yoshimori_et_al_2009}) and between volcanic and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} ({cite.7.'Yokohata_et_al_2005}). These sensitivities highlight the challenges facing any attempt to infer long-term cloud feedbacks from simple data analyses.
