title: 7.2.5.5 - Feedback from Arctic Cloud Interactions with Sea Ice

Arctic clouds, despite their low altitude, have a net heating effect at the surface in the present climate because their downward {Topics.*Emissions emission} of {Glossary.*Infrared_radiation infrared radiation} over the year outweighs their reflection of sunlight during the short summer season. Their net effect on the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is cooling, however, so their effect on the {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} of the whole system is ambiguous and depends on the details of the vertical cloud distribution and the impact of cloud radiative interactions on ice cover ({cite.7.'Palm_et_al_2010}).

Low-cloud amount over the Arctic oceans varies inversely with {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} amount (open water producing more cloud) as now confirmed since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} by visual cloud reports ({cite.7.'Eastman_and_Warren_2010}) and lidar and radar observations ({cite.7.'Kay_and_Gettelman_2009}; {cite.7.'Palm_et_al_2010}). The observed effect is weak in boreal summer, when the melting sea ice is at a similar temperature to open water and stable boundary layers with extensive low cloud are common over both surfaces, and strongest in boreal autumn when cold air flowing over regions of open water stimulates cloud formation by boundary-layer {Glossary.*Convection convection} ({cite.7.'Kay_and_Gettelman_2009}; {cite.7.'Vavrus_et_al_2011}). {cite.7.'Kay_et_al_2011 Kay et al. (2011)} show that a GCM can represent this seasonal sensitivity of low cloud to open water, but doing so depends on the details of how boundary-layer clouds are parameterized. {cite.7.'Vavrus_et_al_2009 Vavrus et al. (2009)} show that in a global warming scenario, {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} simulate more Arctic low cloud in all seasons, but especially during autumn and the onset of winter when open water and very thin sea ice increase considerably, increasing upward moisture transport to the clouds.

A few studies in the literature suggest negative feedbacks from Arctic clouds, based on spatial correlations of observed warming and cloudiness ({cite.7.'Liu_et_al_2008}) or tree-ring proxies of cloud shortwave effects over the last millenium ({cite.7.'Gagen_et_al_2011}). However, the spatial correlations are not reliable indicators of {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_7 Section 7.2.5.7}), and the tree-ring evidence (assuming it is a good {Glossary.*Proxy proxy}) applies only to the shortwave effect of summertime cloud cover. The GCM studies would be consistent with warmer climates being cloudier, but have opposite radiative effects and positive feedback during the rest of the year. Even though a small positive feedback is suggested by models, there is overall little evidence for significant feedbacks from Arctic cloud.
