title: 7.2.5.2 - Feedback Mechanisms Involving the Amount of Middle and High Cloud

As noted in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_1 Section 7.2.5.1}, models simulate a range of nearly compensating differences in shortwave and longwave high-cloud feedbacks, consistent with different changes in high-cloud amount, but also show a net positive offset consistent with higher cloud altitude ({'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10}). However, there is a tendency in most {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} toward reduced middle and high cloud amount in warmer climates in lowand mid-latitudes, especially in the subtropics ({cite.7.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2009}; {cite.7.'Zelinka_and_Hartmann_2010}). This loss of cloud amount adds a positive shortwave and negative longwave {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} to the model average, which causes the average net positive feedback to appear to come from the shortwave part of the spectrum. The net effect of changes in amount of all cloud types averaged over models is a positive feedback of about +0.2 W m–2 °C–1, but this roughly matches the contribution from low clouds (see the following section), implying a near-cancellation of longwave and shortwave effects for the midand high-level amount changes.

Changes in {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} cloud cover geographically correlate with simulated subtropical drying ({cite.7.'Meehl_et_al_2007}), suggesting that they are partly tied to large-scale circulation changes including the poleward shifts found in most models ({cite.7.'Wetherald_and_Manabe_1980}; {cite.7.'Sherwood_et_al_2010b}; {Chapters.2.2_7 Section 2.7}). {cite.7.'Bender_et_al_2012 Bender et al. (2012)} and {cite.7.'Eastman_and_Warren_2013 Eastman and Warren (2013)} report poleward shifts in cloud since the 1970s consistent with those reported in other observables ({Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_6 Section 2.5.6}) and simulated by most {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs}, albeit with weaker amplitude ({cite.7.'Yin_2005}). This shift of clouds to latitudes of weaker sunlight decreases the planetary {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and would imply a strong positive feedback if it were due to global warming ({cite.7.'Bender_et_al_2012}), although it is probably partly driven by other factors ({Chapters.10.10_3 Section 10.3}). The true amount of positive feedback coming from poleward shifts therefore remains highly uncertain, but is underestimated by GCMs if, as suggested by observational comparisons, the shifts are underestimated ({cite.7.'Johanson_and_Fu_2009}; {cite.7.'Allen_et_al_2012}).

The upward mass flux in deep clouds should decrease in a warmer climate ({Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_2 Section 7.6.2}), which might contribute to cloudiness decreases in {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} or the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} ({cite.7.'Chou_and_Neelin_2004}; {cite.7.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). {cite.7.'Tselioudis_and_Rossow_2006 Tselioudis and Rossow (2006)} predict this within the storm tracks based on observed present-day relationships with meteorological variables combined with model-simulated changes to those driving variables but do not infer a large feedback. Most CMIP3 GCMs produce too little storm-track cloud cover in the southern hemisphere compared to nearly overcast conditions in reality, but clouds are also too bright. Arguments have been advanced that such biases could imply either model overestimation or underestimation of feedbacks ({cite.7.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010}; {cite.7.'Brient_and_Bony_2012}).

The role of thin cirrus clouds for {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} is not known and remains a {Glossary.*Source source} of possible systematic bias. Unlike high-cloud systems overall, these particular clouds exert a clear net warming effect ({cite.7.'Jensen_et_al_1994}; {cite.7.'Chen_et_al_2000}), making a significant cloudcover feedback possible in principle (e.g., {cite.7.'Rondanelli_and_Lindzen_2010}). While this does not seem to be important in recent GCMs ({cite.7.'Zelinka_et_al_2012b}), and no specific mechanism has been suggested, the representation of cirrus in GCMs appears to be poor ({cite.7.'Eliasson_et_al_2011}) and such clouds are microphysically complex ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 Section 7.4.4}). This implies significant feedback {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in addition to that already evident from {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread}.

Model simulations, physical understanding and observations thus provide medium confidence that poleward shifts of cloud distributions will contribute to positive feedback, but by an uncertain amount. Feedbacks from thin cirrus amount cannot be ruled out and are an important source of uncertainty.
