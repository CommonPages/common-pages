title: 7.2.5.6 - Rapid Adjustments of Clouds to a Carbon Dioxide Change

It is possible to partition the response of TOA radiation in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} to an instantaneous doubling of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} into a ‘{Glossary.*Rapid_adjustment rapid adjustment}’ in which the land surface, atmospheric circulations and clouds respond to the {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} of the CO2 increase, and an ‘{Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}-mediated’ response that develops more slowly as the oceans warm (see {Chapters.7.7_1.7_1_3 Section 7.1.3}). This distinction is important not only to help understand model processes, but because the presence of rapid adjustments would cause clouds to respond slightly differently to a transient climate change (in which SST changes have not caught up to CO2 changes) or to a climate change caused by other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, than they would to the same warming at equilibrium driven by CO2. There is also a rapid adjustment of the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} and precipitation field, discussed in {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_3 Section 7.6.3}.

{cite.7.'Gregory_and_Webb_2008 Gregory and Webb (2008)} reported that in some {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, rapid adjustment of clouds can have TOA radiative effects comparable to those of the ensuing SST-mediated cloud changes, though {cite.7.'Andrews_and_Forster_2008 Andrews and Forster (2008)} found a smaller effect. Subsequent studies using more accurate kernel-based techniques find a cloud adjustment of roughly +0.4 to +0.5 W m–2 per doubling of CO2, with standard deviation of about 0.3 W m–2 across models ({cite.7.'Vial_et_al_2013}; {cite.7.'Zelinka_et_al_2013}). This would account for about 20% of the overall cloud response in a model with average sensitivity; and because it is not strongly correlated with model sensitivity, it contributes perhaps 20% of the inter-model response spread ({cite.7.'Andrews_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Webb_et_al_2013}), which therefore remains dominated by feedbacks. The response occurs due to a general decrease in cloud cover caused by the slight stratification driven by CO2 warming of the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, which especially for middle and low clouds has a net warming effect ({cite.7.'Colman_and_McAvaney_2011}; {cite.7.'Zelinka_et_al_2013}). As explained at the beginning of {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5 Section 7.2.5}, {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} numbers given in this report already account for these rapid adjustments.
