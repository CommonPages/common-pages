title: 7.2.5 - Cloud Feedbacks and Rapid Adjustments to Carbon Dioxide

The dominant {Glossary.*Source source} of spread among {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} climate sensitivities in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} was due to diverging cloud feedbacks, particularly due to low clouds, and this continues to be true ({Chapters.9.9_7 Section 9.7}). All global models continue to produce a near-zero to moderately strong positive net cloud {Glossary.*Feedback feedback}. Progress has been made since the AR4 in understanding the reasons for positive feedbacks in models and providing a stronger theoretical and observational basis for some mechanisms contributing to them. There has also been progress in quantifying feedbacks—including separating the effects of different cloud types, using radiative-kernel residual methods ({cite.7.'Soden_et_al_2008}) and by computing cloud effects directly (e.g., {cite.7.'Zelinka_et_al_2012a})—and in distinguishing between feedback and adjustment responses ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_6 Section 7.2.5.6}).

Until very recently cloud feedbacks have been diagnosed in models by differencing cloud radiative effects in doubled {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and control climates, normalized by the change in global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature}. Different diagnosis methods do not always agree, and some simple methods can make positive cloud feedbacks look negative by failing to account for the nonlinear interaction between cloud and water vapour ({cite.7.'Soden_and_Held_2006}). Moreover, it is now recognized that some of the cloud changes are induced directly by the atmospheric radiative effects of CO2 independently of surface warming, and are therefore rapid adjustments rather than feedbacks ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_6 Section 7.2.5.6}). Most of the published studies available for this assessment did not separate these effects, and only the total response is assessed here unless otherwise noted. It appears that the adjustments are sufficiently small in most models that general conclusions regarding feedbacks are not significantly affected.

Cloud changes cause both longwave (greenhouse warming) and shortwave (reflective cooling) effects, which combine to give the overall cloud feedback or {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} adjustment. {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback Cloud feedback} studies point to five aspects of the cloud response to climate change which are distinguished here: changes in high-level cloud altitude, effects of {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} and storm track changes on cloud systems, changes in low-level cloud amount, microphysically induced opacity (optical depth) changes and changes in high-latitude clouds. Finally, recent research on the rapid cloud adjustments to CO2 is assessed. Feedbacks involving aerosols ({Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_5 Section 7.3.5}) are not considered here, and the discussion focuses only on mechanisms affecting the TOA {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget}.
