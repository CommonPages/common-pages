title: 7.2.5.3 - Feedback Mechanisms Involving Low Cloud

Differences in the response of low clouds to a warming are responsible for most of the spread in model-based estimates of equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} ({cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2007}). Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} this finding has withstood further scrutiny (e.g., {cite.7.'Soden_and_Vecchi_2011}; {cite.7.'Webb_et_al_2013}), holds in CMIP5 models ({cite.7.'Vial_et_al_2013}) and has been shown to apply also to the transient {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} (e.g., {cite.7.'Dufresne_and_Bony_2008}). This discrepancy in responses occurs over most oceans and cannot be clearly confined to any single {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.7.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010}; {cite.7.'Webb_et_al_2013}), but is usually associated with the representation of shallow cumulus or stratocumulus clouds ({cite.7.'Williams_and_Tselioudis_2007}; {cite.7.'Williams_and_Webb_2009}; {cite.7.'Xu_et_al_2010}). Because the spread of responses emerges in a variety of idealized model formulations ({cite.7.'Medeiros_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Zhang_and_Bretherton_2008}; {cite.7.'Brient_and_Bony_2013}), or conditioned on a particular dynamical state ({cite.7.'Bony_et_al_2004}), and is similar in equilibrium or transient simulations ({cite.7.'Yokohata_et_al_2008}), it appears to be attributable to how cloud, convective and boundary layer processes are parameterized in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}.

The modelled response of low clouds does not appear to be dominated by a single {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} mechanism, but rather the net effect of several potentially competing mechanisms as elucidated in LES and GCM sensitivity studies (e.g., {cite.7.'Zhang_and_Bretherton_2008}; {cite.7.'Blossey_et_al_2013}; {cite.7.'Bretherton_et_al_2013}). Starting with some proposed negative feedback mechanisms, it has been argued that in a warmer climate, low clouds will be: (1) horizontally more extensive, because changes in the {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} of temperature also modify the lower-tropospheric stability ({cite.7.'Miller_1997}); (2) optically thicker, because adiabatic ascent is accompanied by a larger condensation rate ({cite.7.'Somerville_and_Remer_1984}); and (3) vertically more extensive, in response to a weakening of the tropical overturning circulation ({cite.7.'Caldwell_and_Bretherton_2009}). While these mechanisms may play some role in subtropical low cloud feedbacks, none of them appears dominant. Regarding (1), dry static stability alone is a misleading predictor with respect to climate changes, as models with comparably good simulations of the current regional distribution and/or relationship to stability of low cloud can produce a broad range of cloud responses to climate perturbations ({cite.7.'Wyant_et_al_2006}). Mechanism (2), discussed briefly in the next section, appears to have a small effect. Mechanism (3) cannot yet be ruled out but does not appear to be the dominant factor in determining subtropical cloud changes in {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} ({cite.7.'Bony_and_Dufresne_2005}; {cite.7.'Zhang_and_Bretherton_2008}).

Since the AR4, several new positive feedback mechanisms have been proposed, most associated with the marine boundary layer clouds thought to be at the core of the spread in responses. These include the ideas that: warming-induced changes in the absolute humidity lapse rate change the energetics of mixing in ways that demand a reduction in cloud amount or thickness ({cite.7.'Webb_and_Lock_2013}; {cite.7.'Bretherton_et_al_2013}; {cite.7.'Brient_and_Bony_2013}); energetic constraints prevent the surface evaporation from increasing with warming at a rate sufficient to balance expected changes in dry air entrainment, thereby reducing the supply of moisture to form clouds ({cite.7.'Rieck_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Webb_and_Lock_2013}); and that increased concentrations of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} reduce the radiative cooling that drives stratiform cloud layers and thereby the cloud amount ({cite.7.'Caldwell_and_Bretherton_2009}; {cite.7.'Stevens_and_Brenguier_2009}; {cite.7.'Bretherton_et_al_2013}). These mechanisms, crudely operating through parameterized representations of cloud processes, could explain why {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} consistently produce positive low-cloud feedbacks. Among CFMIP GCMs, the low-{Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} ranges from −0.09 to +0.63 W m–2 °C–1 ({'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10}), and is largely associated with a reduction in low-cloud amount, albeit with considerable spatial variability (e.g., {cite.7.'Webb_et_al_2013}). One ‘super-parameterized’ GCM ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2.7_2_2_2 Section 7.2.2.2}) simulates a negative low-cloud feedback ({cite.7.'Wyant_et_al_2006}, 2009), but that model’s representation of low clouds was worse than some conventional GCMs.

The tendency of both GCMs and process models to produce these positive feedback effects suggests that the feedback contribution from changes in low clouds is positive. However, deficient representation of low clouds in GCMs, diverse model results, a lack of reliable observational constraints, and the tentative nature of the suggested mechanisms leave us with low confidence in the sign of the low-cloud feedback contribution.
