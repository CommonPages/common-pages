title: 7.2.5.4 - Feedbacks Involving Changes in Cloud Opacity

It has long been suggested that cloud water content could increase in a warmer climate simply due to the availability of more vapour for condensation in a warmer {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, yielding a negative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({cite.7.'Paltridge_1980}; {cite.7.'Somerville_and_Remer_1984}), but this argument ignores the physics of crucial cloud-regulating processes such as precipitation formation and turbulence. Observational evidence discounting a large effect of this kind was reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2007}).

The global mean net feedback from cloud opacity changes in CFMIP models ({'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10}) is approximately zero. Optical depths tend to reduce slightly at low and middle latitudes, but increase poleward of 50°, yielding a positive longwave feedback that roughly offsets the negative shortwave feedback. These latitude-dependent opacity changes may be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to phase changes at high latitudes and greater poleward moisture transport ({cite.7.'Vavrus_et_al_2009}), and possibly to poleward shifts of the circulation.

Studies have reported warming-related changes in cloud opacity tied to cloud phase (e.g., {cite.7.'Senior_and_Mitchell_1993}; {cite.7.'Tsushima_et_al_2006}). This might be expected to cause negative feedback, because at mixedphase temperatures of –38 to 0°C, cloud ice particles have typical diameters of 10 to 100 μm (e.g., Figure 8 in {cite.7.'Donovan_2003}), several-fold larger than cloud water drops, so a given mass of cloud water would have less surface area and reflect less sunlight in ice form than in liquid form. As climate warms, a shift from ice to liquid at a given location could increase cloud opacity. An offsetting factor that may explain the absence of this in CFMIP, however, is that mixed-phase clouds may form at higher altitudes, and similar local temperatures, in warmer climates ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_1 Section 7.2.5.1}). The key physics is in any case not adequately represented in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. Thus this particular feedback mechanism is highly uncertain.
