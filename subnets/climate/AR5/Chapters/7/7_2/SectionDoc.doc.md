title: 7.2 - Clouds

This section summarizes our understanding of clouds in the current climate from observations and process models; advances in the representation of cloud processes in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}; assessment of cloud, water vapour and {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} feedbacks and adjustments; and the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} due to clouds induced by moisture released by two {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} processes (air traffic and irrigation). {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol}â€“cloud interactions are assessed in {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}. The fidelity of climate model simulations of clouds in the current climate is assessed in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}.
