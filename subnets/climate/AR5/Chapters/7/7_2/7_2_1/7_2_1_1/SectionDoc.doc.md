title: 7.2.1.1 - Cloud Formation, Cloud Types and Cloud Climatology

To form a cloud, air must cool or moisten until it is sufficiently supersaturated to activate some of the available condensation or freezing nuclei. Clouds may be composed of liquid water (possibly supercooled), ice or both (mixed phase). The nucleated cloud particles are initially very small, but grow by vapour deposition. Other microphysical mechanisms dependent on the cloud phase (e.g., droplet collision and coalescence for liquid clouds, riming and Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen processes for mixed-phase clouds and crystal aggregation in ice clouds) can produce a broader spectrum of particle sizes and types; turbulent mixing produces further variations in cloud properties on scales from kilometres to less than a centimetre ({cite.7.'Davis_et_al_1999}; {cite.7.'Bodenschatz_et_al_2010}). If and when some of the droplets or ice particles become large enough, these will fall out of the cloud as precipitation.

Atmospheric flows often organize {Glossary.*Convection convection} and associated clouds into coherent systems having scales from tens to thousands of kilometres, such as cyclones or frontal systems. These represent a significant modelling and theoretical challenge, as they are usually too large to represent within the limited domains of cloud-resolving models ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2.7_2_2_1 Section 7.2.2.1}), but are also not well resolved nor parameterized by most {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}; this gap, however, is beginning to close ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2.7_2_2_2 Section 7.2.2.2}). Finally, clouds and cloud systems are organized by larger-scale circulations into different regimes such as deep convection near the equator, subtropical marine stratocumulus, or mid-latitude {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} guided by the tropospheric westerly jets. {'Figure_7_4 Figure 7.4} shows a selection of widely occurring cloud regimes schematically and as they might appear in a typical geostationary satellite image.

New satellite sensors and new analysis of previous data sets have given us a clearer picture of the Earth’s clouds since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. A notable example is the launch in 2006 of two coordinated, active sensors, the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on the CloudSat satellite ({cite.7.'Stephens_et_al_2002}) and the Cloud–{Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on board the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite ({cite.7.'Winker_et_al_2009}). These sensors have significantly improved our ability to quantify vertical profiles of cloud occurrence and water content (see Figures {'Figure_7_5 7.5} and {'Figure_7_6 7.6}), and complement the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} capabilities of passive multispectral sensors (e.g., {cite.7.'Stubenrauch_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Chan_and_Comiso_2011}). Satellite cloud-observing capacities are reviewed by {cite.7.'Stubenrauch_et_al_2013 Stubenrauch et al. (2013)}.

Clouds cover roughly two thirds of the globe ({'Figure_7_5 Figure 7.5}a, c), with a more precise value depending on both the optical depth threshold used to define cloud and the spatial scale of measurement ({cite.7.'Wielicki_and_Parker_1992}; {cite.7.'Stubenrauch_et_al_2013}). The mid-latitude oceanic storm tracks and tropical precipitation belts are particularly cloudy, while continental desert regions and the central subtropical oceans are relatively cloud-free. Clouds are composed of liquid at temperatures above 0°C, ice below about –38°C (e.g., {cite.7.'Koop_et_al_2000}), and either or both phases at intermediate temperatures ({'Figure_7_5 Figure 7.5}b). Throughout most of the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, temperatures at any given altitude are usually warmer in the tropics, but clouds also extend higher there such that ice cloud amounts are no less than those at high latitudes. At any given time, most clouds are not precipitating ({'Figure_7_5 Figure 7.5}d).

In this chapter cloud above the 440 hPa pressure level is considered ‘high’, that below the 680 hPa level ‘low’, and that in-between is considered ‘mid-level’. Most high cloud (mainly cirrus and deep cumulus outflows) occurs near the equator and over tropical continents, but can also be seen in the mid-latitude storm track regions and over mid-latitude continents in summer ({'Figure_7_6 Figure 7.6}a, e); it is produced by the storms generating most of the global rainfall in regions where tropospheric air motion is upward, such that dynamical, rainfall and high-cloud fields closely resemble one another ({'Figure_7_6 Figure 7.6}d, h). Mid-level cloud ({'Figure_7_6 Figure 7.6}b, f), comprising a variety of types, is prominent in the storm tracks and some occurs in the Intertropical Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}). Low cloud ({'Figure_7_6 Figure 7.6}c, g), including shallow cumulus and stratiform cloud, occurs over essentially all oceans but is most prevalent over cooler subtropical oceans and in polar regions. It is less common over land, except at night and in winter.

Overlap between cloud layers has long been an issue both for satellite (or ground-based) detection and for calculating cloud radiative effects. Active sensors show more clearly that low clouds are prevalent in nearly all types of convective systems, and are often underestimated by models ({cite.7.'Chepfer_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Naud_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Haynes_et_al_2011}). Cloud layers at different levels overlap less often than typically assumed in General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}), especially over high-latitude continents and subtropical oceans ({cite.7.'Naud_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Mace_et_al_2009}), and the common assumption that the radiative effects of precipitating ice can be neglected is not necessarily warranted ({cite.7.'Waliser_et_al_2011}). New observations have led to revised treatments of overlap in some models, which significantly affects cloud radiative effects ({cite.7.'Pincus_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Shonk_et_al_2012}). Active sensors have also been useful in detecting low-lying Arctic clouds over {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} ({cite.7.'Kay_et_al_2008}), improving our ability to test climate model simulations of the interaction between sea ice loss and cloud cover ({cite.7.'Kay_et_al_2011}).
