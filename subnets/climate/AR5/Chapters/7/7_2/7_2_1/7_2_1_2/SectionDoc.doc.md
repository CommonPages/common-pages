title: 7.2.1.2 - Effects of Clouds on the Earth’s Radiation Budget

The effect of clouds on the Earth’s present-day top of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} (TOA) {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget}, or cloud {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} (CRE), can be inferred from satellite data by comparing upwelling radiation in cloudy and non-cloudy conditions ({cite.7.'Ramanathan_et_al_1989}). By enhancing the planetary {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}, cloudy conditions exert a global and annual shortwave {Glossary.*Cloud_radiative_effect cloud radiative effect} (SWCRE) of approximately –50 W m–2 and, by contributing to the {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect}, exert a mean longwave effect (LWCRE) of approximately +30 W m–2, with a range of 10% or less between published satellite estimates ({cite.7.'Loeb_et_al_2009}). Some of the apparent LWCRE comes from the enhanced water vapour coinciding with the natural cloud fluctuations used to measure the effect, so the true cloud LWCRE is about 10% smaller ({cite.7.'Sohn_et_al_2010}). The net global mean CRE of approximately –20 W m–2 implies a net cooling effect of clouds on the current climate. Owing to the large magnitudes of the SWCRE and LWCRE, clouds have the potential to cause significant climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5 Section 7.2.5}). The sign of this feedback on climate change cannot be determined from the sign of CRE in the current climate, but depends instead on how climate-sensitive the properties are that govern the LWCRE and SWCRE.

The regional patterns of annual-mean TOA CRE ({'Figure_7_7 Figure 7.7}a, b) reflect those of the altitude-dependent cloud distributions. High clouds, which are cold compared to the clear-sky radiating temperature, dominate patterns of LWCRE, while the SWCRE is sensitive to optically thick clouds at all altitudes. SWCRE also depends on the available sunlight, so for example is sensitive to the diurnal and seasonal cycles of cloudiness. Regions of deep, thick cloud with large positive LWCRE and large negative SWCRE tend to accompany precipitation ({'Figure_7_7 Figure 7.7}d), showing their intimate connection with the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle}. The net CRE is negative over most of the globe and most negative in regions of very extensive low-lying reflective stratus and stratocumulus cloud such as the mid-latitude and eastern subtropical oceans, where SWCRE is strong but LWCRE is weak ({'Figure_7_7 Figure 7.7}c). In these regions, the spatial distribution of net CRE on seasonal time scales correlates strongly with measures of low-level stability or inversion strength ({cite.7.'Klein_and_Hartmann_1993}; {cite.7.'Williams_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Wood_and_Bretherton_2006}; {cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2010}).

Clouds also exert a CRE at the surface and within the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, thus affecting the hydrological cycle and circulation ({Chapters.7.7_6 Section 7.6}), though this aspect of CRE has received less attention. The net downward flux of radiation at the surface is sensitive to the vertical and horizontal distribution of clouds. It has been estimated more accurately through radiation budget measurements and cloud profiling ({cite.7.'Kato_et_al_2011}). Based on these observations, the global mean surface downward longwave flux is about 10 W m–2 larger than the average in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, probably due to insufficient model-simulated cloud cover or lower tropospheric moisture ({cite.7.'Stephens_et_al_2012}). This is consistent with a global mean precipitation rate in the real world somewhat larger than current observational estimates.
