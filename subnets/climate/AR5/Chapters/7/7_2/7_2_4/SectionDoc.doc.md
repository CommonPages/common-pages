title: 7.2.4 - Water Vapour and Lapse Rate Feedbacks

Climate feedbacks determine the sensitivity of global {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} agents. Water vapour, {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} and cloud feedbacks each involve moist atmospheric processes closely linked to clouds, and in combination, produce most of the simulated climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} and most of its inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} ({Chapters.9.9_7 Section 9.7}). The radiative feedback from a given constituent can be quantified as its impact (other constituents remaining equal) on the TOA net downward radiative flux per degree of global surface (or near-surface) temperature increase, and may be compared with the basic ‘black-body’ response of −3.4 W m−2 °C−1 ({cite.7.'Hansen_et_al_1984}). This definition assigns positive values to positive feedbacks, in keeping with the literature on this topic but contradictory to the conventions sometimes adopted in other climate research.
