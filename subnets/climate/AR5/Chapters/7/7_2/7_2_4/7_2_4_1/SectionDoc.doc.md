title: 7.2.4.1 - Water Vapour Response and Feedback

As pointed out in previous reports (Section 8.6.3.1 in {cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2007}), physical arguments and models of all types suggest global water vapour amounts increase in a warmer climate, leading to a positive {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} via its enhanced {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect}. The saturated water vapour {Glossary.*Mixing_ratio mixing ratio} (WVMR) increases nearly exponentially and very rapidly with temperature, at 6 to 10% °C–1 near the surface, and even more steeply aloft (up to 17% °C–1) where air is colder. Mounting evidence indicates that any changes in {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} in warmer climates would have much less impact on {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} than the above increases, at least in a global and statistical sense. Hence the overall WVMR is expected to increase at a rate similar to the saturated WVMR.

Because global temperatures have been rising, the above arguments imply WVMR should be rising accordingly, and multiple observing systems indeed show this (Sections {Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_4 2.5.4} and {Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_5 2.5.5}). A study challenging the water vapour increase ({cite.7.'Paltridge_et_al_2009}) used an old {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} product, whose trends are contradicted by newer ones ({cite.7.'Dessler_and_Davis_2010}) and by actual observations ({Chapters.2 Chapter 2}). The study also reported decreasing relative humidity in data from Australian radiosondes, but more complete studies show Australia to be exceptional in this respect ({cite.7.'Dai_et_al_2011}). Thus data remain consistent with the expected global feedback.

Some studies have proposed that the response of upper-level humidity to natural fluctuations in the global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} is informative about the feedback. However, small changes to the global mean (primarily from {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}) involve geographically heterogeneous temperature change patterns, the responses to which may be a poor analogue for global warming ({cite.7.'Hurley_and_Galewsky_2010a}). Most {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} reproduce these natural responses reasonably well ({cite.7.'Gettelman_and_Fu_2008}; {cite.7.'Dessler_and_Wong_2009}), providing additional evidence that they at least represent the key processes.

The ‘last-saturation’ concept approximates the WVMR of air by its saturation value when it was last in a cloud (see {cite.7.'Sherwood_et_al_2010a} for a review), which can be inferred from trajectory analysis. Studies since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} using a variety of models and observations (including concentrations of water vapour {Glossary.*Isotopes isotopes}) support this concept ({cite.7.'Sherwood_and_Meyer_2006}; {cite.7.'Galewsky_and_Hurley_2010}). The concept has clarified what determines relative humidity in the subtropical upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and placed the water vapour feedback on firmer theoretical footing by directly linking actual and saturation WVMR values ({cite.7.'Hurley_and_Galewsky_2010b}). CRMs show that {Glossary.*Convection convection} can adopt varying degrees of self-aggregation (e.g., {cite.7.'Muller_and_Held_2012}), which could modify the water vapour or other feedbacks if this were climate sensitive, although observations do not suggest aggregation changes have a large net {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} ({cite.7.'Tobin_et_al_2012}).

In a warmer climate, an upward shift of the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} and poleward shift of the jets and associated climate zones are expected (Sections {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_4 2.7.4} and {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_5 2.7.5}) and simulated by most {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3 Section 10.3.3}). These changes account, at least qualitatively, for robust regional changes in the relative humidity simulated in warmer climate by {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs}, including decreases in the subtropical troposphere and tropical uppermost troposphere, and increases near the extratropical tropopause and high latitudes ({cite.7.'Sherwood_et_al_2010b}). This pattern may be amplified, however, by non-uniform atmospheric temperature or wind changes ({cite.7.'Hurley_and_Galewsky_2010b}). It is also the apparent cause of most model-{Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} changes in midand upper-level cloudiness patterns ({cite.7.'Wetherald_and_Manabe_1980}; {cite.7.'Sherwood_et_al_2010b}; see also {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_2 Section 7.2.5.2}). Idealized CRM simulations of warming climates also show upward shifts of the humidity patterns with little change in the mean (e.g., {cite.7.'Kuang_and_Hartmann_2007}; {cite.7.'Romps_2011}).

It remains unclear whether stratospheric water vapour contributes significantly to {Glossary.*Climate_feedback climate feedback}. Observations have shown decadal variations in stratospheric water vapour, which may have affected the planetary {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget} somewhat ({cite.7.'Solomon_et_al_2010}) but are not clearly linked to global temperature (Section 3.4.2.4 in {cite.7.'Trenberth_et_al_2007}). A strong positive feedback from stratospheric water vapour was reported in one GCM, but with parameter settings that produced an unrealistic present climate ({cite.7.'Joshi_et_al_2010}).
