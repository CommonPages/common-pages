title: 7.2.4.2 - Relationship Between Water Vapour and Lapse Rate Feedbacks

The {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} (decrease of temperature with altitude) should, in the tropics, change roughly as {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} by a moist adiabat, due to the strong restoring influence of convective heating. This restoring influence has now been directly inferred from satellite data ({cite.7.'Lebsock_et_al_2010}), and the near-constancy of tropical atmospheric stability and deep-convective thresholds over recent decades is also now observable in {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} and deep convective data ({cite.7.'Johnson_and_Xie_2010}). The stronger warming of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} relative to the surface produces a negative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} on global temperature because the warmed system radiates more thermal {Topics.*Emissions emission} to space for a given increase in {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} than in the reference case where the lapse rate is fixed. This feedback varies somewhat among models because lapse rates in middle and high latitudes, which decrease less than in the tropics, do so differently among models ({cite.7.'Dessler_and_Wong_2009}).

As shown by {cite.7.'Cess_1975 Cess (1975)} and discussed in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.7.'Randall_et_al_2007}), models with a more negative lapse rate feedback tend to have a more positive water vapour feedback. Cancellation between these is close enough that their sum has a 90% range in CMIP3 models of only +0.96 to +1.22 W m−2 °C−1 (based on a Gaussian fit to the data of {cite.7.'Held_and_Shell_2012 Held and Shell (2012)}, see {'Figure_7_9 Figure 7.9}) with essentially the same range in CMIP5 ({Chapters.9.9_7 Section 9.7}). The physical reason for this cancellation is that as long as water vapour infrared absorption bands are nearly saturated, outgoing {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation} is determined by {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} ({cite.7.'Ingram_2010}) which exhibits little global systematic change in any model ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_4.7_2_4_1 Section 7.2.4.1}). In fact, {cite.7.'Held_and_Shell_2012 Held and Shell (2012)} and {cite.7.'Ingram_2013a Ingram (2013a)} argue that it makes more sense physically to redefine feedbacks in a different analysis framework in which relative humidity, rather than {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity}, is the feedback variable. Analysed in that framework the inherent stabilization by the Planck response is weaker, but the water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks are also very small; thus the traditional view of large and partially compensating feedbacks has, arguably, arisen from arbitrary choices made when the analysis framework was originally set out, rather than being an intrinsic feature of climate or {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}.

There is some observational evidence ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4 Section 2.4.4}) suggesting tropical lapse rates might have increased in recent decades in a way not simulated by models ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_4.9_4_1_4_2 Section 9.4.1.4.2}). Because the combined lapse rate and water vapour feedback depends on relative humidity change, however, the imputed lapse rate variations would have little influence on the total feedback or {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} even if they were a real warming response ({cite.7.'Ingram_2013b}). In summary, there is increased evidence for a strong, positive feedback (measured in the traditional framework) from the combination of water vapour and lapse rate changes since AR4, with no reliable contradictory evidence.
