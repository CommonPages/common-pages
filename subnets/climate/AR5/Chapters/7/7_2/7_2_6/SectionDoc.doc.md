title: 7.2.6 - Feedback Synthesis

Together, the water vapour, {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} and cloud feedbacks are the principal determinants of equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity}. The water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks, as traditionally defined, should be thought of as a single phenomenon rather than in isolation (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_4.7_2_4_2 Section 7.2.4.2}). To estimate a 90% probability range for that {Glossary.*Feedback feedback}, we double the variance of GCM results about the mean to account for the possibility of errors common to all models, to arrive at +1.1 (+0.9 to +1.3) W m−2 °C−1. Values in this range are supported by a steadily growing body of observational evidence, model tests, and physical reasoning. As a corollary, the net feedback from water vapour and lapse rate changes combined is extremely likely positive, allowing for the possibility of deep {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} or a fat-tailed error distribution. Key aspects of the responses of water vapour and clouds to climate warming now appear to be constrained by large-scale dynamical mechanisms that are not sensitive to poorly represented small-scale processes, and as such, are more credible. This feedback is thus known to be positive with high confidence, and contributes only a small part of the spread in GCM climate sensitivity ({Chapters.9.9_7 Section 9.7}). An alternative framework has recently been proposed in which these feedbacks, and stabilization via thermal {Topics.*Emissions emission}, are all significantly smaller and more consistent among models; thus the range given above may overstate the true uncertainty.

Several {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} mechanisms now appear consistently in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}, summarized in {'Figure_7_11 Figure 7.11}, most supported by other lines of evidence. Nearly all act in a positive direction. First, high clouds are expected to rise in altitude and thereby exert a stronger {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect} in warmer climates. This altitude feedback mechanism is well understood, has theoretical and observational support, occurs consistently in {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} and CRMs and explains about half of the mean positive cloud feedback in GCMs. Second, middle and high-level cloud cover tends to decrease in warmer climates even within the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}, although the feedback effect of this is ambiguous and it cannot yet be tested observationally. Third, observations and most models suggest {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} shift poleward in a warmer climate, drying the subtropics and moistening the high latitudes, which causes further positive feedback via a net shift of cloud cover to latitudes that receive less sunshine. Finally, most GCMs also predict that low cloud amount decreases, especially in the subtropics, another {Glossary.*Source source} of positive feedback though one that differs significantly among models and lacks a well-accepted theoretical basis. Over middle and high latitudes, GCMs suggest warming-induced transitions from ice to water clouds may cause clouds to become more opaque, but this appears to have a small systematic net {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} in models, possibly because it is offset by cloud altitude changes.

Currently, neither cloud process models (CRMs and LES) nor observations provide clear evidence to contradict or confirm feedback mechanisms involving low clouds. In some cases these models show stronger low-cloud feedbacks than GCMs, but each model type has limitations, and some studies suggest stronger positive feedbacks are more realistic ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_7 Section 7.2.5.7}). Cloud process models suggest a variety of potentially opposing response mechanisms that may account for the current spread of GCM feedbacks. In summary we find no evidence to contradict either the cloud or water vapour–lapse rate feedback ranges shown by current GCMs, although the many uncertainties mean that true feedback could still lie outside these ranges. In particular, microphysical mechanisms affecting cloud opacity or cirrus amount may well be missing from GCMs. Missing feedbacks, if any, could act in either direction.

Based on the preceding synthesis of cloud behaviour, the net radiative feedback due to all cloud types is judged likely to be positive. This is reasoned probabilistically as follows. First, because evidence from observations and process models is mixed as to whether GCM cloud feedback is too strong or too weak overall, and because the positive feedback found in GCMs comes mostly from mechanisms now supported by other lines of evidence, the central (most likely) estimate of the total cloud feedback is taken as the mean from GCMs (+0.6 W m–2 °C–1). Second, because there is no accepted basis to discredit individual GCMs a priori, the probability distribution of the true feedback cannot be any narrower than the distribution of GCM results. Third, since feedback mechanisms are probably missing from GCMs and some CRMs suggest feedbacks outside the range in GCMs, the probable range of the feedback must be broader than its spread in GCMs. We estimate a probability distribution for this feedback by doubling the spread about the mean of all model values in {'Figure_7_10 Figure 7.10} (in effect assuming an additional uncertainty about 1.7 times as large as that encapsulated in the GCM range, added to it in quadrature). This yields a 90% (very likely) range of −0.2 to +2.0 W m–2 °C–1, with a 17% probability of a negative feedback.

Note that the assessment of feedbacks in this chapter is independent of constraints on climate sensitivity from observed trends or palaeoclimate information discussed in {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}.
