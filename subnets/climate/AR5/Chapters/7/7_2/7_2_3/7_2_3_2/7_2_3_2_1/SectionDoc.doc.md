title: 7.2.3.2.1 - Liquid clouds

Recent development efforts have been focused on the introduction of more complex representations of microphysical processes, with the dual goals of coupling them better to atmospheric aerosols and linking them more consistently to the sub-grid variability assumed by the model for other calculations. For example, most CMIP3 {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} the average cloud and rain {Glossary.*Water_mass water mass} in each grid cell only at a given time, diagnosing the droplet concentration using empirical relationships based on {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} mass (e.g., {cite.7.'Boucher_and_Lohmann_1995}; {cite.7.'Menon_et_al_2002}), or altitude and proximity to land. Many were forced to employ an arbitrary lower bound on droplet concentration to reduce the aerosol {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} ({cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2009}). Such formulations oversimplify microphysically mediated cloud variations.

By contrast, more models participating in CMIP5 predict both mass and number mixing ratios for liquid stratiform cloud. Some determine rain and snow number concentrations and mixing ratios (e.g., {cite.7.'Morrison_and_Gettelman_2008}; {cite.7.'Salzmann_et_al_2010}), allowing treatment of aerosol scavenging and the {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} of snow. Some models explicitly treat sub-grid cloud water variability for calculating microphysical process rates (e.g., {cite.7.'Morrison_and_Gettelman_2008}). Cloud droplet activation schemes now account more realistically for particle composition, mixing and size (Abdul-Razzak and Ghan, 2000; {cite.7.'Ghan_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Liu_et_al_2012}). Despite such advances in internal consistency, a continuing weakness in {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} (and to a much lesser extent GCRMs and super-parameterized models) is their inability to fully represent turbulent motions to which microphysical processes are highly sensitive.
