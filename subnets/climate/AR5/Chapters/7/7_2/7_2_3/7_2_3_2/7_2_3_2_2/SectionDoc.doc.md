title: 7.2.3.2.2 - Mixed-phase and ice clouds

Ice treatments are following a path similar to those for liquid water, and face similar but greater challenges because of the greater complexity of ice processes. Many CMIP3 models {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} the condensed water amount in just two categories—cloud and precipitation—with a temperature-dependent partitioning between liquid and ice within either category. Although supersaturation with respect to ice is commonly observed at low temperatures, only one CMIP3 {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} (ECHAM) allowed ice supersaturation (Lohmann and Kärcher, 2002).

Many climate models now include separate, physically based equations for cloud liquid versus cloud ice, and for rain versus snow, allowing a more realistic treatment of mixed-phase processes and ice supersaturation ({cite.7.'Liu_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Tompkins_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Gettelman_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Salzmann_et_al_2010}; see also {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 Section 7.4.4}). These new schemes are tested in a single-column model against cases observed in field campaigns (e.g., {cite.7.'Klein_et_al_2009}) or against satellite observations (e.g., {cite.7.'Kay_et_al_2012}), and provide superior simulations of cloud structure than typical CMIP3 parameterizations ({cite.7.'Kay_et_al_2012}). However new observations reveal complexities not correctly captured by even relatively advanced schemes ({cite.7.'Ma_et_al_2012a}). New representations of the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process in mixed-phase clouds ({cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2008b}; {cite.7.'Lohmann_and_Hoose_2009}) compare the rate at which the pre-existing ice crystals deplete the water vapour with the condensation rate for liquid water driven by vertical updraught speed ({cite.7.'Korolev_2007}); these are not yet included in CMIP5 models. {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} are increasingly representing detailed microphysics, including mixed-phase processes, inside convective clouds ({cite.7.'Fowler_and_Randall_2002}; {cite.7.'Lohmann_2008}; {cite.7.'Song_and_Zhang_2011}). Such processes can influence storm characteristics like strength and electrification, and are crucial for fully representing {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions, but are still not included in most climate models; their representation is moreover subject to all the caveats noted in {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_3.7_2_3_1 Section 7.2.3.1}.
