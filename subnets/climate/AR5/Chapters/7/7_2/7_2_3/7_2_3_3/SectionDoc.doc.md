title: 7.2.3.3 - Recent Advances in Parameterizing Moist Turbulence and Convection

Both the mean state and variability in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} are sensitive to the {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of cumulus {Glossary.*Convection convection}. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the development of convective parameterization has been driven largely by rapidly growing use of process models, in particular LES and CRMs, to inform parameterization development (e.g., {cite.7.'Hourdin_et_al_2013}).

Accounting for greater or more state-dependent entrainment of air into deep cumulus updraughts has improved simulations of the Madden– Julian Oscillation, tropical convectively coupled waves and mean rainfall patterns in some models ({cite.7.'Bechtold_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Song_and_Zhang_2009}; {cite.7.'Chikira_and_Sugiyama_2010}; {cite.7.'Hohenegger_and_Bretherton_2011}; {cite.7.'Mapes_and_Neale_2011}; Del Genio et al., 2012; {cite.7.'Kim_et_al_2012}) but usually at the expense of a degraded simulation of the mean state. In another model, revised criteria for convective initiation and parameterizations of cumulus momentum fluxes improved {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and tropical vertical temperature profiles ({cite.7.'Neale_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Richter_and_Rasch_2008}). Since AR4, more climate models have adopted cumulus parameterizations that diagnose the expected vertical velocity in cumulus updraughts (e.g., Del Genio et al., 2007; {cite.7.'Park_and_Bretherton_2009}; {cite.7.'Chikira_and_Sugiyama_2010}; {cite.7.'Donner_et_al_2011}), in principle allowing more complete representations of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} activation, cloud microphysical evolution and gravity wave generation by the convection.

Several new parameterizations couple shallow cumulus convection more closely to moist boundary layer turbulence ({cite.7.'Siebesma_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Neggers_2009}; {cite.7.'Neggers_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Couvreux_et_al_2010}) including cold pools generated by nearby deep convection ({cite.7.'Grandpeix_and_Lafore_2010}). Many of these efforts have led to more accurate simulations of boundary-layer cloud radiative properties and vertical structure (e.g., {cite.7.'Park_and_Bretherton_2009}; Köhler et al., 2011), and have ameliorated the common problem of premature deep convective initiation over land in one CMIP5 {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} ({cite.7.'Rio_et_al_2009}).
