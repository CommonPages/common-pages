title: 7.2.3.4 - Recent Advances in Parameterizing Cloud Radiative Effects

Some models have improved representation of sub-grid scale cloud variability, which has important effects on grid-mean radiative fluxes and precipitation fluxes, for example, based on the use of probability density functions of thermodynamic variables ({cite.7.'Sommeria_and_Deardorff_1977}; {cite.7.'Watanabe_et_al_2009}). Stochastic approaches for radiative transfer can account for this variability in a computationally efficient way ({cite.7.'Barker_et_al_2008}). New treatments of cloud overlap have been motivated by new observations ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_1.7_2_1_1 Section 7.2.1.1}). Despite these advances, the CMIP5 models continue to exhibit the ‘too few, too bright’ low-cloud problem ({cite.7.'Nam_et_al_2012}), with a systematic overestimation of cloud optical depth and underestimation of cloud cover.
