title: 7.2.3.5 - Cloud Modelling Synthesis

Global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} used in CMIP5 have improved their representation of cloud processes relative to CMIP3, but still face challenges and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, especially regarding details of small-scale variability that are crucial for {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}â€“cloud interactions (see {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}). Finerscale LES and CRM models are much better able to represent this variability and are an important research tool, but still suffer from imperfect representations of aerosol and cloud microphysics and known biases. Most CRM and LES studies do not span the large space and time scales needed to fully determine the interactions among different cloud regimes and the resulting net planetary radiative effects. Thus our assessments in this chapter do not regard any model type on its own as definitive, but weigh the implications of process model studies in assessing the quantitative results of the global models.
