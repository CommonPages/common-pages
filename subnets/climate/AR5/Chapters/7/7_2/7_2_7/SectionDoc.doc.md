title: 7.2.7 - Anthropogenic Sources of Moisture and Cloudiness

Human activity can be a {Glossary.*Source source} of additional cloudiness through specific processes involving a source of water vapour in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. We discuss here the impact of aviation and irrigation on water vapour and cloudiness. The impact of water vapour sources from combustion at the Earthâ€™s surface is thought to be negligible. Changes to the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} because of {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} are briefly discussed in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_8 Section 12.4.8}.
