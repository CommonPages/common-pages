title: 7.2.7.2 - Irrigation-Induced Cloudiness

{cite.7.'Boucher_et_al_2004 Boucher et al. (2004)} estimated a global {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} due to water vapour from irrigation in the range of +0.03 to +0.10 W m–2 but the net climate effect was dominated by the evaporative cooling at the surface and by atmospheric thermal responses to low-level humidification. Regional surface cooling was confirmed by a number of more recent regional and global studies ({cite.7.'Kueppers_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Lobell_et_al_2009}). The resulting increase in water vapour may induce a small enhancement in precipitation downwind of the major irrigation areas ({cite.7.'Puma_and_Cook_2010}), as well as some regional circulation patterns ({cite.7.'Kueppers_et_al_2007}). {cite.7.'Sacks_et_al_2009 Sacks et al. (2009)} reported a 0.001 increase in cloud fraction over land (0.002 over irrigated land). This suggests an ERF no more negative than –0.1 W m–2 with very low confidence.
