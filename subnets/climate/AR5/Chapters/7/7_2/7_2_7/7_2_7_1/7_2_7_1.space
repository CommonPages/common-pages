title: 7.2.7.1 - Contrails and Contrail-Induced Cirrus
section 7_2_7_1

  |Aviation jet engines emit hot moist air, which can form line shaped persistent condensation trails (contrails). We assess the combined contrail and contrail-induced cirrus {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} for the year 2011 to be +0.05 (+0.02 to +0.15) W mâ€“2. A low confidence is attached to this estimate.
