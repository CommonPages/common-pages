title: 7.7.1 - Introduction

{Glossary.*Geoengineering Geoengineering}—also called climate engineering—is defined as a broad set of methods and technologies that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate impacts of climate change ({cite.7.'Keith_2000}; {cite.7.'Izrael_et_al_2009}; Royal Society, 2009; {cite.7.'IPCC_2011}). Two main classes of geoengineering are often considered. Solar Radiation Management ({Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM}) proposes to counter the warming associated with increasing GHG concentrations by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed at the surface. A related method seeks to alter high-altitude cirrus clouds to reduce their {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect}. Another class of geoengineering called Carbon Dioxide Removal ({Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal CDR}) is discussed in {Chapters.6.6_5 Section 6.5}. This section assesses how the climate system might respond to some proposed SRM methods and related methods thought to have the potential to influence the global {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} by at least a few tenths of a W m–2 but it does not assess technological or economical feasibility, or consider methods targeting specific climate impacts ({cite.7.'MacCracken_2009}). Geoengineering is quite a new field of research, and there are relatively few studies focussed on it. Assessment of SRM is limited by (1) gaps in understanding of some important processes; (2) a relative scarcity of studies; and (3) a scarcity of studies using similar experimental design. This section discusses some aspects of SRM potential to mitigate global warming, outlines robust conclusions where they are apparent, and evaluates {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and potential side effects. Additional impacts of SRM are assessed in Section 19.5.4 of the WGII report, while some of the socio-economic issues are assessed in Chapters 3, 6 and 13 of the WGIII report.
