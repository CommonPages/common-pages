title: 7.7.3 - Climate Response to Solar Radiation Management Methods

As discussed elsewhere in this and other chapters of this assessment, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} mechanisms. {Glossary.*Geoengineering Geoengineering} is also a relatively new field of research. The gaps in understanding, scarcity of studies and diversity in the model experimental design make quantitative model evaluation and intercomparison difficult, hindering an assessment of the {Glossary.*Efficacy efficacy} and side effects of {Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM}. This motivates dividing the discussion into two sections, one that assesses idealized studies that focus on conceptual issues and searches for robust responses to simple changes in the balance between solar irradiance and {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} forcing, and another discussing studies that more closely emulate specific SRM methods.
