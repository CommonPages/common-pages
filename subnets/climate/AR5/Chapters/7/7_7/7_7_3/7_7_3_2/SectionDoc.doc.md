title: 7.7.3.2 - Climate Response to Specific Solar Radiation Management Methods

Several studies examined the model response to more realistic stratospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM} ({cite.7.'Rasch_et_al_2008b}; {cite.7.'Robock_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Jones_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Fyfe_et_al_2013}). These studies produced varying aerosol {Glossary.*Burden burdens}, and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} and model responses also varied more strongly than in idealized experiments. Although these studies differ in details, their climate responses were generally consistent with the idealized experiments described in {Chapters.7.7_7.7_7_3.7_7_3_1 Section 7.7.3.1}.

Studies treating the interaction between the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, the hydrologic cycle, and SRM indicate that SRM could affect the temperature driven suppression of some carbon sinks, and that the increased stomatal resistance with increased {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations combined with less warming, may further affect the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} over land ({cite.7.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007}; {cite.7.'Fyfe_et_al_2013}), with larger impacts on precipitation for stratospheric aerosol SRM than for a uniform reduction in incoming sunlight.

Coupled ocean–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–{Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} models have also been used to assess the climate impacts of cloud brightening due to droplet concentration changes ({cite.7.'Jones_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Rasch_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Baughman_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Hill_and_Ming_2012}). The patterns of temperature and precipitation change differ substantially between models. These studies showed larger residual temperature changes than the idealized SRM studies, with more pronounced cooling over the regions of enhanced {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}. The cooling over the seeded regions (the marine stratocumulus regions) and a warmer North Pacific adjacent to a cooler northwestern Canada, produced a {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} response with a {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña}-like pattern. One study has noted regional shifts in the potential hurricane intensity and hurricane genesis potential index in the Atlantic Ocean and South China Sea in response to cloud brightening ({cite.7.'Baughman_et_al_2012}), due primarily to decreases in vertical wind shear, but overall the investigation and identification of robust side effects has not been extensively explored.

{cite.7.'Irvine_et_al_2011 Irvine et al. (2011)} tested the impact of increasing desert albedo up to 0.80 in a {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model}. This cooled {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} by –1.1°C (versus –0.22°C and –0.11°C for their largest crop and urban albedo change) and produced very significant changes in regional precipitation patterns.
