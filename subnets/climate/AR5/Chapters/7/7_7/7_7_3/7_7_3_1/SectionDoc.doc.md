title: 7.7.3.1 - Climate Response in Idealized Studies

Perhaps the simplest {Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM} experiment that can be performed in a {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} consists of a specified reduction of the total solar irradiance, which could approximate the radiative impact of space reflectors. Reductions in solar irradiance in particular regions (over land or ocean, or in polar or tropical regions) could also provide useful information. Idealized simulations often focus on the effects of a complete cancellation of the warming from {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, but the rate of warming is occasionally explored by producing a negative RF that partially cancels the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} (e.g., {cite.7.'Eliseev_et_al_2009}). They can also provide insight into the {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} to other SRM methods, and can provide a simple baseline for examining other SRM techniques.

The most comprehensive and systematic evaluation of idealized SRM to date is the {Glossary.*Geoengineering Geoengineering} {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project ({cite.7.'Kravitz_et_al_2011}). Together with earlier model studies, this project found robust {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} reductions when the total solar irradiance is reduced: when this reduction compensates for {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} RF, residual effects appear regionally, but they are much smaller than the warming due to the CO2 RF alone ({cite.7.'Kravitz_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Schmidt_et_al_2012b}; {'Figure_7_22 Figures 7.22}a, b and 7.23a–d) The substantial warming from 4 × CO2 at high latitudes (4°C to 18°C) is reduced to a warming of 0°C to 3°C near the winter pole. The residual {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} changes are generally positive at midand high-latitudes, especially over continents, and generally negative in the tropics ({cite.7.'Bala_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Lunt_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Schmidt_et_al_2012b}). These anomalies can be understood in terms of the difference between the more uniform longwave forcing associated with changes in long-lived GHGs and the less uniform shortwave forcing from SRM that has a stronger variation in latitude and season. The compensation between SRM and CO2 forcing is inexact in other ways.

For example, SRM will change heating rates only during daytime, but increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect} changes temperatures during both day and night, influencing the diurnal cycle of surface temperature even if compensation for the diurnally averaged surface temperature is correct.

Although increasing CO2 concentrations lead to a positive RF that warms the entire {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, SRM produces a negative RF that tends to cool the surface. The combination of RFs produces an increase in stability that leads to less global precipitation as seen in {'Figure_7_22 Figures 7.22}c, d and 7.23e–g ({cite.7.'Bala_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Andrews_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Schmidt_et_al_2012b}) and discussed in {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_3 Section 7.6.3}. The reduction in precipitation shows similarities to the climate response induced by the Pinatubo eruption ({cite.7.'Trenberth_and_Dai_2007}). Although the impact of changes in the total solar irradiance on global mean precipitation is well understood and robust in models, there is less understanding and agreement among models in the spatial pattern of the precipitation changes. Modelling studies suggest that some residual patterns may be robust (e.g., approximately 5% reduction in precipitation over Southeast Asia and the Pacific Warm Pool in June, July and August), but a physical explanation for these changes is lacking. Some model results indicate that an asymmetric hemispheric SRM forcing would induce changes in some regional precipitation patterns ({cite.7.'Haywood_et_al_2013}).

High CO2 concentrations from {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} will persist in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} for more than a thousand years in the absence of active efforts to remove atmospheric CO2 (see {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}). If SRM were used to counter positive forcing, it would be needed as long as the CO concentrations remained high ({cite.7.'Boucher_et_al_2009}). If GHG concentrations continued to increase, then the scale of SRM to offset the resulting warming would need to increase proportionally, amplifying residual effects from increasingly imperfect compensation. {'Figure_7_24 Figure 7.24} shows {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the globally averaged surface temperature and precipitation changes associated with a 1% yr–1 CO2 increase, with and without SRM. The scenario includes a hypothetical, abrupt termination of SRM at year 50, which could happen due to any number of unforeseeable circumstances. After this event, all the simulations predict a return to temperature levels consistent with the CO2 forcing within one to two decades (high confidence), and with a large rate of temperature change (see also {cite.7.'Irvine_et_al_2012}). Precipitation, which drops by 1% over the SRM period, rapidly returns to levels consistent with the CO2 forcing upon SRM termination. The very rapid warming would probably affect {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} and human adaptation, and would also weaken carbon sinks, accelerating atmospheric CO2 {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} and contributing to further warming ({cite.7.'Matthews_and_Caldeira_2007}).

Research suggests that this ‘termination effect’ might be avoided if SRM were used at a modest level and for a relatively short period of time (less than a century) when combined with aggressive CO2 removal efforts to minimize the probability that the global mean temperature might exceed some threshold ({cite.7.'Matthews_2010}; {cite.7.'Smith_and_Rasch_2012}).
