title: 7.7.2.3 - Surface Albedo Changes

A few studies have explored how planetary {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} might be increased by engineering local changes to the albedo of urban areas, croplands, grasslands, deserts and the ocean surface. Effects from whitening of urban areas have been estimated to yield a potential {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} of –0.17 W m–2 ({cite.7.'Hamwey_2007}) although subsequent studies ({cite.7.'Lenton_and_Vaughan_2009}; {cite.7.'Oleson_et_al_2010}; Jacobson and Ten Hoeve, 2012) suggest that this estimate may be at the upper end of what is achievable. Larger effects might be achievable by replacing native grassland or cropland with natural or bioengineered species with a larger albedo. A hypothetical 25% increase in grassland albedo could yield a RF as large as –0.5 W m–2 ({cite.7.'Lenton_and_Vaughan_2009}), with the maximum effect in the mid-latitudes during summer ({cite.7.'Ridgwell_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Doughty_et_al_2011}). The feasibility of increasing crop and grassland albedo remains unknown, and there could be side effects on photosynthetic activity, carbon {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} and biodiversity. The low albedo and large extent of oceanic surfaces mean that only a small increase in albedo, for example, by increasing the concentration of microbubbles in the {Glossary.*Surface_layer surface layer} of the ocean ({cite.7.'Evans_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Seitz_2011}), could be sufficient to offset several W m–2 of RF by {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}. Neither the extent of microbubble generation and persistence required for a significant climate impact, nor the potential side effects on the ocean circulation, air-sea fluxes and marine ecosystems have been assessed.
