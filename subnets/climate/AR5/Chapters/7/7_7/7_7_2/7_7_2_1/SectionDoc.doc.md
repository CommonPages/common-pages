title: 7.7.2.1 - Stratospheric Aerosols

Some {Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM} methods propose increasing the amount of stratospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} to produce a cooling effect like that observed after strong explosive volcanic eruptions ({cite.7.'Budyko_1974}; {cite.7.'Crutzen_2006}). Recent studies have used numerical simulations and/or natural analogues to explore the possibility of forming sulphuric acid aerosols by injecting sulphur-containing gases into the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} ({cite.7.'Rasch_et_al_2008b}). Because aerosols eventually sediment out of the stratosphere (within roughly a year or less), these methods require replenishment to maintain a given level of RF. Research has also begun to explore the {Glossary.*Efficacy efficacy} of other types of aerosol particles ({cite.7.'Crutzen_2006}; {cite.7.'Keith_2010}; {cite.7.'Ferraro_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Kravitz_et_al_2012}) but the literature is much more limited and not assessed here.

The RF depends on the choice of chemical species (gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2), sulphuric acid (H2SO4) or sprayed aerosols), location(s), rate and frequency of injection. The injection strategy affects particle size ({cite.7.'Rasch_et_al_2008a}; {cite.7.'Heckendorn_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Pierce_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'English_et_al_2012}), with larger particles producing less RF (per unit mass) and more rapid sedimentation than smaller particles, affecting the efficacy of the method. The aerosol size distribution is controlled by an evolving balance between new particle formation, condensation of vapour on pre-existing particles, evaporation of particles, coagulation and sedimentation. Models that more fully account for aerosol processes ({cite.7.'Heckendorn_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Pierce_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'English_et_al_2012}) found smaller aerosol {Glossary.*Burden burdens}, larger particles and weaker RF than earlier studies that prescribed the particle size over the particle {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime}. Current modeling studies indicate that injection of sulphate aerosol {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} of at least 10 Mt S (approximately the amount of sulphur injected by the Mount Pinatubo eruption) would be needed annually to maintain a RF of –4 W m–2, roughly equal but opposite to that associated with a doubling of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({cite.7.'Heckendorn_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Pierce_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Niemeier_et_al_2011}). Stratospheric aerosols may affect high clouds in the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, and one study ({cite.7.'Kuebbeler_et_al_2012}) suggests significant negative {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} would result, but this is uncertain given limited understanding of ice nucleation in high clouds ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4.7_4_4_4 Section 7.4.4.4}).

Along with its potential to mitigate some aspects of global warming, the potential side effects of SRM must also be considered. Tilmes et al. (2008; 2009) estimated that stratospheric aerosols SRM might increase chemical {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} loss at high latitudes and delay recovery of the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ozone_hole ozone hole} (expected at the end of this century) by 30 to 70 years, with changes in column ozone of –3 to –10% in polar latitudes and +3 to +5% in the tropics. A high latitude ozone loss is expected to increase UV radiation reaching the surface there, although the effect would be partially compensated by the increase in attenuation by the aerosol itself ({cite.7.'Vogelmann_et_al_1992}; {cite.7.'Tilmes_et_al_2012}). A decrease in direct radiation and increase in diffuse radiation reaching the Earth’s surface would occur and would be expected to increase {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} in terrestrial ecosystems ({cite.7.'Mercado_et_al_2009}; see {Chapters.6.6_5.6_5_4 Section 6.5.4}) and decrease the efficiency of some solar energy technologies (see WGII AR5, Section 19.5.4). Models indicate that stratospheric aerosol SRM would not pose a surface acidification threat with maximum acid deposition rates estimated to be at least 500 times less than the threshold of concern for the most sensitive land ecosystems ({cite.7.'Kuylenstierna_et_al_2001}; {cite.7.'Kravitz_et_al_2009}); contributions to {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} are also estimated to represent a very small fraction of that induced by {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 {Topics.*Emissions emissions} ({cite.7.'Kravitz_et_al_2009}). There are other known side effects that remain unquantified, and limited understanding (and limited study) make additional impacts difficult to anticipate.
