title: 7.7.2.2 - Cloud Brightening

Boundary layer clouds act to cool the planet, and relatively small changes in {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} or areal extent of low cloud can have profound effects on the Earth’s {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget} ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_1 Section 7.2.1}). Theoretical, modelling and observational studies show that the albedo of these types of cloud systems are susceptible to changes in their droplet concentrations, but the {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and quantification of RF attributable to such effects is difficult to separate from meteorological variability ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3.7_4_3_2 Section 7.4.3.2}). Nonetheless, by systematically introducing {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} into the marine boundary layer, it should be possible to locally increase boundary layer cloud albedo as discussed in {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_2 Section 7.4.2}. These ideas underpin the method of cloud brightening, for instance through the direct injection (seeding) of sea-spray particles into cloud-forming air masses ({cite.7.'Latham_1990}). An indirect cloud brightening mechanism through enhanced DMS production has also been proposed ({cite.7.'Wingenter_et_al_2007}) but the {Glossary.*Efficacy efficacy} of the DMS mechanism is disputed ({cite.7.'Vogt_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Woodhouse_et_al_2008}).

The seeding of cloud layers with a propensity to precipitate may change cloud structure (e.g., from open to closed cells) and/or increase liquid water content ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3.7_4_3_2.7_4_3_2_1 Section 7.4.3.2.1}), in either case changing albedo and producing strong negative {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. A variety of methods have been used to identify which cloud regions are most susceptible to an {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} change ({cite.7.'Oreopoulos_and_Platnick_2008}; {cite.7.'Salter_et_al_2008}; Alterskjær et al., 2012). Marine stratocumulus clouds with relatively weak precipitation are thought to be an optimal cloud type for brightening because of their relatively low droplet concentrations, their expected increase in cloud water in response to seeding ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3.7_4_3_2.7_4_3_2_1 Section 7.4.3.2.1}), and the longer {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of sea salt particles in nonor weakly precipitating environments. Relatively strong local {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} (–30 to –100 W m–2) would be required to produce a global forcing of –1 to –5 W m–2 if only the more susceptible clouds were seeded.

Simple modelling studies suggest that increasing droplet concentrations in marine boundary layer clouds by a factor of five or so (to concentrations of 375 to 1000 cm–3) could produce an ERFaci of about –1 W m–2 if 5% of the ocean surface area were seeded, and an ERFaci as strong as –4 W m–2 if that fraction were increased to 75% ({cite.7.'Latham_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Jones_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Rasch_et_al_2009}). Subsequent studies with more complete treatments of aerosol–cloud interactions have produced both stronger (Alterskjær et al., 2012; {cite.7.'Partanen_et_al_2012}) and weaker ({cite.7.'Korhonen_et_al_2010a}) changes. Because the initial response to cloud seeding is local, high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution}, limited-domain simulations are especially useful to explore the efficacy of seeding. One recent study of this type ({cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011a}) found that cloud brightening is sensitive to cloud dynamical adjustments that are difficult to treat in current {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} (Sections {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_3 7.4.3} and {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_3 7.5.3}) and concluded that the seeding rates initially proposed for cloud seeding may be insufficient to produce the desired cloud brightening. Recent studies accounting for clear-sky brightening from increased aerosol concentrations (i.e., {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari}) also found an increase in the amplitude of the {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} by 30 to 50% ({cite.7.'Hill_and_Ming_2012}; {cite.7.'Partanen_et_al_2012}), thereby making the aerosol seeding more effective than previous estimates that neglected that effect.

In summary, evidence that cloud brightening methods are effective and feasible in changing cloud reflectivity is ambiguous and subject to many of the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} associated with aerosol–cloud interactions more broadly. If cloud brightening were to produce large local changes in ERF, those changes would affect the local {Glossary.*Energy_budget_of_the_Earth energy budget}, with further impacts on larger-scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Possible side effects accompanying such large and spatially heterogeneous changes in ERF have not been systematically studied.
