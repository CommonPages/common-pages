title: 7.7.2.4 - Cirrus Thinning

Although not strictly a form of {Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management SRM}, proposals have been made to cool the planet by reducing the coverage or longwave opacity of high thin cirrus clouds, which act to warm the surface through their {Glossary.*Greenhouse_effect greenhouse effect} (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_1.7_2_1_2 Section 7.2.1.2}). A proposal for doing so involves adding efficient IN in regions prone to forming thin cirrus cloud ({cite.7.'Mitchell_and_Finnegan_2009}). To the extent such a proposal is feasible, one modelling study suggests that an {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} of as strong as –2 W m–2 could be achieved ({cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2013}), with further negative {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} caused by a reduction in humidity of the upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} associated with the cloud changes. However, lack of understanding of cirrus cloud formation processes, as well as ice microphysical processes ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 Section 7.4.4}), makes it difficult to judge the feasibility of such a method, particularly in light of the fact that increasing ice nucleation can also increase cirrus opacity, under some circumstances producing an opposite, positive forcing ({cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2013}). Side effects specific to the ‘cirrus thinning’ method have not been investigated.
