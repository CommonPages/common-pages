title: 7.7.2 - Assessment of Proposed Solar Radiation Management Methods

A number of studies have suggested reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by placing solid or refractive disks, or dust particles, in outer space ({cite.7.'Early_1989}; {cite.7.'Mautner_1991}; {cite.7.'Angel_2006}; {cite.7.'Bewick_et_al_2012}). Although we do not assess the feasibility of these methods, they provide an easily described mechanism for reducing sunlight reaching the planet, and motivate the idealized studies discussed in {Chapters.7.7_7.7_7_3 Section 7.7.3}.
