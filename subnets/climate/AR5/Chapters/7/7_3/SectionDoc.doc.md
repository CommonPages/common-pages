title: 7.3 - Aerosols

The section assesses the role of aerosols in the climate system, focusing on {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} processes and properties, as well as other factors, that influence aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions. Processes directly relevant to aerosol–cloud interactions are discussed in {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}, and estimates of aerosol RFs and ERFs are assessed in {Chapters.7.7_5 Section 7.5}. The time evolution of aerosols and their {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} are discussed in Chapters {Chapters.2} and {Chapters.8}, with {Chapters.8 Chapter 8} also covering changes in natural volcanic aerosols.
