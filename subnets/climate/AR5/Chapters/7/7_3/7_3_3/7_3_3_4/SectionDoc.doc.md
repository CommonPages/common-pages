title: 7.3.3.4 - Ice Nuclei

Aerosols that act as IN are solid substances at atmospheric temperatures and supersaturations. Mineral dust, volcanic ash and primary bioaerosols such as bacteria, fungal spores and pollen, are typically known as good IN ({cite.7.'Vali_1985}; Hoose and Möhler, 2012). Conflicting evidence has been presented for the ability of {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}, organic, organic semi-solid/glassy organic and {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning particles to act as IN (Hoose and Möhler, 2012; {cite.7.'Murray_et_al_2012}). The importance of biological particles acting as IN is unclear. A new study finds evidence of a large fraction of submicron particles in the middle-to-upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} to be composed of biological particles (DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013); however global modelling studies suggest that their concentrations are not sufficient to play an important role for ice formation ({cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2010a}; {cite.7.'Sesartic_et_al_2012}). Because BC has {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} sources, its increase since pre-industrial times may have caused changes to the {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of mixed-phase clouds ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 Section 7.4.4}) and thus to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} ({cite.7.'Lohmann_2002b}; {Chapters.7.7_5 Section 7.5}).

Four heterogeneous ice-nucleation modes are distinguished in the literature: immersion freezing (initiated from within a cloud droplet), condensation freezing (freezing during droplet formation), contact freezing (due to collision with an IN) and deposition nucleation (that refers to the direct deposition of vapour onto IN). Lidar observations reveal that liquid cloud droplets are present before ice crystals form via heterogeneous freezing mechanisms ({cite.7.'Ansmann_et_al_2008}; de Boer et al., 2011), indicating that deposition nucleation does not seem to be important for mixed-phase clouds. IN can either be bare or mixed with other substances. As bare particles age in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, they acquire liquid surface coatings by condensing soluble species and water vapour or by coagulating with soluble particles, which may transform IN from deposition or contact nuclei into possible immersion nuclei. A change from contact to immersion freezing implies activation at colder temperatures, with consequences for the lifetime and {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} of mixed-phase clouds (Sections {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 7.4.4} and {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_3 7.5.3}).

The atmospheric concentrations of IN are very uncertain because of the aforementioned {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in freezing mechanisms and the difficulty of measuring IN in the upper troposphere. The anthropogenic fraction cannot be estimated at this point because of a lack of knowledge about the anthropogenic fractions of BC and mineral dust acting as IN and the contributions of PBAPs, other organic aerosols and other aerosols acting as IN.
