title: 7.3.3.1 - Chemical Composition and Mixing State

Research on the climate impacts of aerosols has moved beyond the simple cases of externally mixed sulphate, {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} emitted from fossil fuel combustion and {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning aerosols. Although the role of inorganic aerosols as an important {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} contributor to {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}– radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions has not been questioned, BC has received increasing attention because of its high absorption as has SOA because of its ubiquitous nature and ability to mix with other aerosol types.

The physical properties of BC (strongly light-absorbing, refractory with a vaporization temperature near 4000 K, aggregate in morphology, insoluble in most organic solvents) allow a strict definition in principle ({cite.7.'Bond_et_al_2013}). Direct measurement of individual BC-containing particles is possible with laser-induced incandescence (single particle soot photometer, also called SP2; {cite.7.'Gao_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Schwarz_et_al_2008a}; {cite.7.'Moteki_and_Kondo_2010}), which has enabled accurate measurements of the size of BC cores, as well as total BC mass concentrations. Condensation of gas-phase compounds on BC and coagulation with other particles alter the mixing state of BC (e.g., {cite.7.'Li_et_al_2003}; Pósfai et al., 2003; {cite.7.'Adachi_et_al_2010}), which can produce internally mixed BC in polluted urban air on a time scale of about 12 hours ({cite.7.'Moteki_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'McMeeking_et_al_2010}). The resulting BC-containing particles can become hygroscopic, which can lead to reduced {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} and atmospheric loading ({cite.7.'Stier_et_al_2006}).

Formation processes of OA still remain highly uncertain, which is a major weakness in the present understanding and model representation of atmospheric aerosols ({cite.7.'Kanakidou_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Hallquist_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Ziemann_and_Atkinson_2012}). Measurements by aerosol mass spectrometers have provided some insights into sources and atmospheric processing of OA ({cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2005b}; {cite.7.'Lanz_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}). Observations at continental mid-latitudes including urban and rural/remote air suggest that the majority of SOA is probably oxygenated OA ({cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2005a}, 2007a). Experiments within and downstream of urban air indicate that under most circumstances SOA substantially contributes to the total OA mass (de Gouw et al., 2005; {cite.7.'Volkamer_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2007a}).

There is a large range in the complexity with which OA is represented in global aerosol models. Some complex, yet still parameterized, chemical schemes have been developed recently that account for multigenerational oxidation ({cite.7.'Robinson_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Jimenez_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Donahue_et_al_2011a}). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, some regional and global model have used a new scheme based on lumping VOCs into volatility bins ({cite.7.'Robinson_et_al_2007}), which is an improved representation of the two-product absorptive partitioning scheme ({cite.7.'Kroll_and_Seinfeld_2008}) for the formation and aging of SOA. This new framework includes organic compounds of different volatility, produced from parent VOCs by multi-generation oxidation processes and partitioned between the aerosol and gas phases ({cite.7.'Farina_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Tsimpidi_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Yu_2011}), which improves the agreement between observed and modeled SOA in urban areas ({cite.7.'Hodzic_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Shrivastava_et_al_2011}). Field observations and laboratory studies suggest that OA is also formed efficiently in aerosol and cloud and liquid water contributing a substantial fraction of the {Glossary.*Organic_aerosol organic aerosol} mass ({cite.7.'Sorooshian_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Miyazaki_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Lim_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Ervens_et_al_2011a}). Chemical reactions in the aerosol phase (e.g., oligomerization) also make OA less volatile and more hygroscopic, influencing aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions ({cite.7.'Jimenez_et_al_2009}). As a consequence, OA concentrations are probably underestimated in many global aerosol models that do not include these chemical processes ({cite.7.'Hallquist_et_al_2009}).

Some of the OA is light absorbing and can be referred to as brown carbon (BrC; {cite.7.'Kirchstetter_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Andreae_and_Gelencser_2006}). A fraction of the SOA formed in cloud and aerosol water is lightabsorbing in the visible (e.g., {cite.7.'Shapiro_et_al_2009}), while SOA produced from gas-phase oxidation of VOCs absorbs ultraviolet radiation (e.g., {cite.7.'Nakayama_et_al_2010}).

Multiple observations show co-existence of external and internal mixtures relatively soon after {Topics.*Emissions emission} (e.g., {cite.7.'Hara_et_al_2003}; {cite.7.'Schwarz_et_al_2008b}; {cite.7.'Twohy_and_Anderson_2008}). In biomass burning aerosol, organic compounds and BC are frequently internally mixed with ammonium, nitrate, and sulphate ({cite.7.'Deboudt_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Pratt_and_Prather_2010}). Over urban locations, as much as 90% of the particles are internally mixed with secondary inorganic species ({cite.7.'Bi_et_al_2011}). Likewise mineral dust and biomass burning aerosols can become internally mixed when these aerosol types age together ({cite.7.'Hand_et_al_2010}). The aerosol mixing state can alter particle size distribution and hygroscopicity and hence the aerosol optical properties and ability to act as {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} ({cite.7.'Wex_et_al_2010}). Global aerosol models can now approximate the aerosol mixing state using size-resolving bin or modal schemes (e.g., {cite.7.'Stier_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Kim_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Mann_et_al_2010}).
