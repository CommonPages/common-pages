title: 7.3.3.3 - Cloud Condensation Nuclei

A subset of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} particles acts as {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} (see {'Table_7_2 Table 7.2}). The ability of an aerosol particle to take up water and subsequently activate, thereby acting as a CCN at a given supersaturation, is determined by its size and composition. Common CCN in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} are composed of sea salt, sulphates and sulphuric acid, nitrate and nitric acid and some organics. The {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} of water vapour by hygroscopic aerosols strongly affects their {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions RFari}.

CCN activity of inorganic aerosols is relatively well understood, and lately most attention has been paid to the CCN activity of mixed organic/inorganic aerosols (e.g., {cite.7.'King_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Prisle_et_al_2010}). Uncertainties in our current understanding of CCN properties are due primarily to SOA ({cite.7.'Good_et_al_2010}), mainly because OA is still poorly characterized ({cite.7.'Jimenez_et_al_2009}). The important effect of the formation of SOA is that internally mixed SOA contributes to the mass of aerosol particles, and therefore to their sizes. The size of the CCN has been found to be more important than their chemical composition at two continental locations as larger particles are more readily activated than smaller particles because they require a lower critical supersaturation ({cite.7.'Dusek_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Ervens_et_al_2007}). However, the chemical composition may be important in other locations such as the marine environment, where primary organic particles (hydrogels) have been shown to be exceptionally good CCN ({cite.7.'Orellana_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Ovadnevaite_et_al_2011}). For SOA it is not clear how important surface tension effects and bulk-to-surface partitioning of surfactants are, and if the water activity coefficient changes significantly as a function of the solute concentration ({cite.7.'Prisle_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Good_et_al_2010}).

The bulk hygroscopicity parameter k has been introduced as a concise measure of how effectively an aerosol particle acts as a CCN ({cite.7.'Rissler_et_al_2004}, 2010; {cite.7.'Petters_and_Kreidenweis_2007}). It can be measured experimentally and is increasingly being used as a way to characterize aerosol properties. {cite.7.'Pringle_et_al_2010 Pringle et al. (2010)} used surface and aircraft measurements to evaluate the k distributions simulated by a global aerosol model, and found generally good agreement. When the aerosol is dominated by organics, discrepancies between values of k obtained directly from both CCN activity measurements and sub-saturated particle water uptake measurements have been observed in some instances (e.g., {cite.7.'Prenni_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Irwin_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Roberts_et_al_2010}), whereas in other studies closure has been obtained (e.g., {cite.7.'Duplissy_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Kammermann_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Rose_et_al_2011}). Adsorption theory ({cite.7.'Kumar_et_al_2011}) replaces k-theory for CCN activation for insoluble particles (e.g., mineral dust) while alternative theories are still required for explanation of marine POA that seem to have peculiar gel-like properties ({cite.7.'Ovadnevaite_et_al_2011}).

Available modelling studies ({cite.7.'Pierce_and_Adams_2009a}; {cite.7.'Wang_and_Penner_2009}; {cite.7.'Schmidt_et_al_2012a}) disagree on the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} fraction of CCN (taken here at 0.2% supersaturation). Based on these studies we assess this fraction to be between one fourth and two thirds in the global mean with low confidence, and highlight large interhemispheric and regional variations. Models that neglect or underestimate volcanic and natural organic aerosols would overestimate this fraction.
