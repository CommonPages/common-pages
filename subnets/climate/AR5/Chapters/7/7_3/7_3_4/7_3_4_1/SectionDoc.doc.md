title: 7.3.4.1 - Radiative Effects due to Aerosol–Radiation Interactions

The {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} due to {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–radiation interactions (REari), formerly known as direct radiative effect, is the change in radiative flux caused by the combined scattering and absorption of radiation by {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and natural aerosols. The REari results from well understood physics and is close to being an observable quantity, yet our knowledge of aerosol and environmental characteristics needed to quantify the REari at the global scale remains incomplete ({cite.7.'Anderson_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Satheesh_and_Moorthy_2005}; Jaeglé et al., 2011). The REari requires knowledge of the spectrally varying aerosol extinction coefficient, single scattering {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}, and phase function, which can in principle be estimated from the aerosol size distribution, shape, chemical composition and mixing state ({'Figure_7_12 Figure 7.12}). Radiative properties of the surface, atmospheric trace gases and clouds also influence the REari. In the solar spectrum under cloud-free conditions the REari is typically negative at the TOA, but it weakens and can become positive with increasing aerosol absorption, decreasing upscatter fraction or increasing albedo of the underlying surface. REari is weaker in cloudy conditions, except when the cloud layer is thin or when absorbing aerosols are located above or between clouds (e.g., {cite.7.'Chand_et_al_2009}). The REari at the surface is negative and can be much stronger than the REari at the TOA over regions where aerosols are absorbing ({cite.7.'Li_et_al_2010}). In the longwave part of the spectrum, TOA REari is generally positive and mainly exerted by coarse-mode aerosols, such as sea spray and desert dust ({cite.7.'Reddy_et_al_2005}), and by stratospheric aerosols ({cite.7.'McCormick_et_al_1995}).

There have been many measurement-based estimates of shortwave REari (e.g., {cite.7.'Yu_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Bergamo_et_al_2008}; Di Biagio et al., 2010; {cite.7.'Bauer_et_al_2011}) although some studies involve some degree of modelling. In contrast, estimates of longwave REari remain limited (e.g., {cite.7.'Bharmal_et_al_2009}). Observed and calculated shortwave radiative fluxes agree within measurement uncertainty when aerosol properties are known (e.g., {cite.7.'Osborne_et_al_2011}). Global observational estimates of the REari rely on satellite remote sensing of aerosol properties and/ or measurements of the Earth’s radiative budget ({cite.7.'Chen_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Kahn_2012}). Estimates of shortwave TOA REari annually averaged over cloud-free oceans range from –4 to –6 W m–2, mainly contributed by sea spray ({cite.7.'Bellouin_et_al_2005}; Loeb and Manalo-Smith, 2005; {cite.7.'Yu_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Myhre_et_al_2007}). However, REari can reach tens of W m–2 locally. Estimates over land are more difficult as the surface is less well characterized ({cite.7.'Chen_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Jethva_et_al_2009}) despite recent progress in aerosol inversion algorithms (e.g., {cite.7.'Dubovik_et_al_2011}). Attempts to estimate the REari in cloudy sky remain elusive (e.g., {cite.7.'Peters_et_al_2011b}), although passive and active remote sensing of aerosols over clouds is now possible ({cite.7.'Torres_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Omar_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Waquet_et_al_2009}; de Graaf et al., 2012). Notable areas of positive TOA REari exerted by absorbing aerosols include the Arctic over ice surfaces ({cite.7.'Stone_et_al_2008}) and seasonally over southeastern Atlantic stratocumulus clouds ({cite.7.'Chand_et_al_2009}; de Graaf et al., 2012). While AOD and aerosol size are relatively well constrained, {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the aerosol single-scattering albedo ({cite.7.'McComiskey_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Loeb_and_Su_2010}) and vertical profile (e.g., {cite.7.'Zarzycki_and_Bond_2010}) contribute significantly to the overall uncertainties in REari. Consequently, diversity in large-scale numerical model estimates of REari increases with aerosol absorption and between cloud-free and cloudy conditions ({cite.7.'Stier_et_al_2013}).
