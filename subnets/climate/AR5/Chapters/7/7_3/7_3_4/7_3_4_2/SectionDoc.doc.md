title: 7.3.4.2 - Rapid Adjustments to Aerosol–Radiation Interactions

{Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol}–radiation interactions give rise to rapid adjustments (see {Chapters.7.7_1 Section 7.1}), which are particularly pronounced for absorbing aerosols such as {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}. Associated cloud changes are often referred to as the semi-{Glossary.*Direct_aerosol_effect direct aerosol effect} (see {'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}). The {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} from aerosol–radiation interactions is quantified in {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2 Section 7.5.2}; only the corresponding processes governing rapid adjustments are discussed here. Impacts on precipitation are discussed in {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_3 Section 7.6.3}.

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, additional observational studies have found correlations between cloud cover and absorbing aerosols (e.g., {cite.7.'Brioude_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Wilcox_2010}), and eddy-resolving, regional and global scale modelling studies have helped confirm a causal link. Relationships between cloud and aerosol reveal a more complicated picture than initially anticipated (e.g., {cite.7.'Hill_and_Dobbie_2008}; Koch and Del Genio, 2010; {cite.7.'Zhuang_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Sakaeda_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Ghan_et_al_2012}).

Absorbing aerosols modify atmospheric stability in the boundary layer and free {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} (e.g., {cite.7.'Wendisch_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Babu_et_al_2011}). The effect of this on cloud cover depends on the height of the aerosol relative to the cloud and the type of cloud (e.g., {cite.7.'Yoshimori_and_Broccoli_2008}; {cite.7.'Allen_and_Sherwood_2010}; Koch and Del Genio, 2010; {cite.7.'Persad_et_al_2012}). Aerosol also reduces the downwelling {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} at the surface. Together the changes in atmospheric stability and reduction in surface fluxes provide a means for aerosols to significantly modify the fraction of surface-forced clouds ({cite.7.'Feingold_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Sakaeda_et_al_2011}). These changes may also affect precipitation as discussed in {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_3 Section 7.6.3}.

Cloud cover is expected to decrease if absorbing aerosol is embedded in the cloud layer. This has been observed ({cite.7.'Koren_et_al_2004}) and simulated (e.g., {cite.7.'Feingold_et_al_2005}) for clouds over the Amazon {Glossary.*Forest forest} in the presence of smoke aerosols. In the stratocumulus regime, absorbing aerosol above cloud top strengthens the temperature inversion, reduces entrainment and tends to enhance cloudiness. Satellite observations ({cite.7.'Wilcox_2010}) and modelling ({cite.7.'Johnson_et_al_2004}) of marine stratocumulus show a thickening of the cloud layer beneath layers of absorbing smoke aerosol, which induces a local negative {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}. The responses of other cloud types, such as those associated with deep {Glossary.*Convection convection}, are not well determined.

Absorbing aerosols embedded in cloud drops enhance their absorption, which can affect the dissipation of cloud. The contribution to {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions RFari} is small ({cite.7.'Stier_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Ghan_et_al_2012}), and there is contradictory evidence regarding the magnitude of the cloud dissipation effect influencing {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari} ({cite.7.'Feingold_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Ghan_et_al_2012}; {cite.7.'Jacobson_2012}; {cite.7.'Bond_et_al_2013}). Global forcing estimates are necessarily based on global models (see {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2 Section 7.5.2}), although the accuracy of {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} in this regard is limited by their ability to represent low cloud processes accurately. This is an area of concern as discussed in {Chapters.7.7_2 Section 7.2} and limits confidence in these estimates.
