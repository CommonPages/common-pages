title: 7.3.2.2 - Aerosol Processes

New particle formation is the process by which low-volatility vapours nucleate into stable molecular clusters, which under certain condensable vapour regimes can grow rapidly to produce nanometre-sized {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} particles. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, substantial progress in our understanding of atmospheric nucleation and new particle formation has been made (e.g., {cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2012a}). {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change Multiple lines of evidence} indicate that while sulphuric acid is the main driver of nucleation ({cite.7.'Kerminen_et_al_2010}; Sipilä et al., 2010), the nucleation rate is affected by ammonia and amines ({cite.7.'Kurten_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Smith_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Kirkby_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Yu_et_al_2012}) as well as low-volatility organic vapours ({cite.7.'Metzger_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Paasonen_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2010a}). Nucleation pathways involving only uncharged molecules are expected to dominate over nucleation induced by ionization of atmospheric molecules in continental boundary layers, but the situation might be different in the free {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.7.'Kazil_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Hirsikko_et_al_2011}).

Condensation is the main process transferring low-volatility vapours to aerosol particles, and also usually the dominant process for growth to larger sizes. The growth of the smallest particles depends crucially on the condensation of organic vapours ({cite.7.'Donahue_et_al_2011b}; {cite.7.'Riipinen_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Yu_2011}) and is therefore tied strongly with atmospheric SOA formation discussed in {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_3.7_3_3_1 Section 7.3.3.1}. The treatment of condensation of semi-volatile compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid and most organic vapours, remains a challenge in climate modeling. In addition, small aerosol particles collide with one another and stick (coagulate), one of the processes contributing to aerosol internal mixing. Coagulation is an important {Glossary.*Sink sink} for sub-micrometre size particles, typically under high concentrations near sources and at lower concentrations in locations where the aerosol {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} is long and amount of condensable vapours is low. It is the main sink for the smallest aerosol particles ({cite.7.'Pierce_and_Adams_2007}).

Since AR4, observations of atmospheric nucleation and subsequent growth of nucleated particles to larger sizes have been increasingly reported in different atmospheric environments ({cite.7.'Kulmala_and_Kerminen_2008}; {cite.7.'Manninen_et_al_2010}; O’Dowd et al., 2010). Nucleation and growth enhance atmospheric {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} concentrations ({cite.7.'Spracklen_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Merikanto_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Pierce_and_Adams_2009a}; {cite.7.'Yu_and_Luo_2009}) and potentially affect aerosol–cloud interactions ({cite.7.'Wang_and_Penner_2009}; {cite.7.'Kazil_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Makkonen_et_al_2012a}). However, CCN concentrations may be fairly insensitive to changes in nucleation rate because the growth of nucleated particles to larger sizes is limited by coagulation (see Sections {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_3.7_3_3_3 7.3.3.3} and {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_6.7_4_6_2 7.4.6.2}).

Aerosols also evolve due to cloud processing, followed by the aerosol release upon evaporation of cloud particles, affecting the number concentration, composition, size and mixing state of atmospheric aerosol particles. This occurs via aqueous-phase chemistry taking place inside clouds, via altering aerosol precursor chemistry around and below clouds, and via different aerosol–hydrometeor interactions. These processes are discussed further in {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_1.7_4_1_2 Section 7.4.1.2}.

The understanding and modelling of aerosol sinks has seen less progress since AR4 in comparison to other aerosol processes. Improved dry deposition models, which depend on the particle size as well as the characteristics of the Earth’s surface, have been developed and are increasingly being used in global aerosol models ({cite.7.'Kerkweg_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Feng_2008}; {cite.7.'Petroff_and_Zhang_2010}). Sedimentation throughout the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and its role in dry deposition at the surface are important for the largest particles in the coarse mode. The uncertainty in the estimate of wet deposition by nucleation and impaction scavenging is controlled by the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} of the amount, frequency and areal extent of precipitation, as well as the size and chemical composition of aerosol particles. For insoluble primary particles like {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} and dust, nucleation scavenging also depends strongly on their degree of mixing with soluble compounds. {Glossary.*Parameterization Parameterization} of aerosol wet deposition remains a key {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in aerosol models, which affects the vertical and horizontal distributions of aerosols ({cite.7.'Prospero_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Vignati_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Lee_et_al_2011}), with further impact on model estimates of aerosol {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}.
