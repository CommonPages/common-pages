title: 7.3.2.1 - Aerosol Sources

Sea spray is produced at the sea surface by bubble bursting induced mostly, but not exclusively, by breaking waves. The effective emission flux of sea spray particles to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} depends on the surface wind speed, sea state and atmospheric stability, and to a lesser extent on the temperature and composition of the sea water. Our understanding of sea spray {Topics.*Emissions emissions} has increased substantially since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}; however, process-based estimates of the total mass and size distribution of emitted sea spray particles continue to have large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} (de Leeuw et al., 2011; {'Table_7_1 Table 7.1}). Sea spray particles are composed of sea salt and marine primary organic matter, the latter being found preferentially in particles smaller than 200 nm in diameter ({cite.7.'Leck_and_Bigg_2008}; {cite.7.'Russell_et_al_2010}). The emission rate of marine POA depends on biological activity in ocean waters ({cite.7.'Facchini_et_al_2008}) and its global emission rate has been estimated to be in the range 2 to 20 Tg yr–1 ({cite.7.'Gantt_et_al_2011}). Uncertainty in the {Glossary.*Source source} and composition of sea spray translates into a significant uncertainty in the {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} number concentration in the marine {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} that, unlike aerosol optical depth and mass concentrations, can only be constrained by in situ observations ({cite.7.'Heintzenberg_et_al_2000}; Jaeglé et al., 2011).

Mineral dust particles are produced mainly by disintegration of aggregates following creeping and saltation of larger soil particles over desert and other arid surfaces (e.g., {cite.7.'Zhao_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Kok_2011}). The magnitude of dust emissions to the atmosphere depends on the surface wind speed and many soil-related factors such as its texture, moisture and vegetation cover. The range of estimates for the global dust emissions spans a factor of about five ({cite.7.'Huneeus_et_al_2011}; {'Table_7_1 Table 7.1}). {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} sources, including road dust and mineral dust due to human {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}, remain ill quantified although some recent satellite observations suggest the fraction of mineral dust due to the latter source could be 20 to 25% of the total ({cite.7.'Ginoux_et_al_2012a}, 2012b).

The sources of {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning aerosols at the global scale are usually inferred from satellite retrieval of burned areas and/or active fires, but inventories continue to suffer from the lack of sensitivity of satellite data to small fires ({cite.7.'Randerson_et_al_2012}) and uncertainties in emission factors. Terrestrial sources of PBAPs include bacteria, pollen, fungal spores, lichen, viruses and fragments of animals and plants (Després et al., 2012). Most of these particles are emitted in the coarse mode (Pöschl et al., 2010) and the contribution to the {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} mode is thought to be small. There are only a few estimates of the global flux of PBAPs and these are poorly constrained ({cite.7.'Burrows_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Heald_and_Spracklen_2009}; see {'Table_7_1 Table 7.1}).

The main natural aerosol {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} are dimethylsulphide (DMS) emitted by the oceans and biogenic {Glossary.*Volatile_Organic_Compounds volatile organic compounds} (BVOC) emitted mainly by the terrestrial {Glossary.*Biosphere_terrestrial_and_marine biosphere}. BVOC emissions depend on the amount and type of vegetation, temperature, radiation, the ambient {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration and soil humidity ({cite.7.'Grote_and_Niinemets_2008}; {cite.7.'Pacifico_et_al_2009}; Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010). While speciated BVOC emission inventories have been derived for some continental regions, global emission inventories or schemes are available only for isoprene, monoterpenes and a few other compounds (Müller et al., 2008; {cite.7.'Guenther_et_al_2012}). The total global BVOC emissions have large uncertainties, despite the apparent convergence in different model-based estimates ({cite.7.'Arneth_et_al_2008}).

The ratio of secondary to primary {Glossary.*Organic_aerosol organic aerosol} is larger than previously thought, but has remained somewhat ambiguous due to atmospheric transformation processes affecting both these components ({cite.7.'Robinson_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Jimenez_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Pye_and_Seinfeld_2010}). Globally, most of the atmospheric SOA is expected to originate from biogenic sources, even though anthropogenic sources could be equally important at northern mid-latitudes (de Gouw and Jimenez, 2009; {cite.7.'Lin_et_al_2012}). Recent studies suggest that the SOA formation from BVOCs may be enhanced substantially by anthropogenic pollution due to (1) high concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) enhancing BVOC oxidation, and (2) high anthropogenic POA concentrations that facilitate transformation of oxidized volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the particle phase ({cite.7.'Carlton_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Heald_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Hoyle_et_al_2011}). The uncertainty range of atmospheric SOA formation is still large and estimated to be approximately 20 to 380 Tg yr–1 ({cite.7.'Hallquist_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Farina_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Heald_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Spracklen_et_al_2011}; {'Table_7_1 Table 7.1}).

Anthropogenic sources of aerosol particles ({Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}, POA) and aerosol precursors (sulphur dioxide, ammonia, NOx and NMVOCs, hereafter also referred to as VOCs for simplicity) can be inferred from a priori emission inventories ({'Table_7_1 Table 7.1}). They are generally better constrained than natural sources, exceptions being anthropogenic sources of BC, which could be underestimated ({cite.7.'Bond_et_al_2013}), and anthropogenic emissions of some VOCs, fly-ash and dust which are still poorly known. Since AR4, remote sensing by satellites has been increasingly used to constrain natural and anthropogenic aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions (e.g., {cite.7.'Dubovik_et_al_2008}; Jaeglé et al., 2011; {cite.7.'Huneeus_et_al_2012}).
