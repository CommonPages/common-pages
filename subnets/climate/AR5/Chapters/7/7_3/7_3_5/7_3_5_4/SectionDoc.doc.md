title: 7.3.5.4 - Synthesis

The {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, properties and concentrations of aerosols or {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} could respond significantly to climate change, but there is little consistency across studies in the magnitude or sign of this response. The lack of consistency arises mostly from our limited understanding of processes governing the {Glossary.*Source source} of natural aerosols and the complex interplay of aerosols with the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle}. The {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} parameter as a result of the future changes in emissions of natural aerosols is mostly bracketed within ±0.1 W m–2 °C–1 ({cite.7.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}). With respect to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} aerosols, {cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2009 Liao et al. (2009)} showed a significant positive feedback (feedback parameter of +0.04 to +0.15 W m–2 °C–1 on a global mean basis) while {cite.7.'Bellouin_et_al_2011 Bellouin et al. (2011)} simulated a smaller negative feedback of −0.08 to −0.02 W m–2 °C–1. Overall we assess that models simulate relatively small feedback parameters (i.e., within ±0.2 W m–2 °C–1) with low confidence, however regional effects on the aerosol may be important.
