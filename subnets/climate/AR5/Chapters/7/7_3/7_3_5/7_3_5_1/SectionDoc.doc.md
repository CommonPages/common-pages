title: 7.3.5.1 - Changes in Sea Spray and Mineral Dust

Concentrations of sea spray will respond to changes in surface wind speed, atmospheric stability, precipitation and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} cover ({cite.7.'Struthers_et_al_2011}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} disagree about the balance of effects, with estimates ranging from an overall 19% reduction in global sea salt burden from the present-day to year 2100 ({cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2006}), to little sensitivity ({cite.7.'Mahowald_et_al_2006a}), to a sizeable increase ({cite.7.'Jones_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Bellouin_et_al_2011}). In particular there is little understanding of how surface wind speed may change over the ocean in a warmer climate, and observed recent changes (e.g., {cite.7.'Young_et_al_2011}; {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_2 Section 2.7.2}) may not be indicative of future changes. Given that sea spray particles comprise a significant fraction of {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN} concentrations over the oceans, such large changes will feed back on climate through changes in cloud droplet number ({cite.7.'Korhonen_et_al_2010b}).

Studies of the effects of climate change on dust loadings also give a wide range of results. {cite.7.'Woodward_et_al_2005 Woodward et al. (2005)} found a tripling of the dust burden in 2100 relative to present-day because of a large increase in bare soil fraction. A few studies {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} moderate (10 to 20%) increases, or decreases (e.g., {cite.7.'Tegen_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Jacobson_and_Streets_2009}; {cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2009}). {cite.7.'Mahowald_et_al_2006b Mahowald et al. (2006b)} found a 60% decrease under a doubled {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration due to the effect of CO2 fertilization on vegetation. The large range reflects different responses of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and vegetation cover to climate change {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, and results in low confidence in these {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions}.
