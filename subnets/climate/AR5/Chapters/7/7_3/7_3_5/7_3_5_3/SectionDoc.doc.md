title: 7.3.5.3 - Changes in Carbonaceous Aerosols

There is evidence that future climate change could lead to increases in the occurrence of wildfires because of changes in fuel availability, readiness of the fuel to burn and ignition sources ({cite.7.'Mouillot_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Marlon_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Spracklen_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Kloster_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Pechony_and_Shindell_2010}). However, vegetation dynamics may also play a role that is not well understood. Increased fire occurrence would increase {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} emissions, but decrease BVOC emissions. This could lead to a small positive or negative net {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} and {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} ({cite.7.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}).

A large fraction of SOA forms from the oxidation of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes from biogenic sources ({Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_3.7_3_3_1 Section 7.3.3.1}). {Topics.*Emissions Emissions} from vegetation can increase in a warmer {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, everything else being constant ({cite.7.'Guenther_et_al_2006}). Global aerosol models simulate an increase in isoprene emissions of 22 to 55% by 2100 in response to temperature change ({cite.7.'Sanderson_et_al_2003}; {cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Heald_et_al_2008}) and a change in global SOA burden of −6% to +100% through climate-induced changes in aerosol processes and removal rates ({cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Tsigaridis_and_Kanakidou_2007}; {cite.7.'Heald_et_al_2008}). An observationally based study suggest a small global feedback parameter of −0.01 W m–2 °C–1 despite larger regional effects ({cite.7.'Paasonen_et_al_2013}). Increasing {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations, {Glossary.*Drought drought} and surface {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} also affect BVOC emissions ({cite.7.'Arneth_et_al_2007}; Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010), which adds significant {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} to future global emissions ({cite.7.'Makkonen_et_al_2012b}). Future changes in vegetation cover, whether they are natural or {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic}, also introduce large uncertainty in emissions (Lathière et al., 2010; {cite.7.'Wu_et_al_2012}). There is little understanding on how the marine {Glossary.*Source source} of {Glossary.*Organic_aerosol organic aerosol} may change with climate, notwithstanding the large range of emission estimates for the present day ({cite.7.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}).
