title: 7.3.5.2 - Changes in Sulphate, Ammonium and Nitrate Aerosols

The DMS–sulphate–cloud–climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} loop could operate in numerous ways through changes in temperature, absorbed {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}, ocean mixed layer depth and nutrient recycling, {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} extent, wind speed, shift in marine ecosystems due to {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} and climate change, and atmospheric processing of DMS into {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei CCN}. Although no study has included all the relevant effects, two decades of research have questioned the original formulation of the feedback loop ({cite.7.'Leck_and_Bigg_2007}) and have provided important insights into this complex, coupled system ({cite.7.'Ayers_and_Cainey_2007}; {cite.7.'Kloster_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}). There is now medium confidence for a weak feedback due to a weak sensitivity of the CCN population to changes in DMS {Topics.*Emissions emissions}, based on converging evidence from observations and {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} model simulations ({cite.7.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Woodhouse_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Quinn_and_Bates_2011}). Parameterizations of oceanic DMS production nevertheless lack robust mechanistic justification ({cite.7.'Halloran_et_al_2010}) and as a result the sensitivity to ocean acidification and climate change remains uncertain ({cite.7.'Bopp_et_al_2004}; {cite.7.'Kim_et_al_2010}; Cameron-Smith et al., 2011).

Chemical production of sulphate increases with atmospheric temperature ({cite.7.'Aw_and_Kleeman_2003}; {cite.7.'Dawson_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Kleeman_2008}), but future changes in sulphate are found to be more sensitive to simulated future changes in precipitation removal. Under fixed {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions, most studies to date predict a small (0 to 9%) reduction in global sulphate burden mainly because of future increases in precipitation ({cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Racherla_and_Adams_2006}; {cite.7.'Unger_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Pye_et_al_2009}). However, {cite.7.'Rae_et_al_2007 Rae et al. (2007)} found a small increase in global sulphate burden from 2000 to 2100 because the simulated future precipitation was reduced in regions of high sulphate abundance.

Changes in temperature have a large impact on nitrate {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} formation through shifting gas–particle equilibria. There is some agreement among global aerosol models that climate change alone will contribute to a decrease in the nitrate concentrations ({cite.7.'Liao_et_al_2006}; {cite.7.'Racherla_and_Adams_2006}; {cite.7.'Pye_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Bellouin_et_al_2011}) with the exception of {cite.7.'Bauer_et_al_2007 Bauer et al. (2007)} who found little change in nitrate for year 2030. It should be noted however that these modeling studies have reported that changes in precursor emissions are expected to increase nitrate concentrations in the future ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5 Section 11.3.5}). Besides the changes in meteorological parameters, climate change can also influence ammonium formation by changing concentrations of sulphate and nitrate, but the effect of climate change alone was found to be small ({cite.7.'Pye_et_al_2009}).
