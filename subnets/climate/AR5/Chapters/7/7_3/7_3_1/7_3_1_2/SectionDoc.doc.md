title: 7.3.1.2 - Aerosol Observations and Climatology

New and improved observational aerosol data sets have emerged since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. A number of field experiments have taken place such as the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX, {cite.7.'Bergstrom_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Logan_et_al_2010}), African {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon} Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA; {cite.7.'Jeong_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Hansell_et_al_2010}), Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB; {cite.7.'Moorthy_et_al_2008} and references therein), Megacity Impact on Regional and Global Environments field experiment (MILAGRO; Paredes-Miranda et al., 2009), Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget Inter-comparisons of Longwave and Shortwave (GERBILS, {cite.7.'Christopher_et_al_2009}), Arctic Research of the Composition of the {Glossary.*Troposphere Troposphere} from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS, {cite.7.'Lyapustin_et_al_2010}), the Amazonian {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} Characterization Experiment 2008 (AMAZE-08, {cite.7.'Martin_et_al_2010b}), the Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality interactions (EUCAARI, {cite.7.'Kulmala_et_al_2011}) and Atmospheric Brown Clouds (ABC, {cite.7.'Nakajima_et_al_2007}), which have improved our understanding of regional aerosol properties.

Long-term aerosol mass concentrations are also measured more systematically at the surface by global and regional networks (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_3 Section 2.2.3}), and there are institutional efforts to improve the coordination and quality assurance of the measurements (e.g., {cite.7.'GAW_2011}). A survey of the main aerosol types can be constructed from such measurements (e.g., {cite.7.'Jimenez_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Zhang_et_al_2012b}; {'Figure_7_13 Figure 7.13}). Such analyses show a wide spatial variability in aerosol mass concentration, dominant aerosol type, and aerosol composition. Mineral dust dominates the aerosol mass over some continental regions with relatively higher concentrations especially in urban South Asia and China, accounting for about 35% of the total aerosol mass with diameter smaller than 10 mm. In the urban North America and South America, organic carbon (OC) contributes the largest mass fraction to the atmospheric aerosol (i.e., 20% or more), while in other areas of the world the OC fraction ranks second or third with a mean of about 16%. Sulphate normally accounts for about 10 to 30% by mass, except for the areas in rural Africa, urban Oceania and South America, where it is less than about 10%. The mass fractions of nitrate and ammonium are only around 6% and 4% on average, respectively. In most areas, elemental carbon (EC, which refers to a particular way of measuring {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}) represents less than 5% of the aerosol mass, although this percentage may be larger (about 12%) in South America, urban Africa, urban Europe, South, Southeast and East Asia and urban Oceania due to the larger impact of combustion sources. Sea salt can be dominant at oceanic remote sites with 50 to 70% of aerosol mass.

Aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is related to the column-integrated aerosol amount, is measured by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET, {cite.7.'Holben_et_al_1998}), other ground-based networks (e.g., {cite.7.'Bokoye_et_al_2001}; {cite.7.'Che_et_al_2009}) and a number of satellite-based sensors. Instruments designed for aerosol retrievals such as Moderate {Glossary.*Resolution Resolution} Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS; {cite.7.'Remer_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Levy_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Kleidman_et_al_2012}), Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR; {cite.7.'Kahn_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Kahn_et_al_2007}) and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances (POLDER)/Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with Observations from Lidar (PARASOL) (Tanré et al., 2011) are used preferentially to less specialized instruments such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; e.g., {cite.7.'Zhao_et_al_2008a}; {cite.7.'Mishchenko_et_al_2012}), Total {Glossary.*Ozone Ozone} Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS; {cite.7.'Torres_et_al_2002}) and Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR)/Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) ({cite.7.'Thomas_et_al_2010}) although the latter are useful for building aerosol climatologies because of their long measurement records (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_3 Section 2.2.3}). Although each AOD retrieval by satellite sensors shows some skill against more accurate sunphotometer measurements such as those of AERONET, there are still large differences among satellite products in regional and seasonal patterns because of differences and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in calibration, sampling, cloud screening, treatment of the surface reflectivity and aerosol microphysical properties (e.g., {cite.7.'Li_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Kokhanovsky_et_al_2010}). The global but incomplete sampling of satellite measurements can be combined with information from global aerosol models through data assimilation techniques (e.g., {cite.7.'Benedetti_et_al_2009}; {'Figure_7_14 Figure 7.14}a). Owing to the heterogeneity in their sources, their short {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} and the dependence of sinks on the meteorology, aerosol distributions show large variations on daily, seasonal and interannual scales.

The CALIPSO spaceborne lidar ({cite.7.'Winker_et_al_2009}) complements existing ground-based lidars. It now provides a climatology of the aerosol extinction coefficient ({'Figure_7_14 Figure 7.14}b–e), highlighting that over most regions the majority of the optically active aerosol resides in the lowest 1 to 2 km. {cite.7.'Yu_et_al_2010 Yu et al. (2010)} and {cite.7.'Koffi_et_al_2012 Koffi et al. (2012)} found that global aerosol models tend to have a positive bias in the aerosol extinction scale height in some (but not all) regions, due to an overestimate of aerosol concentrations above 6 km. There is less information available on the vertical profile of aerosol number and mass concentrations, although a number of field experiments involving research and commercial aircraft have measured aerosol concentrations (e.g., {cite.7.'Heintzenberg_et_al_2011}). In particular vertical profiles of BC mixing ratios have been measured during the Aerosol Radiative Forcing over India (ARFI) aircraft/high altitude balloon campaigns ({cite.7.'Satheesh_et_al_2008}), Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS; {cite.7.'Jacob_et_al_2010}), Aerosol, Radiation, and Cloud Processes affecting Arctic Climate (ARCPAC; {cite.7.'Warneke_et_al_2010}), Aerosol Radiative Forcing in East Asia (A-FORCE; {cite.7.'Oshima_et_al_2012}) and HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO1; {cite.7.'Schwarz_et_al_2010}) campaigns. Comparison between models and observations have shown that aerosol models tend to underestimate BC mass concentrations in some outflow regions, especially in Asia, but overestimate concentrations in remote regions, especially at altitudes ({cite.7.'Koch_et_al_2009b}; {'Figure_7_15 Figure 7.15}), which make estimates of their {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions RFari} uncertain (see {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2 Section 7.5.2}) given the large dependence of RFari on the vertical distribution of BC (Ban-Weiss et al., 2012). Absorption AOD can be retrieved from sun photometer measurements ({cite.7.'Dubovik_et_al_2002}) or a combination of ground-based transmittance and satellite reflectance measurements ({cite.7.'Lee_et_al_2007}) in situations where AOD is larger than about 0.4. {cite.7.'Koch_et_al_2009b Koch et al. (2009b)} and {cite.7.'Bond_et_al_2013 Bond et al. (2013)} used AERONET-based retrievals of absorption AOD to show that most AeroCom models underestimate absorption in many regions, but there remain representativeness issues when comparing point observations to a model climatology.
