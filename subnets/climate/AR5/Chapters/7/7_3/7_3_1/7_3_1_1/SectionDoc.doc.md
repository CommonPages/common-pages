title: 7.3.1.1 - Aerosol Formation and Aerosol Types

Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic}, originate from two different pathways: {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of primary particulate matter and formation of secondary particulate matter from gaseous {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} ({'Figure_7_12 Figure 7.12}). The main constituents of the atmospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} are inorganic species (such as sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, sea salt), organic species (also termed {Glossary.*Organic_aerosol organic aerosol} or OA), black carbon ({Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}, a distinct type of carbonaceous material formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil and {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} based fuels under certain conditions), mineral species (mostly desert dust) and primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs). Mineral dust, sea salt, BC and PBAPs are introduced into the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} as primary particles, whereas non-seasalt sulphate, nitrate and ammonium are predominantly from secondary aerosol formation processes. The OA has both significant primary and secondary sources. In the present-day {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, the majority of BC, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium come from anthropogenic sources, whereas sea salt, most mineral dust and PBAPs are predominantly of natural origin. Primary and secondary organic aerosols (POA and SOA) are influenced by both natural and anthropogenic sources. Emission rates of aerosols and aerosol precursors are summarized in {'Table_7_1 Table 7.1}. The characteristics and role of the main aerosol species are listed in {'Table_7_2 Table 7.2}.
