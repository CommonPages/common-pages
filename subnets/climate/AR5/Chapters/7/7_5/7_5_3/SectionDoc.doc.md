title: 7.5.3 - Estimate of Effective Radiative Forcing from Combined Aerosol–Radiation and Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

In addition to {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari}, there are changes due to {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci}). Because of nonlinearities in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} and rapid adjustments, the total effective forcing ERFari+aci does not necessarily equal the sum of the ERFari and ERFaci calculated separately. Moreover a strict separation is often difficult in either state of the art models or observations. Therefore we first assess ERFari+aci and postpone our assessment of ERFaci to {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_4 Section 7.5.4}. For similar reasons, we focus primarily on {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} rather than RF.

ERFari+aci is defined as the change in the net radiation at the TOA from pre-industrial to present day. {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate model} estimates of ERFari+aci in the literature differ for a number of reasons. (1) The reference years for pre-industrial and present-day conditions vary between estimates. Studies can use 1750, 1850, or 1890 for pre-industrial; early estimates of ERFari+aci used present-day {Topics.*Emissions emissions} for 1985, whereas most newer estimates use emissions for the year 2000. (2) The processes they include also differ: aerosol–cloud interactions in large-scale liquid stratiform clouds are typically included, but studies can also include aerosol–cloud interactions for mixed-phase, convective clouds and/or cirrus clouds. (3) The way in which ERFari+aci is calculated can also differ between models, with some earlier studies only reporting the change in {Glossary.*Shortwave_radiation shortwave radiation}. Changes in {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation} arise from rapid adjustments, or from aerosol–cloud interactions involving mixed-phase or ice clouds (e.g., {cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2008b}, 2010; {cite.7.'Ghan_et_al_2012}), and tend to partially offset changes in shortwave radiation. In the estimates discussed below and those shown in {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19}, we refer to estimates of the change in net (shortwave plus longwave) TOA radiation whenever possible, but report changes in shortwave radiation when changes in net radiation are not available. While this mostly affects earlier studies, the subset of models that we concentrate on all include both shortwave and longwave radiative effects. However, for the sake of comparison, the satellite studies must be adjusted to account for missing longwave contributions as explained below.

Early GCM estimates of ERFari+aci only included aerosol–cloud interactions in liquid phase stratiform clouds; some of these were already considered in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. Grouping these early estimates with similar (liquid phase only) estimates from publications since the AR4 yields a median value of ERFari+aci of –1.5 W m–2 with a 5 to 95% range between –2.4 and –0.6 W m–2 ({'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19}). In those studies that attempt a more complete representation of aerosol–cloud interactions, by including aerosol–cloud interactions in mixed-phase and/or convective cloud, the magnitude of the ERF tends to be somewhat smaller (see {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19}). The physical explanation for the mixed-phase reduction in the magnitude of the ERF is that some aerosols also act as IN causing supercooled clouds to glaciate and precipitate more readily. This reduction in cloud cover leads to less reflected shortwave radiation and a less negative ERFari+aci. This effect can however be offset if the IN become coated with soluble material, making them less effective at nucleating ice, leading to less efficient precipitation production and more reflected shortwave radiation ({cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2008}; {cite.7.'Storelvmo_et_al_2008a}). Models that have begun to incorporate aerosol–cloud interactions in convective clouds also have a tendency to reduce the magnitude of the ERF, but this effect is less systematic ({cite.7.'Jacobson_2003}; {cite.7.'Lohmann_2008}; {cite.7.'Suzuki_et_al_2008}) and reasons for differences among the models in this category are less well understood.

For our expert judgment of ERFari+aci a subset of GCM studies, which strived for a more complete and consistent treatment of aerosol–cloud interactions (by incorporating either convective or mixed-phase processes) was identified and scrutinized. The ERFari+aci derived from these models is somewhat less negative than in the full suite of models, and ranges from –1.68 and –0.81 W m–2 with a median value of –1.38 W m–2. Because in some cases a number of studies have been performed with the same GCM, in what might be described as an evolving effort, our assessment is further restricted to the best (usually most recent) estimate by each modelling group (see black symbols in {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19} and {'Table_7_4 Table 7.4}). This ensures that no single GCM is given a disproportionate weight. Further, we consider only simulations not constrained by the historical temperature rise, motivated by the desire to emphasize a process-based estimate. Although it may be argued that greater {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} is introduced by giving special weight to models that only incorporate more comprehensive treatments of aerosol–cloud interactions, and for processes that (as {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4} emphasizes) are on the frontier of understanding, it should be remembered that aerosol–cloud interactions for liquid-phase clouds remain very uncertain. Although the understanding and treatment of aerosol–cloud interactions in convective or mixedphase clouds are also very uncertain, as discussed in {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_4 Section 7.4.4}, we exercise our best judgment of their influence.

A less negative ERFari+aci (–0.93 to –0.45 W m–2 with a median of –0.85 W m–2, {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19} and {'Table_7_4 Table 7.4}) is found in studies that use variability in the present day satellite record to infer aerosol–cloud interactions, or that constrain GCM parameterizations to optimize agreement with satellite observations. Because some groups have published multiple estimates as better information became available, only their latest study was incorporated into this assessment. Moreover, if a study did not report ERFari+aci but only evaluated changes in ERFaci, their individual estimate was combined with the average ERFari of –0.45 W m–2 from {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2 Section 7.5.2}. Likewise, those (all but one) studies that only accounted for changes in shortwave radiation when computing ERFaci were corrected by adding a constant factor of +0.2 W m–2, taken from the lower range of the modeled longwave effects which varied from +0.2 to +0.6 W m–2 in the assessed models. These procedures result in the final estimates of ERFari+aci shown as black symbols in {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19} and in {'Table_7_4 Table 7.4}. This resulted in a median ERFari+aci of –0.85 W m–2 for satellite-based ERFari+aci estimates. Results of pure satellite-based studies are sensitive to the spatial scale of measurements ({cite.7.'Grandey_and_Stier_2010}; {cite.7.'McComiskey_and_Feingold_2012}; {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_2.7_4_2_2 Section 7.4.2.2}), as well as to how pre-industrial conditions and variations between preindustrial and present-day conditions are inferred from the observed variability in present-day aerosol and cloud properties ({cite.7.'Quaas_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Penner_et_al_2012}). In addition, all (modeland satellite-based) estimates of ERFari+aci are very sensitive to the assumed pre-industrial or natural cloud droplet concentration ({cite.7.'Hoose_et_al_2009}). The large spatial scales of satellite measurements relative to in situ measurements generally suggest smaller responses in cloud droplet number increases for a given aerosol increase ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_2.7_4_2_2 Section 7.4.2.2}). Satellite studies, however, show a strong effect of aerosol on cloud amount, which could be a methodological artefact as {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} associate clouds with humidity and aerosol swelling ({cite.7.'Quaas_et_al_2010}). There are thus possible biases in both directions, so the sign and magnitude of any net bias is not clear.

In large-scale models for which cloud-scale circulations are not explicitly represented, it is difficult to capture all relevant cloud controlling processes ({Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_2 Section 7.2.2}). Because the response of clouds to aerosol perturbations depends critically on the interplay of poorly understood physical processes, global model-based estimates of aerosol–cloud interactions remain uncertain ({Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}). Moreover, the connection between the aerosol amount and cloud properties is too direct in the large-scale modelling studies (as it relies heavily on the autoconversion rate). Because of this, {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} tend to overestimate the magnitude of the aerosol effect on cloud properties ({Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_5 Section 7.4.5}; see also discussion in {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_4 Section 7.5.4}). This view has some support from studies that begin to incorporate some cloud, or cloud-system scale responses to aerosol– cloud interactions. For instance, in an attempt to circumvent some of difficulties of parameterizing clouds, some groups (e.g., {cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011b}) have begun developing modelling frameworks that can explicitly represent cloud-scale circulations, and hence the spatio-temporal covariances of cloud-controlling processes. Another group ({cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_and_Yang_2013}) has used the same cloud-resolving model in a radiative convective equilibrium approach, and compared the relative contribution of aerosol–cloud interactions to warming from the doubling of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}. In both studies a smaller (–1.1 and –0.8 W m–2, respectively) ERFari+aci than for the average GCM was found. Furthermore, the study best resolving the cloud-scale circulations ({cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011b}) found little change in cloud amount in response to changes in aerosol, consistent with other fine-scale modelling studies discussed in {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}.

Based on the above considerations, we assess ERFari+aci using expert judgement to be –0.9 W m–2 with a 5 to 95% uncertainty range of –1.9 to –0.1 W m–2 (medium confidence), and a likely range of –1.5 to –0.4 W m–2. These ranges account for the GCM results by allowing for an ERFari+aci somewhat stronger than what is estimated by the satellite studies with a longer tail in the direction of stronger effects, but (for reasons given above) give less weight to the early GCM estimates shown in {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19}. The ERFari+aci can be much larger regionally but the global value is consistent with several new lines of evidence suggesting less negative estimates of aerosol–cloud interactions than the corresponding estimate in Chapter 7 of AR4 of –1.2 W m–2. The AR4 estimate was based mainly on GCM studies that did not take secondary processes (such as aerosol effects on mixed-phase and/or convective clouds) into account, did not benefit as much from the use of the recent satellite record, and did not account for the effect of rapid adjustments on the longwave radiative budget. This uncertainty range is slightly smaller than the –2.3 to –0.2 W m–2 in AR4, with a less negative upper bound due to the reasons outlined above. The best estimate of ERFari+aci is not only consistent with the studies allowing cloud-scale responses ({cite.7.'Wang_et_al_2011b}; {cite.7.'Khairoutdinov_and_Yang_2013}) but also is in line with the average ERFari+aci from the CMIP5/ ACCMIP models (about –1 W m–2, see {'Table_7_5 Table 7.5}), which as a whole reproduce the observed warming of the 20th century (see {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}). Studies that infer ERFari+aci from the historical temperature rise are discussed in {Chapters.10.10_8 Section 10.8}.
