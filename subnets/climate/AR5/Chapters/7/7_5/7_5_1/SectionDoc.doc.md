title: 7.5.1 - Introduction and Summary of AR4

In this section, {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} forcing estimates are synthesized and updated from {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}. As depicted in {'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}, RF refers to the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} due to either aerosol–radiation interactions (ari), formerly known as the direct aerosol forcing, or aerosol–cloud interactions (aci), formerly known as the first indirect aerosol forcing or cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect in AR4. {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} refers to the effective radiative forcing and is typically estimated from experiments with fixed SSTs (see Sections {Chapters.7.7_1.7_1_3 7.1.3} and {Chapters.8.8_1 8.1}). It includes rapid adjustments, such as changes to the cloud {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime}, cloud altitude, changes in {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate} due to absorbing aerosols and aerosol microphysical effects on mixed-phase, ice and convective clouds.

Chapter 2 of AR4 ({cite.7.'Forster_et_al_2007}) assessed {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions RFari} to be –0.5 ± 0.4 W m–2 and broke this down into components associated with several species. Land albedo changes associated with {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} on snow were assessed to be +0.1 ± 0.1 W m–2. The {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions RFaci} was assessed to be –0.70 W m–2 with a –1.8 to –0.3 W m–2 {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range. These uncertainty estimates were based on a combination of model results and observations from remote sensing. The semi-direct effect and other aerosol indirect effects were assessed in Chapter 7 of AR4 ({cite.7.'Denman_et_al_2007}) to contribute additional uncertainty. The combined total aerosol forcing was given as two distinct ranges: –2.3 to –0.2 W m–2 from models and a –1.7 to –0.1 W m–2 range from inverse estimates.

As discussed in {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}, it is inherently difficult to separate RFaci from subsequent rapid cloud adjustments either in observations or model calculations (e.g., {cite.7.'George_and_Wood_2010}; {cite.7.'Lohmann_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Mauger_and_Norris_2010}; {cite.7.'Painemal_and_Zuidema_2010}). For this reason estimates of RFaci are of limited interest and are not assessed in this report. This chapter estimates RFari, {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari}, and ERFari+aci based purely on a priori approaches, and calculates {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_cloud_interactions ERFaci} as the residual between ERFari+aci and ERFari assuming the two effects are additive. Inverse studies that estimate ERFari+aci from the observed rate of planetary energy {Glossary.*Uptake uptake} and estimates of climate feedbacks and other RFs are discussed in {Chapters.10.10_8 Section 10.8}.

For consistency with AR4 and {Chapters.8 Chapter 8} of this Report, all quoted ranges represent a 5 to 95% uncertainty range unless otherwise stated, and we evaluate the forcings between 1750 and approximately 2010. The reference year of 1750 is chosen to represent pre-industrial times, so changes since then broadly represent the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} effect on climate, although for several aerosol species (such as {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning) this does not quite equate to the anthropogenic effect as {Topics.*Emissions emissions} started to be influenced by humans before the {Glossary.*Industrial_Revolution Industrial Revolution}. Many studies estimate aerosol forcings between 1850 and the present day and any conversion to a forcing between 1750 and the present day increases the uncertainty ({cite.7.'Bellouin_et_al_2008}). This section principally discusses global forcing estimates and attributes them to aerosol species. {Chapters.8 Chapter 8} discusses regional forcings and additionally attributes aerosol forcing to emission sources.
