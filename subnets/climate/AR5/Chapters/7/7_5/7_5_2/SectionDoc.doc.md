title: 7.5.2 - Estimates of Radiative Forcing and Effective Radiative Forcing from Aerosolâ€“Radiation Interactions

Building on our understanding of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} processes and their radiative effects ({Chapters.7.7_3 Section 7.3}), this subsection assesses {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions RFari} and {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari}, but also the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} from absorbing aerosol ({Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} and dust) on snow and ice.
