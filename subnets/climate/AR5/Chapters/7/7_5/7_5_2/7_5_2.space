title: 7.5.2 - Estimates of Radiative Forcing and Effective Radiative Forcing from Aerosol–Radiation Interactions
section 7_5_2

  |Observations can give useful constraints to aspects of the global {Glossary.*Radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions RFari} but cannot measure it directly. To derive a best estimate and range for RFari we combine modelling and observationally based studies. {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing_due_to_aerosol_radiation_interactions ERFari} adds the radiative effects from rapid adjustments onto RFari. The {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are added in quadrature to the estimate of RFari and rounded to give an overall assessment for ERFari. The species breakdown of RFari is less certain than the total RFari.
