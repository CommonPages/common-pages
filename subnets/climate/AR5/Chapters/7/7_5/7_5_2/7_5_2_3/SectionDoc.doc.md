title: 7.5.2.3 - Absorbing Aerosol on Snow and Sea Ice

{cite.7.'Forster_et_al_2007 Forster et al. (2007)} estimated the RF for surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} changes from {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} deposited on snow to be +0.10 ± 0.10 W m–2, with a low level of understanding, based largely on studies from {cite.7.'Hansen_and_Nazarenko_2004 Hansen and Nazarenko (2004)} and {cite.7.'Jacobson_2004 Jacobson (2004)}. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, observations of BC in snow have been conducted using several different measurement techniques (e.g., {cite.7.'McConnell_et_al_2007}; Forsström et al., 2009; {cite.7.'Ming_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Xu_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Doherty_et_al_2010}; {cite.7.'Huang_et_al_2011}; {cite.7.'Kaspari_et_al_2011}), providing data with which to constrain models. Laboratory measurements have confirmed the albedo reduction due to BC in snow ({cite.7.'Hadley_and_Kirchstetter_2012}). The albedo effects of non-BC constituents have also been investigated but not rigorously quantified. Remote sensing can inform on snow impurity content in some highly polluted regions. However, it cannot be used to infer global {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} RF because of numerous {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} challenges ({cite.7.'Warren_2013}).

Global modelling studies since AR4 have quantified present-day radiative effects from BC on snow of +0.01 to +0.08 W m–2 ({cite.7.'Flanner_et_al_2007}, 2009; {cite.7.'Hansen_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Koch_et_al_2009a}; {cite.7.'Rypdal_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Skeie_et_al_2011}; Wang et al., 2011c; {cite.7.'Lee_et_al_2013}). These studies apply different BC emission inventories and atmospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} representations, include {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} from different combinations of terrestrial snow, {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, and snow on sea ice, and some include different {Glossary.*Rapid_adjustment rapid adjustment} effects such as snow grain size evolution and melt-induced {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} of impurities at the snow surface, observed on Tibetan glaciers ({cite.7.'Xu_et_al_2012}) and in Arctic snow ({cite.7.'Doherty_et_al_2013}). The forcing operates mostly on terrestrial snow and is largest during March to May, when boreal snow and ice are exposed to strong {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} ({cite.7.'Flanner_et_al_2007}).

All climate modelling studies find that the Arctic warms in response to snow and sea ice forcing. In addition, estimates of the change in global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} per unit forcing are 1.7 to 4.5 times greater for snow and sea ice forcing than for {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} forcing ({cite.7.'Hansen_and_Nazarenko_2004}; {cite.7.'Hansen_et_al_2005}; {cite.7.'Flanner_et_al_2007}; {cite.7.'Flanner_et_al_2009}; {cite.7.'Bellouin_and_Boucher_2010}). The {cite.7.'Koch_et_al_2009a Koch et al. (2009a)} estimate is not included in this range owing to the lack of a clear signal in their study. The greater response of global mean temperature occurs primarily because all of the forcing energy is deposited directly into the {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}, whose evolution drives a positive albedo {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} on climate. Key sources of forcing {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} include BC concentrations in snow and ice, BC mixing state and optical properties, snow and ice coverage and patchiness, co-presence of other light-absorbing particles in the snow pack, snow effective grain size and its influence on albedo perturbation, the masking of snow surfaces by clouds and vegetation and the accumulation of BC at the top of snowpack caused by melting and sublimation. {cite.7.'Bond_et_al_2013 Bond et al. (2013)} derive a 1750–2010 snow and sea ice RF estimate of +0.046 (+0.015 to +0.094) W m–2 for BC by (1) considering forcing ranges from all relevant global studies, (2) accounting for biases caused by (a) modelled Arctic BC-in-snow concentrations using measurements from {cite.7.'Doherty_et_al_2010 Doherty et al. (2010)}, and (b) excluding mineral dust, which reduces BC forcing by approximately 20%, (3) combining in quadrature individual uncertainty terms from {cite.7.'Flanner_et_al_2007 Flanner et al. (2007)} plus that originating from the co-presence of dust, and (4) scaling the present-day radiative contributions from BB, biofuel and fossil fuel BC {Topics.*Emissions emissions} according to their 1750–2010 changes. Note that this RF estimate allows for some rapid adjustments in the snowpack but is not a full {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} as it does not account for adjustments in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}. For this RF, we adopt an estimate of +0.04 (+0.02 to +0.09) W m–2 and note that the {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} change is roughly three (two to four) times more responsive to this RF relative to CO2.
