title: Box 5.2 - Climate-Ice Sheet Interactions

Ice sheets have played an essential role in the Earth’s climate history (see Sections {Chapters.5.5_3 5.3}, {Chapters.5.5_6 5.6} and {Chapters.5.5_7 5.7}). They interact with the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, the ocean–{Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} system, the lithosphere and the surrounding vegetation (see {Box_5_2 Box 5.2}, {'Box_5_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}). They serve as nonlinear filters and integrators of climate effects caused by orbital and GHG forcings ({cite.5.'Ganopolski_and_Calov_2011}), while at the same time affecting the global climate system on a variety of time scales (see {Chapters.5.5_7 Section 5.7}).

Ice sheets form when annual snow {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} exceeds melting. Growing ice sheets expand on previously vegetated areas, thus leading to an increase of surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo}, further cooling and an increase in net surface mass balance. As ice sheets grow in height and area, {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} drop further as a result of the lapse-rate effect, but also snow accumulation decreases because colder air holds less moisture (inlay in {Box_5_2 Box 5.2}, {'Box_5_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}). This so-called elevation-desert effect ({cite.5.'Oerlemans_1980}) is an important negative {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} for ice sheets which limits their growth. Higher elevation ice sheets can be associated with enhanced calving at their margins, because the ice flow will be accelerated directly by increased surface slopes and indirectly by lubrication at the base of the {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet}. {Glossary.*Calving Calving}, {Glossary.*Grounding_line grounding line} processes, {Glossary.*Basal_lubrication basal lubrication} and other forms of thermo-mechanical coupling may have played important roles in accelerating glacial terminations following phases of relatively slow ice sheet growth, hence contributing to the temporal saw-tooth structure of the recent {Glossary.*Glacial_interglacial_cycles glacial–interglacial cycles} ({'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}).

Large glacial ice sheets also deflect the path of the extratropical NH westerly winds ({cite.5.'Cook_and_Held_1988}), generating anticyclonic circulation anomalies ({Box_5_2 Box 5.2}, {'Box_5_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}), which tend to warm the western side of the ice sheet and cool the remainder (e.g., {cite.5.'Roe_and_Lindzen_2001}). Furthermore, the orographic effects of ice sheets lead to reorganizations of the global {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} circulation by changing the major stationary wave patterns (e.g., Abe-Ouchi et al., 2007; {cite.5.'Yin_et_al_2008}) and trade wind systems ({cite.5.'Timmermann_et_al_2004}). This allows for a fast transmission of ice sheet signals to remote regions.

The enormous weight of ice sheets depresses the underlying bedrocks causing a drop in ice sheet height and a surface warming as a result of the lapse-rate effect. The lithospheric adjustment has been shown to play an important role in modulating the ice sheet response to orbital forcing ({cite.5.'Birchfield_et_al_1981}; van den Berg et al., 2008). The presence of terrestrial sedimentary materials (regolith) on top of the unweathered bedrock affects the friction at the base of an ice sheet, and may further alter the response of continental ice sheets to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}, with impacts on the dominant periodicities of glacial cycles ({cite.5.'Clark_and_Pollard_1998}).

An area of very active research is the interaction between ice sheets, ice shelves and the ocean (see Sections {Chapters.4.4_4 4.4}, {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_3 13.4.3} and {Chapters.13.13_4.13_4_4 13.4.4}). The mass balance of marine ice sheets is strongly determined by ocean temperatures ({cite.5.'Joughin_and_Alley_2011}). {Glossary.*Advection Advection} of warmer waters below ice shelves can cause {Glossary.*Ice_shelf ice shelf} instabilities, reduced buttressing, accelerated {Glossary.*Ice_stream ice stream} flow (De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003) and grounding line retreat in regions with retrograde bedrock slopes ({cite.5.'Schoof_2012}), such as West Antarctica. On orbital and millennial time scales such processes may have played an essential role in driving ice volume changes of the West Antarctic ice sheet ({cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}) and the Laurentide ice sheet (Alvarez-Solas et al., 2010). Massive freshwater release from retreating ice sheets, can feed back to the climate system by altering {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level}, oceanic deep {Glossary.*Convection convection}, ocean circulation, heat transport, sea ice and the global atmospheric circulation (Sections {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_3 5.6.3} and {Chapters.5.5_7 5.7}).

Whereas the initial response of ice sheets to external forcings can be quite fast, involving for instance ice shelf processes and outlet glaciers (10 to 103 years), their long-term adjustment can take much longer (104 to 105 years) (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_3 Section 12.5.5.3}). As a result, the climate–{Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere} system is not even in full equilibrium with the orbital forcing. This also implies that future {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} radiative perturbations over the next century can determine the evolution of the Greenland ({cite.5.'Charbit_et_al_2008}) and Antarctic ice sheets for centuries and millennia to come with a potential commitment to significant global sea level rise ({Chapters.5.5_8 Section 5.8}).
