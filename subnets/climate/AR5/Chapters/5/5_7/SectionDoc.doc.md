title: 5.7 - Evidence and Processes of Abrupt Climate Change

Many {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} archives document climate changes that happened at rates considerably exceeding the average rate of change for longerterm averaging periods prior and after this change (see Glossary for other definition of Abrupt Climate Change). A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to explain the emergence of such abrupt climate changes (see {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5 Section 12.5.5}). Most of them invoke the existence of nonlinearities or, more specifically, thresholds in the underlying dynamics of one or more Earth-system components. Both internal dynamics and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} can generate abrupt changes in the climate state. Documentation of abrupt climate changes in the past using multiple sources of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} evidence can provide important benchmarks to test instability mechanisms in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}. This assessment of {Glossary.*Abrupt_climate_change abrupt climate change} on time scales of 10 to 100 years focuses on Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events and iceberg/meltwater discharges during Heinrich events, especially the advances since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} in reconstructing and understanding their global impacts and in extending the record of millennial-scale variability to about 800 ka.

Twenty-five abrupt DO events (North Greenland Ice Core Project members, 2004) and several centennial-scale events ({cite.5.'Capron_et_al_2010b}) occurred during the last glacial cycle (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_2 Section 5.3.2}). DO events in Greenland were marked by an abrupt transition (within a few decades) from a cold phase, referred to as Greenland Stadial (GS) into a warm phase, known as Greenland Interstadial (GI). Subsequently but within a GI, a gradual cooling preceded a rapid jump to GS that lasted for centuries up to millennia. Thermal gas-fractionation methods ({cite.5.'Landais_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Huber_et_al_2006}) suggest that for certain DO events Greenland temperatures increased by up to 16°C ± 2.5°C (1 standard deviation) within several decades. Such transitions were also accompanied by abrupt shifts in dust and deuterium excess, indicative of reorganizations in atmospheric circulation ({cite.5.'Steffensen_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Thomas_et_al_2009}). Reconstructions from the subtropical Atlantic and Mediterranean reveal concomitant {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} changes attaining values up to 5°C (e.g., {cite.5.'Martrat_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Martrat_et_al_2007}).

In spite of the visible presence of DO events in many paleoclimate records from both hemispheres, the underlying mechanisms still remain unresolved and range from internally generated {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean– {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} events ({cite.5.'Timmermann_et_al_2003}; {cite.5.'Ditlevsen_and_Ditlevsen_2009}), to solar-forced variability ({cite.5.'Braun_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Braun_and_Kurths_2010}). However, given the lack of observational evidence for a direct linear modulation of solar irradiance on DO time scales, ({cite.5.'Muscheler_and_Beer_2006}), solar forcing is an improbable candidate to generate DO events. There is robust evidence from multiple lines of paleoceanographic information and modelling that DO variability is often associated with AMOC changes, as suggested by climate models of varying complexity ({cite.5.'Ganopolski_and_Rahmstorf_2001}; {cite.5.'Arzel_et_al_2009}) and marine proxy records ({cite.5.'Piotrowski_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Kissel_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Barker_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Roberts_et_al_2010}); but also potential influences of seaice cover ({cite.5.'Li_et_al_2010b}), {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} circulation and ice sheet topography ({cite.5.'Wunsch_2006}) have been proposed.

The widespread presence of massive layers of ice-rafted detritus in North Atlantic marine sediments provide robust evidence that some DO GS, known as Heinrich stadials, were associated with iceberg discharges originating from the Northern Hemispheric ice sheets. During these periods global {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} rose by up to several tens of meters ({cite.5.'Chappell_2002}; {cite.5.'Rohling_et_al_2008b}; {cite.5.'Siddall_et_al_2008}; González and Dupont, 2009; {cite.5.'Yokoyama_and_Esat_2011}), with remaining {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in timing and amplitude of sea level rise, stadial cooling and ocean circulation changes relative to the iceberg discharge ({cite.5.'Hall_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Arz_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Siddall_et_al_2008}; González and Dupont, 2009; {cite.5.'Sierro_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Hodell_et_al_2010}). Internal instabilities of the Laurentide ice sheet can cause massive {Glossary.*Calving calving} and meltwater events similar to those reconstructed from proxy records ({cite.5.'Calov_et_al_2002}, 2010; {cite.5.'Marshall_and_Koutnik_2006}). Alternatively, an initial weakening of the AMOC can lead to subsurface warming in parts of the North Atlantic ({cite.5.'Shaffer_et_al_2004}) and subsequent basal melting of the Labrador ice shelves, and a resulting acceleration of ice streams and iceberg discharge (Alvarez-Solas et al., 2010; {cite.5.'Marcott_et_al_2011}). At present, unresolved dynamics in ice sheet models and limited proxy information do not allow us to distinguish the two mechanisms with confidence.

Since AR4, climate model simulations ({cite.5.'Liu_et_al_2009b}; Otto-Bliesner and Brady, 2010; {cite.5.'Menviel_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Kageyama_et_al_2013}) have further confirmed the finding (high confidence) that changes in AMOC strength induce abrupt climate changes with magnitude and patterns resembling reconstructed paleoclimate-proxy data of DO and Heinrich events.

Recent studies have presented a better understanding of the global imprints of DO events and Heinrich events, for various regions. Widespread North Atlantic cooling and sea-ice anomalies during GS induced atmospheric circulation changes (high confidence) ({cite.5.'Krebs_and_Timmermann_2007}; {cite.5.'Clement_and_Peterson_2008}; {cite.5.'Kageyama_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Merkel_et_al_2010}; Otto-Bliesner and Brady, 2010; {cite.5.'Timmermann_et_al_2010}) which in turn affected inter-hemispheric tropical rainfall patterns, leading to drying in Northern South America ({cite.5.'Peterson_and_Haug_2006}), the Mediterranean (Fletcher and Sánchez Goñi, 2008; {cite.5.'Fleitmann_et_al_2009}), equatorial western Africa and Arabia ({cite.5.'Higginson_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Ivanochko_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Weldeab_et_al_2007a}; {cite.5.'Mulitza_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Tjallingii_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Itambi_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Weldeab_2012}), wide parts of Asia ({cite.5.'Wang_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Cai_et_al_2010}) (see {'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}e) as well as in the Australian-Indonesian {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.5.'Mohtadi_et_al_2011}). Concomitant wetter conditions have been reconstructed for southwestern North America ({cite.5.'Asmerom_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Wagner_et_al_2010}) and southern South America ({cite.5.'Kanner_et_al_2012}) ({'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}h). Moreover, atmospheric circulation changes have been invoked ({cite.5.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2005}; {cite.5.'Xie_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Okumura_et_al_2009}) to explain temperature variations in the North Pacific that varied in unison with abrupt climate change in the North Atlantic region ({cite.5.'Harada_et_al_2008}, 2012; {cite.5.'Pak_et_al_2012}). Other factors that may have contributed to North Pacific climate anomalies include large-scale Pacific Ocean circulation changes ({cite.5.'Saenko_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Schmittner_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Harada_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Okazaki_et_al_2010}) during phases of a weak AMOC. Recent high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} studies (EPICA Community Members, 2006; {cite.5.'Capron_et_al_2010a}, 2010b, 2012; {cite.5.'Stenni_et_al_2011}) show that Antarctica warmed gradually for most GS, reaching maximum values at the time of GS/GI transitions, which is in agreement with the bipolar seesaw concept ({cite.5.'Stocker_and_Johnsen_2003}; {cite.5.'Stenni_et_al_2011}). A recent global temperature compilation ({cite.5.'Shakun_et_al_2012}), Southern Ocean temperature records ({cite.5.'Lamy_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Barker_et_al_2009}; De Deckker et al., 2012), evidence from SH terrestrial records ({cite.5.'Kaplan_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Putnam_et_al_2010}) and transient climate model experiments ({cite.5.'Menviel_et_al_2011}) provide {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence} for the inter-hemispheric character of millennial-scale variability during the last {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination glacial termination} and for DO events (high confidence).

Newly available marine records ({cite.5.'Martrat_et_al_2007}; Grützner and Higgins, 2010; {cite.5.'Margari_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Kleiven_et_al_2011}), Antarctic {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} records ({cite.5.'Loulergue_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Schilt_et_al_2010}) and statistical analyses of Antarctic ice core data ({cite.5.'Siddall_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Lambert_et_al_2012}) combined with bipolar seesaw modelling ({cite.5.'Siddall_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Barker_et_al_2011}) document with high confidence that abrupt climate change events, similar to the DO events and Heinrich stadials of the last glacial cycle, occurred during previous glacial periods extending back about 800 ka and, with medium confidence, to 1100 ka.
