title: 5.3.2.2 - Last Glacial Termination

It is very likely that global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} increased by 3°C to 8°C over the last {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} (see {'Table_5_2 Table 5.2}), which gives a very likely average rate of change of 0.3 to 0.8°C kyr–1. Deglacial global warming occurred in two main steps from 17.5 to 14.5 ka and 13.0 to 10.0 ka that likely reached maximum rates of change between 1°C kyr–1 and 1.5°C kyr–1 at the millennial time scale (cf. {cite.5.'Shakun_et_al_2012}; {'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}i), although regionally and on shorter time scales higher rates may have occurred, in particular during a sequence of {Glossary.*Abrupt_climate_change abrupt climate change} events (see {Chapters.5.5_7 Section 5.7}).

For the last glacial termination, a large-scale temperature {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} ({cite.5.'Shakun_et_al_2012}) documents that temperature change in the SH lead NH temperature change. This lead can be explained by the bipolar thermal seesaw concept ({cite.5.'Stocker_and_Johnsen_2003}) (see also {Chapters.5.5_7 Section 5.7}) and the related changes in the inter-hemispheric ocean heat transport, caused by weakening of the Atlantic Ocean {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation meridional overturning circulation} (AMOC) during the last glacial termination ({cite.5.'Ganopolski_and_Roche_2009}). SH warming prior to NH warming can also be explained by the fast {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} response to changes in austral spring {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} ({cite.5.'Stott_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Timmermann_et_al_2009}). According to these mechanisms, SH temperature lead over the NH is fully consistent with the NH orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} of deglacial ice volume changes (high confidence) and the importance of the climate–{Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} feedbacks in glacial–interglacial transitions. The tight coupling is further highlighted by the near-zero lag between the deglacial rise in {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} and averaged deglacial Antarctic temperature recently reported from improved estimates of gas-{Glossary.*Ice_age ice age} differences ({cite.5.'Pedro_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Parrenin_et_al_2013}). Previous studies ({cite.5.'Monnin_et_al_2001}; Table 5.A.4) suggesting a temperature lead of 800 ± 600 years over the deglacial CO2 rise probably overestimated gas-ice age differences.
