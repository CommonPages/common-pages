title: 5.3.5.1 - Recent Warming in the Context of New Reconstructions

New {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} efforts since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({'Figure_5_7 Figure 5.7}; {'Table_5_4 Table 5.4}; Appendix 5.A.1) have provided further insights into the characteristics of the Medieval Climate Anomaly ({Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA}; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) and the Little Ice Age ({Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA}; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}). The timing and spatial structure of the MCA and LIA are complex (see {Box_6_4 Box 6.4} in AR4 and {cite.5.'Diaz_et_al_2011}; and {Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5}), with different reconstructions exhibiting warm and cold conditions at different times for different regions and seasons. The median of the NH temperature reconstructions ({'Figure_5_7 Figure 5.7}) indicates mostly warm conditions from about 950 to about 1250 and colder conditions from about 1450 to about 1850; these time intervals are chosen here to represent the MCA and the LIA, respectively.

Based on {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence} (using different statistical methods or different compilations of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records; see Appendix 5.A.1 for a description of reconstructions and selection criteria), published reconstructions and their uncertainty estimates indicate, with high confidence, that the mean NH temperature of the last 30 or 50 years very likely exceeded any previous 30or 50-year mean during the past 800 years ({'Table_5_4 Table 5.4}). The timing of warm and cold periods is mostly consistent across reconstructions (in some cases this is because they use similar proxy compilations) but the magnitude of the changes is clearly sensitive to the statistical method and to the target domain (land or land and sea; the full hemisphere or only the extra-tropics; {'Figure_5_7 Figure 5.7}a). Even accounting for these {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, almost all reconstructions agree that each 30-year (50-year) period from 1200 to 1899 was very likely colder in the NH than the 1983–2012 (1963–2012) instrumental temperature.

NH reconstructions covering part or all of the first millennium suggest that some earlier 50-year periods might have been as warm as the 1963–2012 mean instrumental temperature, but the higher temperature of the last 30 years appear to be at least likely the warmest 30-year period in all reconstructions ({'Table_5_4 Table 5.4}). However, the confidence in this finding is lower prior to 1200, because the evidence is less reliable and there are fewer independent lines of evidence. There are fewer proxy records, thus yielding less independence among the reconstructions while making them more susceptible to errors in individual proxy records. The published uncertainty ranges do not include all sources of error ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_2 Section 5.3.5.2}), and some proxy records and uncertainty estimates do not fully represent variations on time scales as short as the 30 years considered in {'Table_5_4 Table 5.4}. Considering these caveats, there is medium confidence that the last 30 years were likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years.

Increasing numbers of proxy records and regional reconstructions are being developed for the SH (see {Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5}), but few reconstructions of SH or global mean temperatures have been published ({'Figure_5_7 Figure 5.7}b, c). The SH and global reconstructions with published uncertainty estimates indicate that each 30 or 50-year interval during the last four centuries was very likely colder than the warmest 30 or 50-year interval after 1900 ({'Table_5_4 Table 5.4}). However, there is only limited proxy evidence and therefore low confidence that the recent warming has exceeded the range of reconstructed temperatures for the SH and global scales.
