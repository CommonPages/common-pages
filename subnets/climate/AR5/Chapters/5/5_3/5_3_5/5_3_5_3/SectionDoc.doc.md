title: 5.3.5.3 - Comparing Reconstructions and Simulations

The number of {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations of the last millennium has increased since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (Fernández-Donado et al., 2013). The simulations have used different estimates of natural and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcings} (Table 5.A.1). In particular, the PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations are driven by smaller long-term changes in {Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1 Section 5.2.1}; {'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}b): TSI increases by ≤0.10% from the Late Maunder Minimum (LMM; 1675–1715) to the late 20th century ({cite.5.'Schmidt_et_al_2011}), while most previous simulations use increases between 0.23% and 0.29% (Fernández-Donado et al., 2013). Simulated NH temperatures during the last millennium lie mostly within the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} of the available reconstructions ({'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}a). This agreement between GCM simulations and reconstructions provides neither strong constraints on forcings nor on model sensitivities because {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} and uncertainties in the forcings and reconstructions are considerable factors.

Data have also been assimilated into {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} (see Sections {Chapters.5.5_5 5.5} and {Chapters.10.10_7 10.7}, {'Figure_10_19 Figure 10.19}) by either nudging simulations to follow local or regional {Glossary.*Proxy proxy}-based reconstructions ({cite.5.'Widmann_et_al_2010}) or by selecting simulations from decade-by-decade ensembles to obtain the closest match to reconstructed climate patterns ({cite.5.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2012}; {cite.5.'Goosse_et_al_2012a}). The resulting simulations provide insight into the relative roles of internal variability and {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} ({cite.5.'Goosse_et_al_2012b}), and processes that may account for the spatial distribution of {Topics.*Past_Climate past climate} anomalies ({cite.5.'Crespin_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Palastanga_et_al_2011}).

{'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}b–d provides additional tests of model-data agreement by compositing the temperature response to a number of distinct forcing events. The models simulate a significant NH cooling in response to volcanic events ({'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}b; peaks between 0.1°C and 0.5°C depending on model) that lasts 3 to 5 years, overlapping with the signal inferred from reconstructions with annual {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} (0.05°C to 0.3°C). CMIP5 simulations tend to overestimate cooling following the major 1809 and 1815 eruptions relative to early instrumental data ({cite.5.'Brohan_et_al_2012}). Such differences could arise from uncertainties in volcanic forcing ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1.5_2_1_3 Section 5.2.1.3}) and its implementation in climate models ({cite.5.'Joshi_and_Jones_2009}) or from errors in the reconstructions ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_2 Section 5.3.5.2}). Since many reconstructions do not have annual resolution, similar composites ({'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}c) are formed to show the response to changes in multi-decadal volcanic forcings (representing clusters of eruptions). Both the simulated and reconstructed responses are significant and comparable in magnitude, although simulations show a faster recovery (<5 years) than reconstructions. Solar forcing estimated over the last millennium shows weaker variations than volcanic forcing ({'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}d), even at multi-decadal time scales. Compositing the response to multi-decadal fluctuations in solar irradiance shows cooling in simulations and reconstructions of NH temperature between 0.0°C and 0.15°C. In both cases, the cooling may be partly a response to concurrent variations in volcanic forcing (green line in {'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}d).

Temperature differences between the warmest and coolest centennial or multi-centennial periods provide an additional comparison of the amplitude of NH temperature variations in the reconstructions and simulations: between 950 and 1250 (nominally the {Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA}) and 1450– 1850 (nominally the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA}; {'Figure_5_8 Figures 5.8}e; 5.9a–c) and between the LIA and the 20th century ({'Figure_5_8 Figures 5.8}f; 5.9g–i). Despite similar multi-model and multi-{Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} means for the warming from the LIA to the present, the range of individual results is very wide (see Sections {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_1 9.5.3.1} and {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_1 10.7.1} for a comparison of reconstructed and simulated variability across various frequency ranges) and there is no clear difference between runs with weaker or stronger solar forcing ({'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}f; {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_2 Section 10.7.2}). The difference between the MCA and LIA temperatures, however, has a smaller range for the model simulations than the reconstructions, and the simulations (especially those with weaker solar forcing) lie within the lower half of the reconstructed range of temperature changes ({'Figure_5_8 Figure 5.8}e). Recent studies have assessed the consistency of model simulations and temperature reconstructions at the hemispheric scale. {cite.5.'Hind_and_Moberg_2012 Hind and Moberg (2012)} found closer data-model agreement for simulations with 0.1% TSI increase than 0.24% TSI increase, but the result is sensitive to the reconstruction uncertainty and the {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} of the model. Simulations with an {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMIC} using a much stronger solar forcing (0.44% TSI increase from LMM to present, {cite.5.'Shapiro_et_al_2011}) appear to be incompatible with most temperature reconstructions ({cite.5.'Feulner_2011}).

The spatial distributions of simulated and reconstructed ({cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Ljungqvist_et_al_2012}) temperature changes between the MCA, LIA and 20th century are shown in {'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}. Simulated changes tend to be larger, particularly with stronger TSI forcing, over the continents and ice/snow-covered regions, showing polar amplification (see {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}). The largest simulated and reconstructed changes are between the LIA and present, with reconstructions ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}i) indicating widespread warming except for the cooling south of Greenland. Models also simulate overall warming between the MCA and present ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}d, e), whereas the reconstructions indicate significant regional cooling (in the North Atlantic, southeastern North America, and the mid-latitudes of the Pacific Ocean). This is not surprising because greater regional variability is expected in the reconstructions compared with the mean of multiple model simulations, though reconstructed changes for such areas with few or no proxy data ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}i) should also be interpreted with caution ({cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2011}). The reconstructed temperature differences between MCA and LIA ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}c) indicate higher medieval temperatures over the NH continents in agreement with simulations ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}a, b). The reconstructed MCA warming is higher than in the simulations, even for stronger TSI changes and individual simulations (Fernández-Donado et al., 2013). Simulations with proxy assimilation show that this pattern of change is compatible with a direct response to a relatively weak solar forcing and internal variability patterns similar to a positive Northern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM}) phase and northward shifts of the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream currents ({cite.5.'Goosse_et_al_2012b}). For the tropical regions, an enhanced zonal {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradient produced by either a warmer Indian Ocean ({cite.5.'Graham_et_al_2011}) or a cooler eastern Pacific ({Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña}-like state) ({cite.5.'Seager_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2009}) could explain the reconstructed MCA patterns ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}c). However, the enhanced gradients are not reproduced by model simulations ({'Figure_5_9 Figure 5.9}a, b) and are not robust when considering the reconstruction uncertainties and the limited proxy records in these tropical ocean regions (Emile-Geay et al., 2013b) (Sections {Chapters.5.5_4.5_4_1 5.4.1} and {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1 5.5.1}). This precludes an assessment of the role of external forcing and/or internal variability in these reconstructed patterns.
