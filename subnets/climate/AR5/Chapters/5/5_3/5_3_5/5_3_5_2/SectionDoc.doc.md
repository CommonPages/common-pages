title: 5.3.5.2 - Reconstruction Methods, Limitations and Uncertainties

Reconstructing NH, SH or global-mean temperature variations over the last 2000 years remains a challenge due to limitations of spatial sampling, {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in individual {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records and challenges associated with the statistical methods used to calibrate and integrate multi-proxy information ({cite.5.'Hughes_and_Ammann_2009}; {cite.5.'Jones_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Frank_et_al_2010a}). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, new assessments of the statistical methods used to reconstruct either global/hemispheric temperature averages or spatial fields of past temperature anomalies have been published. The former include approaches for simple compositing and scaling of local or regional proxy records into global and hemispheric averages using uniform or proxy-dependent weighting ({cite.5.'Hegerl_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Juckes_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Christiansen_and_Ljungqvist_2012}). The latter correspond to improvements in climate field {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} methods ({cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2011}) that apply temporal and spatial relationships between instrumental and proxy records to the pre-instrumental period. New developments for both reconstruction approaches include implementations of Bayesian inference ({cite.5.'Li_et_al_2010a}; {cite.5.'Tingley_and_Huybers_2010}, 2012; {cite.5.'McShane_and_Wyner_2011}; {cite.5.'Werner_et_al_2013}). In particular, Bayesian hierarchical models enable a more explicit representation of the underlying processes that relate proxy (and instrumental) records to climate, allowing a more systematic treatment of the multiple uncertainties that affect the climate reconstruction process. This is done by specifying simple parametric forms for the proxy-temperature relationships that are then used to estimate a probability distribution of the reconstructed temperature evolution that is compatible with the available data ({cite.5.'Tingley_et_al_2012}).

An improved understanding of potential uncertainties and biases associated with reconstruction methods has been achieved, particularly by using millennial {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations as a surrogate reality in which pseudo-proxy records are created and reconstruction methods are replicated and tested ({cite.5.'Smerdon_2012}). A key finding is that the methods used for many published reconstructions can underestimate the amplitude of the low-frequency variability ({cite.5.'Lee_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Christiansen_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2010}). The magnitude of this amplitude attenuation in real-world reconstructions is uncertain, but for affected methods the problem will be larger: (i) for cases with weaker correlation between instrumental temperatures and proxies ({cite.5.'Lee_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Christiansen_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2011}); (ii) if errors in the proxy data are not incorporated correctly ({cite.5.'Hegerl_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Ammann_et_al_2010}); or (iii) if the data are detrended in the calibration phase ({cite.5.'Lee_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Christiansen_et_al_2009}). The 20th-century trends in proxies may contain relevant temperature information ({cite.5.'Ammann_and_Wahl_2007}) but calibration with detrended or undetrended data has been an issue of debate (von Storch et al., 2006; {cite.5.'Wahl_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2007}) because trends in proxy records can be induced by other (non-temperature) climate and non-climatic influences ({cite.5.'Jones_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Gagen_et_al_2011}). Recent developments mitigate the loss of low-frequency variance in global and hemispheric reconstructions by increasing the correlation between proxies and temperature through temporal smoothing ({cite.5.'Lee_et_al_2008}) or by correctly attributing part or all of the temperature-proxy differences to imperfect proxy data ({cite.5.'Hegerl_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Juckes_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2008}). Pseudoproxy experiments have shown that the latter approach used with a site-by-site calibration ({cite.5.'Christiansen_2011}; {cite.5.'Christiansen_and_Ljungqvist_2012}) can also avoid attenuation of low-frequency variability, though it is debated whether it might instead inflate the variability and thus constitute an upper bound for low-frequency variability ({cite.5.'Moberg_2013}). Even those field reconstruction methods that do not attenuate the low-frequency variability of global or hemispheric means may still suffer from attenuation and other errors at regional scales ({cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2012}; {cite.5.'Smerdon_2012}; {cite.5.'Werner_et_al_2013}).

The fundamental limitations for deriving past temperature variability at global/hemispheric scales are the relatively short instrumental period and the number, temporal and geographical distribution, reliability and climate signal of proxy records ({cite.5.'Jones_et_al_2009}). The database of high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} proxies has been expanded since AR4 ({cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Wahl_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Neukom_and_Gergis_2011}; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013), but data are still sparse in the tropics, SH and over the oceans (see new developments in {Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5}). Integration of low-resolution records (e.g., marine or some lake sediment cores and some speleothem records) with high-resolution tree-ring, {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} and coral records in global/hemispheric reconstructions is still challenging. Dating uncertainty, limited replication and the possibility of temporal lags in low-resolution records ({cite.5.'Jones_et_al_2009}) make regression-based calibration particularly difficult ({cite.5.'Christiansen_et_al_2009}) and can be potentially best addressed in the future with Bayesian hierarchical models ({cite.5.'Tingley_et_al_2012}). The short instrumental period and the paucity of proxy data in specific regions may preclude obtaining accurate estimates of the covariance of temperature and proxy records ({cite.5.'Juckes_et_al_2007}), impacting the selection and weighting of proxy records in global/hemispheric reconstructions (Bürger, 2007; {cite.5.'Osborn_and_Briffa_2007}; Emile-Geay et al., 2013b) and resulting in regional errors in climate field reconstructions ({cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2011}).

Two further sources of uncertainty have been only partially considered in the published literature. First, some studies have used multiple statistical models ({cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2008}) or generated ensembles of reconstructions by sampling parameter space ({cite.5.'Frank_et_al_2010b}), but this type of structural and parameter uncertainty needs further examination ({cite.5.'Christiansen_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Smerdon_et_al_2011}). Second, proxy-temperature relationships may change over time due to the effect of other climate and non-climate influences on a proxy, a prominent example being the divergence between some tree-ring width and density chronologies and instrumental temperature trends during the last decades of the 20th century ({cite.5.'Briffa_et_al_1998}). In cases that do show divergence, a number of factors may be responsible, such as direct temperature or {Glossary.*Drought drought} stress on trees, delayed snowmelt, changes in seasonality and reductions in {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} ({cite.5.'Lloyd_and_Bunn_2007}; D’Arrigo et al., 2008; {cite.5.'Porter_and_Pisaric_2011}). However, this phenomenon does not affect all tree-ring records ({cite.5.'Wilson_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Esper_and_Frank_2009}) and in some cases where divergence is apparent it may arise from the use of inappropriate statistical standardization of the data ({cite.5.'Melvin_and_Briffa_2008}; {cite.5.'Briffa_and_Melvin_2011}) and not from a genuine change in the proxy–temperature relationship. For the European Alps and Siberia, Büntgen et al., (2008) and {cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2010 Esper et al. (2010)} demonstrate that divergence can be avoided by careful selection of sites and standardization methods together with large sample replication.

Limitations in proxy data and reconstruction methods suggest that published uncertainties will underestimate the full range of uncertainties of large-scale temperature reconstructions (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_1 Section 5.3.5.1}). While this has fostered debate about the extent to which proxy-based reconstructions provide useful climate information (e.g., {cite.5.'McShane_and_Wyner_2011} and associated comments and rejoinder), it is well established that temperature and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} signals are detectable in proxy reconstructions (Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_3 5.3.5.3} and {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_2 10.7.2}). Recently, {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} assuming a nonlinear sensitivity of tree-rings to climate ({cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2012}) have been used to suggest that the tree-ring response to volcanic cooling may be attenuated and lagged. Tree-ring data and additional tree-growth model assessments ({cite.5.'Anchukaitis_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2013}) have challenged this interpretation and analyses of instrumental data suggest hemispheric temperature reconstructions agree well with the degree of volcanic cooling during early 19th-century volcanic events ({cite.5.'Brohan_et_al_2012}; see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5.5_3_5_3 Section 5.3.5.3}). These lines of evidence leave the representation of volcanic events in tree-ring records and associated hemispheric scale temperature reconstructions as an emerging area of investigation.
