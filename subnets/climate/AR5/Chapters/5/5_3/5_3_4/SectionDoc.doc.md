title: 5.3.4 - Past Interglacials

Past {Glossary.*Interglacials_or_interglaciations interglacials} are characterized by different combinations of orbital forcing ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1.5_2_1_1 Section 5.2.1.1}), atmospheric composition ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_1 Section 5.2.2.1}) and climate responses ({cite.5.'Tzedakis_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Lang_and_Wolff_2011}). Documenting natural interglacial {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} in the past provides a deeper understanding of the physical climate responses to orbital forcing. This section reports on interglacials of the past 800 kyr, with emphasis on the Last Interglacial ({Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG}, {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) which has more data and modelling studies for assessing regional and global temperature changes than earlier interglacials. The LIG {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} responses are assessed in {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_2 Section 5.6.2}. {Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5} is devoted to the current interglacial, the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene}.

The phasing and strengths of the precessional parameter and obliquity varied over past interglacials ({'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}b, c), influencing their timing, duration, and intensity ({cite.5.'Tzedakis_et_al_2012b}; {cite.5.'Yin_and_Berger_2012}) ({'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}e, f, h). Since 800 ka, atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations during interglacials were systematically higher than during glacial periods. Prior to ~430 ka, ice cores from Antarctica record lower interglacial CO2 concentrations than for the subsequent interglacial periods ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_1 Section 5.2.2.1}; {'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}d). While LIG {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} concentrations were similar to the pre-industrial Holocene values, orbital conditions were very different with larger latitudinal and seasonal {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} variations. Large eccentricity and the phasing of precession and obliquity ({'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}a–c) during the LIG resulted in July 65°N insolation peaking at ~126 ka and staying above the Holocene maximum values from ~129 to 123 ka. The high obliquity ({'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}b) contributed to small, but positive annual insolation anomalies at high latitudes in both hemispheres and negative anomalies at low latitudes.

New data and syntheses from marine and terrestrial archives, with updated age models, have provided an expanded view of temperature patterns during interglacials since 800 ka (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010a; {cite.5.'Lang_and_Wolff_2011}; {cite.5.'Rohling_et_al_2012}). There is currently no consensus on whether interglacials changed intensity after ~430 ka. EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice cores record warmer temperatures after this transition ({cite.5.'Jouzel_et_al_2007}) and marine records of deep-water temperatures are characterized by generally higher values during later interglacials than earlier interglacials ({cite.5.'Lang_and_Wolff_2011}). In contrast, similar interglacial magnitudes are observed across the ~430 ka boundary in some terrestrial archives from Eurasia ({cite.5.'Prokopenko_et_al_2002}; {cite.5.'Tzedakis_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Candy_et_al_2010}). Simulations with an EMIC relate global and southern high latitude mean annual {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} variations to changes in CO2 variations, while orbital forcing and associated feedbacks of vegetation and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} have a major impact on the simulated northern high-latitude mean annual surface temperature ({cite.5.'Yin_and_Berger_2012}). The highest and lowest interglacial temperatures occur in models when {Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG} concentrations and local insolation reinforce each other ({cite.5.'Yin_and_Berger_2010}, 2012; {cite.5.'Herold_et_al_2012}).

At the time of the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, a compilation of Arctic records and two AOGCM simulations allowed an assessment of LIG summer temperature changes. New quantitative data syntheses ({'Figure_5_6 Figure 5.6}a) now allow estimation of maximum annual {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} around the globe for the LIG ({cite.5.'Turney_and_Jones_2010}; {cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2011}). A caveat is that these data syntheses assume that the warmest phases were globally synchronous (see {'Figure_5_6 Figure 5.6} legend for details). However, there is high confidence that warming in the Southern Ocean ({cite.5.'Cortese_et_al_2007}; Schneider Mor et al., 2012) and over Antarctica (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010b) occurred prior to peak warmth in the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas, and Greenland ({cite.5.'Bauch_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Govin_et_al_2012}; North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) community members, 2013). Overall, higher annual temperatures than pre-industrial are reconstructed for high latitudes of both hemispheres. At ~128 ka, East Antarctic ice cores record early peak temperatures ~5°C above the present ({cite.5.'Jouzel_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Sime_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Stenni_et_al_2010}). Higher temperatures are derived for northern Eurasia and Alaska, with sites near the Arctic coast in Northeast Siberia indicating warming of more than 10°C as compared to late Holocene ({cite.5.'Velichko_et_al_2008}). Greenland warming of 8°C ± 4°C at 126 ka is estimated from the new Greenland NEEM {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core}, after accounting for {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} elevation changes (NEEM community members, 2013). Seasonally open waters off northern Greenland and in the central Arctic are recorded during the LIG (Nørgaard-Pedersen et al., 2007; {cite.5.'Adler_et_al_2009}). Changes in Arctic sea ice cover ({cite.5.'Sime_et_al_2013}) may have affected the Greenland water stable isotope – temperature relationship, adding some {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} to LIG Greenland temperature reconstructions. Marine proxies from the Atlantic indicate warmer than late Holocene year-round SSTs north of 30°N, whereas {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} changes were more variable south of this latitude ({cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2011}).

Transient LIG simulations with {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} and low-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} display peak NH summer warmth between 128 ka and 125 ka in response to orbital and WMGHG {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}. This warming is delayed when NH ice sheets are allowed to evolve ({cite.5.'Bakker_et_al_2013}). Time-slice climate simulations run by 13 modelling groups with a hierarchy of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} forced with orbital and WMGHG changes for 128 to 125 ka ({'Figure_5_6 Figure 5.6}b) simulate the reconstructed pattern of NH annual warming ({'Figure_5_6 Figure 5.6}a). Positive feedbacks with the {Topics.*Climate_System cryosphere} (sea ice and snow cover) provide the memory that allows simulated NH high-latitude warming, annually as well as seasonally, in response to the seasonal orbital forcing ({cite.5.'Schurgers_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Yin_and_Berger_2012}). The magnitude of observed NH annual warming though is only reached in summer in the simulations ({cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2013}) ({'Figure_5_6 Figure 5.6}c, d). The reasons for this discrepancy are not yet fully determined. Error bars on temperature reconstructions vary significantly between methods and regions, due to the effects of seasonality and resolution ({cite.5.'Kienast_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Tarasov_et_al_2011}). Differences may also be related to model representations of cloud and sea ice processes ({cite.5.'Born_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Fischer_and_Jungclaus_2010}; {cite.5.'Kim_et_al_2010}; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2013), and that most LIG simulations set the vegetation and ice sheets to their pre-industrial states ({cite.5.'Schurgers_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Holden_et_al_2010b}; {cite.5.'Bradley_et_al_2013}). Simulations accounting for the bipolar seesaw response to persistent iceberg melting at high northern latitudes ({cite.5.'Govin_et_al_2012}) and disintegration of the WAIS ({cite.5.'Overpeck_et_al_2006}) (see {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_2.5_6_2_3 Section 5.6.2.3}) are better able to reproduce the early LIG Antarctic warming ({cite.5.'Holden_et_al_2010b}).

From data synthesis, the LIG global mean annual surface temperature is estimated to be ~1°C to 2°C warmer than pre-industrial (medium confidence) ({cite.5.'Turney_and_Jones_2010}; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2013), albeit {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} reconstructions may overestimate the global temperature change. High latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, was at least 2°C warmer than present (high confidence). In response to orbital forcing and WMGHG concentration changes, time slice simulations for 128 to 125 ka exhibit global mean annual surface temperature changes of 0.0°C ± 0.5°C as compared to pre-industrial. Data and models suggest a land–ocean contrast in the responses to the LIG forcing ({'Figure_5_6 Figure 5.6}c, d). Peak global annual SST warming is estimated from data to be 0.7°C ± 0.6°C (medium confidence) ({cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2011}). Models give more confidence to the lower bound. The {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of climate model simulations gives a large range of global annual land temperature change relative to pre-industrial, –0.4°C to 1.7°C, when sampled at the data locations and cooler than when averaged for all model land areas, pointing to difficulties in estimating global mean annual surface temperature with current spatial data coverage (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2013).
