title: 5.3.1 - High-Carbon Dioxide Worlds and Temperature

Cenozoic (last 65 Ma) geological archives provide examples of natural climate states globally warmer than the present, which are associated with atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations above pre-industrial levels. This relationship between global warmth and high CO2 is complicated by factors such as tectonics and the evolution of biological systems, which play an important role in the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} (e.g., {cite.5.'Zachos_et_al_2008}). Although new reconstructions of deep-ocean temperatures have been compiled since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (e.g., {cite.5.'Cramer_et_al_2011}), low confidence remains in the precise relationship between CO2 and deep-ocean temperature ({cite.5.'Beerling_and_Royer_2011}).

Since AR4 new {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} and model data have become available from three Cenozoic warm periods to enable an assessment of forcing, feedbacks and the {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} response (e.g., {cite.5.'Dowsett_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}). These are the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}), the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) and the mid-{Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} Warm Period (MPWP; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}). Reconstructions of {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} based on proxy data remain challenged by (i) the limited number and uneven geographical distribution of sites, (ii) seasonal biases and (iii) the validity of assumptions required by each proxy method (assessed in Table 5.A.3). There is also a lack of consistency in the way {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are reported for proxy climate estimates. In most cases error bars represent the analytical and calibration error. In some compilations qualitative confidence assessments are reported to account for the quality of the age control, number of samples, fossil preservation and abundance, performance of the proxy method utilized and agreement of multiple proxy estimates (e.g., Multiproxy Approach for the {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable Reconstruction} of the Glacial Ocean surface (MARGO) Project Members, 2009; {cite.5.'Dowsett_et_al_2012}).

The PETM was marked by a massive carbon release and corresponding global {Glossary.*Ocean_acidification ocean acidification} ({cite.5.'Zachos_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Ridgwell_and_Schmidt_2010}) and, with low confidence, global warming of 4°C to 7°C relative to pre-PETM mean climate ({cite.5.'Sluijs_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'McInerney_and_Wing_2011}). The carbon release of 4500 to 6800 PgC over 5 to 20 kyr translates into a rate of {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of ~0.5 to 1.0 PgC yr–1 ({cite.5.'Panchuk_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Zeebe_et_al_2009}). GHG emissions from marine methane hydrate and terrestrial {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} may have acted as positive feedbacks ({cite.5.'DeConto_et_al_2012}).

The EECO represents the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have reached a level of ~1000 ppm ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_2 Section 5.2.2.2}). There were no substantial polar ice sheets, and oceanic and continental configurations, vegetation type and distribution were significantly different from today. Whereas simulated SAT are in reasonable agreement with reconstructions ({cite.5.'Huber_and_Caballero_2011}; {cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2012}) ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}d), there are still significant discrepancies between simulated and reconstructed mean annual {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}, which are reduced if seasonal biases in some of the marine proxies are considered for the high-latitude sites ({cite.5.'Hollis_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2012}). Medium confidence is placed on the reconstructed {Glossary.*Global_mean_surface_temperature global mean surface temperature} anomaly estimate of 9°C to 14°C.

The Pliocene is characterized by a long-term increase in global ice volume and decrease in temperature from ~3.3–2.6 Ma ({cite.5.'Lisiecki_and_Raymo_2005}; {cite.5.'Mudelsee_and_Raymo_2005}; {cite.5.'Fedorov_et_al_2013}), which marks the onset of continental-scale glaciations in the NH. Superimposed on this {Glossary.*Trend trend}, benthic d18O ({cite.5.'Lisiecki_and_Raymo_2005}) and an ice proximal geological archive ({cite.5.'Lisiecki_and_Raymo_2005}; {cite.5.'Naish_et_al_2009a}) imply moderate fluctuations in global ice volume paced by the 41 kyr obliquity cycle. This orbital variability is also evident in far-field {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} reconstructions ({cite.5.'Miller_et_al_2012a}), tropical Pacific SST ({cite.5.'Herbert_et_al_2010}) and Southern Ocean MDA records (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011), and indicate a close coupling between temperature, atmospheric circulation and ice volume/sea level ({'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}). The MPWP and the following 300 kyr represent the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were in the range 350 to 450 ppm ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_2 Section 5.2.2.2}, {'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}). Model–data comparisons ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}) provide high confidence that mean surface temperature was warmer than pre-industrial for the average interglacial climate state during the MPWP ({cite.5.'Dowsett_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}). Global mean SST is estimated at +1.7°C (without uncertainty) above the 1901–1920 mean based on large data syntheses ({cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Dowsett_et_al_2012}). {Glossary.*General_circulation General circulation} model (GCM) results agree with this SST anomaly (to within ±0.5°C), and produce a range of global mean SAT of +1.9°C and +3.6°C relative to the 1901–1920 mean ({cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}). Weakened meridional temperature gradients are shown by all GCM simulations, and have significant implications for the stability of polar ice sheets and sea level (see {Box_5_1 Box 5.1} and {Chapters.5.5_6 Section 5.6}). SST gradients and the Pacific Ocean {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} gradient along the equator were greatly reduced compared to present ({cite.5.'Fedorov_et_al_2013}) ({Chapters.5.5_4 Section 5.4}). Vegetation reconstructions ({cite.5.'Salzmann_et_al_2008}) imply that the global extent of arid deserts decreased and boreal forests replaced tundra, and {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} predict an enhanced {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle}, but with large inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} ({cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}). The East Asian Summer {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon}, as well as other monsoon systems, may have been enhanced at this time (e.g., {cite.5.'Wan_et_al_2010}).

Climate reconstructions for the warm periods of the Cenozoic also provide an opportunity to assess Earth-system and equilibrium climate sensitivities. Uncertainties on both global temperature and CO2 reconstructions preclude deriving robust quantitative estimates from the available PETM data. The limited number of models for MPWP, which take into account slow feedbacks such as ice sheets and the carbon cycle, imply with medium confidence that Earth-system sensitivity may be up to two times the model equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (ECS) ({cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Pagani_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}). However, if the slow amplifying feedbacks associated with ice sheets and CO2 are considered as {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} rather than feedbacks, climate records of the past 65 Myr yield an estimate of 1.1°C to 7°C (95% confidence interval) for ECS (PALAEOSENS Project Members, 2012) (see also {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_2 Section 5.3.3.2}).
