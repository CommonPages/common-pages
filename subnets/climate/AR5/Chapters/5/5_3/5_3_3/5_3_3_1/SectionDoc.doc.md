title: 5.3.3.1 - Last Glacial Maximum Climate

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, synthesis of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} temperature estimates was completed for {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} (MARGO Project Members, 2009), and for land SAT ({cite.5.'Bartlein_et_al_2011}) ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}). The Multiproxy Approach for the {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable Reconstruction} of the Glacial Ocean Surface (MARGO) SST synthesis expanded earlier work (CLIMAP Project Members, 1976, 1981; {cite.5.'Sarnthein_et_al_2003a}; {cite.5.'Sarnthein_et_al_2003b}) by using multiple proxies ({'Table_5_2 Table 5.2}). The land SAT synthesis is based on pollen data, following the Cooperative {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} Mapping Project (COHMAP Members, 1988).

{Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} and proxy data consistently show that mean annual SST change (relative to pre-industrial) is largest in the mid-latitude North Atlantic (up to –10oC), and the Mediterranean (about –6oC) (MARGO Project Members, 2009, {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Table_5_2 Table 5.2}). Warming and seasonally ice-free conditions are reconstructed, however, in the northeastern North Atlantic, in the eastern Nordic Seas and north Pacific, albeit with large uncertainty because of the different interpretation of proxy data (de Vernal et al., 2006). SAT reconstructions generally shows year-round cooling, with regional exceptions such as Alaska ({cite.5.'Bartlein_et_al_2011}). Modelling studies show how atmospheric dynamics influenced by ice sheets affect regional temperature patterns in the North Atlantic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} (Lainé et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Pausata_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Unterman_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Hofer_et_al_2013}), and in the north Pacific region (Yanase and Abe-Ouchi, 2010). Larger cooling over land compared to ocean is a robust feature of observations and multiple {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}–ocean {Glossary.*General_circulation general circulation} models (AOGCM) ({cite.5.'Izumi_et_al_2013}). As in AR4, central Greenland temperature change during the LGM is underestimated by PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations, which show 2°C to 18°C cooling, compared to 21°C to 25°C cooling reconstructed from {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} data ({'Table_5_2 Table 5.2}). A mismatch between reconstructions and model results may arise because of missing {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} feedbacks (dust, vegetation) (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_3 Section 5.2.2.3}) or insufficient integration time to reach an equilibrium for LGM boundary conditions.

Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of tropical SST cooling during the LGM. Previous estimates of tropical cooling (2.7°C ± 0.5°C, {cite.5.'Ballantyne_et_al_2005}) are greater than more recent estimates (1.5°C ± 1.2°C, MARGO Project Members, 2009). Such discrepancies may arise from seasonal productivity ({cite.5.'Leduc_et_al_2010}) and habitat depth ({cite.5.'Telford_et_al_2013}) biases. In the western and eastern tropical Pacific, many proxy records show 2°C to 3°C cooling relative to the pre-industrial period ({cite.5.'Lea_et_al_2000}, 2006; de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2007; {cite.5.'Leduc_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Pahnke_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Stott_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Koutavas_and_Sachs_2008}; {cite.5.'Steinke_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Linsley_et_al_2010}). {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCMs} tend to underestimate longitudinal patterns of tropical SST (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2009) and atmospheric circulation ({cite.5.'DiNezio_et_al_2011}).

Larger {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} seasonality is reconstructed for the LGM compared to the pre-industrial period around Antarctica ({cite.5.'Gersonde_et_al_2005}). Climate models underestimate this feature, as well as the magnitude of Southern Ocean cooling ({cite.5.'Roche_et_al_2012}) (see {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}). In Antarctica 7°C to 10°C cooling relative to the pre-industrial period is reconstructed from ice cores ({cite.5.'Stenni_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Uemura_et_al_2012}) and captured in most PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations ({'Figure_5_5 Figure 5.5}d).

The combined use of proxy reconstructions, with incomplete spatial coverage, and model simulations is used to estimate LGM global mean temperature change ({'Table_5_2 Table 5.2}). One recent such study, combining multi-proxy data with multiple AOGCMs, estimates LGM global cooling at 4.0°C ± 0.8°C (95% confidence interval) ({cite.5.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2013}). This result contrasts with the wider range of global cooling (1.7°C to 8.3°C) obtained using Earth-system models of intermediate complexity ({Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMIC}) (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2006; {cite.5.'Holden_et_al_2010b}; {cite.5.'Schmittner_et_al_2011}). The {Glossary.*Source source} of these differences in the estimate of LGM cooling may be the result of (i) the proxy data used to constrain the simulations, such as data sets associated with mild cooling in the tropics and the North Atlantic; (ii) model {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} and structure, which affects their ability to resolve the land–sea contrast ({cite.5.'Annan_and_Hargreaves_2013}) and polar amplification ({cite.5.'Fyke_and_Eby_2012}); (iii) the experimental design of the simulations, where the lack of dust and vegetation feedbacks ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_3 Section 5.2.2.3}) and insufficient integration time. Based on the results and the caveats in the studies assessed here ({'Table_5_2 Table 5.2}), it is very likely that global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} during the LGM was cooler than pre-industrial by 3°C to 8°C.

Some recent AOGCM simulations produce a stronger AMOC under LGM conditions, leading to mild cooling over the North Atlantic and GIS (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2007; {cite.5.'Weber_et_al_2007}). This finding contrasts with proxy-based information (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; {cite.5.'Hesse_et_al_2011}). Changes in deep-ocean temperature and salinity during the LGM have been constrained by pore-water chemistry in deep-sea sediments. For example, pore-water data indicate that deep water in the Atlantic Ocean cooled by between –1.7°C ± 0.9°C and –4.5°C ± 0.2°C, and became saltier by up to 2.4 ± 0.2 psu in the South Atlantic and at least 0.95 ± 0.07 psu in the North Atlantic (cf. {cite.5.'Adkins_et_al_2002}). The magnitude of deep-water cooling is supported by other marine proxy data (e.g., {cite.5.'Dwyer_et_al_2000}; {cite.5.'Martin_et_al_2002}; {cite.5.'Elderfield_et_al_2010}), while the increase in salinity is consistent with independent estimates based on d18O ({cite.5.'Duplessy_et_al_2002}; {cite.5.'Waelbroeck_et_al_2002}). Average salinity increased due to storage of freshwater in ice sheets. The much larger than average salinity increase in deep Southern Ocean compared to the North Atlantic is probably due to increased salt rejection through sea ice freezing processes around Antarctica ({cite.5.'Miller_et_al_2012b}) (see also Section 9.4.2.3.2 ).

As a result of prevailing LGM modelling {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({cite.5.'Chavaillaz_et_al_2013}; {cite.5.'Rojas_2013}) and ambiguities in proxy interpretations ({cite.5.'Kohfeld_et_al_2013}), it cannot be determined robustly whether LGM SH westerlies changed in amplitude and position relative to today.
