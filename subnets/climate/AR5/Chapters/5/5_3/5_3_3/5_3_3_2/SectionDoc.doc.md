title: 5.3.3.2 - Last Glacial Maximum Constraints on Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity

Temperature change recorded in proxies results from various {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} processes, and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} vary before equilibrium of the whole {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} is reached. Nevertheless, the equilibrium {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (ECS) can be estimated from past temperatures by explicitly counting the slow components of the processes (e.g., ice sheets) as forcings, rather than as feedbacks (PALAEOSENS Project Members, 2012). This is achieved in three fundamentally different ways ({cite.5.'Edwards_et_al_2007}); see also Sections {Chapters.9.9_7.9_7_3.9_7_3_2 9.7.3.2} and {Chapters.10.10_8.10_8_2.10_8_2_4 10.8.2.4}.

In the first approach, ECS is estimated by scaling the reconstructed global mean temperature change in the past with the RF difference of the past and 2 × {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} ({cite.5.'Hansen_et_al_2008}; Köhler et al., 2010) ({'Table_5_3 Table 5.3}). The results are subject to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the estimate of global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} based on {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records of incomplete spatial coverage (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3.5_3_3_1 Section 5.3.3.1}). Additional uncertainty is introduced when the sensitivity to {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} forcing is scaled to the sensitivity to 2 × CO2 forcing, as some but not all ({cite.5.'Brady_et_al_2013}) models show that these sensitivities differ due to the difference in cloud feedbacks ({cite.5.'Crucifix_2006}; {cite.5.'Hargreaves_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Yoshimori_et_al_2011}) ({'Figure_5_5 Figure 5.5}a, b).

In the second approach, an {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of LGM simulations is carried out using a single {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} in which each ensemble member differs in model parameters and the ensemble covers a range of ECS ({cite.5.'Annan_et_al_2005}; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2006; {cite.5.'Holden_et_al_2010a}; {cite.5.'Schmittner_et_al_2011}) ({'Table_5_3 Table 5.3}). Model parameters are then constrained by comparison with LGM temperature proxy information, generating a probability distribution of ECS. Although EMICSs are often used in order to attain sufficiently large ensemble size, the uncertainty arising from asymmetric cloud feedbacks cannot be addressed because they are parameterized in the {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs}.

In the third approach, multiple {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations are compared to proxy data, and performance of the models and indirectly their ECSs are assessed (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Braconnot_et_al_2012b}). Because the cross-model correlation between simulated LGM global cooling and ECS is poor ({'Figure_5_5 Figure 5.5}a), ECS cannot be constrained by the LGM global mean cooling. Models that show weaker sensitivity to LGM forcing than 4 × CO2 forcing in {'Figure_5_5 Figure 5.5}a tend to show weaker shortwave {Glossary.*Cloud_feedback cloud feedback} and hence weaker total feedback under LGM forcing than 4 × CO2 forcing ({'Figure_5_5 Figure 5.5}b), consistent with previous studies ({cite.5.'Crucifix_2006}). The relation found between simulated LGM tropical cooling and ECS across multi-GCM ({cite.5.'Hargreaves_et_al_2012}; {'Figure_5_5 Figure 5.5}c) has been used to constrain the ECS with the reconstructed LGM tropical cooling ({'Table_5_3 Table 5.3}). Again, the main caveats of this approach are the uncertainties in proxy reconstructions and missing dust and vegetation effects which may lead to underestimated LGM cooling in the simulations.

Based on these different approaches, estimates of ECS yield low probability for values outside the range 1°C to 5°C ({'Table_5_3 Table 5.3}). Even though there is some uncertainty in these studies owing to problems in both the {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} data and paleoclimate modelling as discussed in this section, it is very likely that ECS is greater than 1°C, and very unlikely that ECS exceeds 6°C.
