title: 5.2.2.1 - Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide from Ice Cores

Complementing instrumental data, air enclosed in polar ice provides a direct record of past atmospheric well-mixed {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} ({Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG}) concentrations albeit smoothed by firn diffusion ({cite.5.'Joos_and_Spahni_2008}; Köhler et al., 2011). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the temporal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records has been enhanced (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; {cite.5.'Ahn_and_Brook_2008}; {cite.5.'Loulergue_et_al_2008}; Lüthi et al., 2008; {cite.5.'Mischler_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Schilt_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Ahn_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Bereiter_et_al_2012}). During the pre-industrial part of the last 7000 years, millennial (20 ppm {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, 125 ppb {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}) and centennial variations (up to 10 ppm CO2, 40 ppb CH4 and 10 ppb {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}) are recorded (see {Chapters.6.6_2.6_2_2 Section 6.2.2} and {'Figure_6_6 Figure 6.6}). Significant centennial variations in CH4 during the last glacial occur in phase with Northern Hemisphere (NH) rapid climate changes, while millennial CO2 changes coincide with their Southern Hemisphere (SH) bipolar seesaw counterpart ({cite.5.'Ahn_and_Brook_2008}; {cite.5.'Loulergue_et_al_2008}; Lüthi et al., 2008; {cite.5.'Grachev_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Capron_et_al_2010b}; {cite.5.'Schilt_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Bereiter_et_al_2012}).

Long-term records have been extended from 650 ka in AR4 to 800 ka (Figures {'Figure_5_2 5.2} and {'Figure_5_3 5.3}) ({cite.5.'Loulergue_et_al_2008}; Lüthi et al., 2008; {cite.5.'Schilt_et_al_2010}). During the last 800 ka, the pre-industrial ice core {Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG} concentrations stay within well-defined natural limits with maximum interglacial concentrations of approximately 300 ppm, 800 ppb and 300 ppb for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively, and minimum glacial concentrations of approximately 180 ppm, 350 ppb, and 200 ppb. The new data show lower than pre-industrial (280 ppm) CO2 concentrations during interglacial periods from 800 to 430 ka (MIS19 to MIS13) ({'Figure_5_3 Figure 5.3}). It is a fact that present-day (2011) concentrations of CO2 (390.5 ppm), CH4 (1803 ppb) and N2O (324 ppm) (Annex II) exceed the range of concentrations recorded in the ice core records during the past 800 ka. With very high confidence, the rate of change of the observed {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} WMGHG rise and its {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} is unprecedented with respect to the highest resolution ice core record back to 22 ka for CO2, CH4 and N2O, accounting for the smoothing due to ice core enclosure processes ({cite.5.'Joos_and_Spahni_2008}; {cite.5.'Schilt_et_al_2010}). There is medium confidence that the rate of change of the observed anthropogenic WMGHG rise is also unprecedented with respect to the lower resolution records of the past 800 ka.

Progress in understanding the causes of past WMGHG variations is reported in {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2}.
