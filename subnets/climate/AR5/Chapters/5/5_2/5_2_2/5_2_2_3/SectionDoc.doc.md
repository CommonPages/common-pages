title: 5.2.2.3 - Past Changes in Mineral Dust Aerosol Concentrations

Past changes in mineral dust {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} (MDA) are important for estimates of {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_3 Section 5.3.3}) and for its supply of nutrients, especially iron to the Southern Ocean (see {Chapters.6.6_2 Section 6.2}). MDA concentration is controlled by variations in dust sources, and by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns acting on its transport and {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime}.

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, new records of past MDA flux have been obtained from deep-sea sediment and ice cores. A 4 million-year MDA-flux {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} from the Southern Ocean ({'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}) implies reduced dust generation and transport during the {Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} compared to {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} levels, followed by a significant rise around 2.7 Ma when NH ice volume increased (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011). Central Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records show that local MDA deposition fluxes are ~20 times higher during glacial compared to interglacial periods ({cite.5.'Fischer_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Lambert_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Petit_and_Delmonte_2009}). This is due to enhanced dust production in southern South America and perhaps Australia ({cite.5.'Gaiero_2007}; De Deckker et al., 2010; {cite.5.'Gabrielli_et_al_2010}; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011; {cite.5.'Wegner_et_al_2012}). The impact of changes in MDA lifetime ({cite.5.'Petit_and_Delmonte_2009}) on dust fluxes in Antarctica remains uncertain ({cite.5.'Fischer_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Wolff_et_al_2010}). Equatorial Pacific glacial–interglacial MDA fluxes co-vary with Antarctic records, but with a glacial–interglacial ratio in the range of approximately three to four ({cite.5.'Winckler_et_al_2008}), {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to enhanced dust production from Asian and northern South American sources in glacial times ({cite.5.'Maher_et_al_2010}). The dominant dust {Glossary.*Source source} regions (e.g., North Africa, Arabia and Central Asia) show complex patterns of variability ({cite.5.'Roberts_et_al_2011}). A glacial increase of MDA source strength by a factor of 3 to 4 requires low vegetation cover, seasonal aridity, and high wind speeds ({cite.5.'Fischer_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'McGee_et_al_2010}). In Greenland ice cores, MDA ice concentrations are higher by a factor of 100 and deposition fluxes by a factor 20 during glacial periods ({cite.5.'Ruth_et_al_2007}). This is due mainly to changes in the dust sources for Greenland (Asian desert areas), increased gustiness ({cite.5.'McGee_et_al_2010}) and {Glossary.*Atmospheric_lifetime atmospheric lifetime} and transport of MDA ({cite.5.'Fischer_et_al_2007}). A strong coherence is observed between dust in Greenland ice cores and aeolian deposition in European loess formations ({cite.5.'Antoine_et_al_2009}).

Global data synthesis shows two to four times more dust deposition at the Last Glacial Maximum ({Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) than today ({cite.5.'Derbyshire_2003}; {cite.5.'Maher_et_al_2010}). Based on data–model comparisons, estimates of global mean LGM dust {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} vary from –3 W m–2 to +0.1 W m–2, due to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in radiative properties. The best estimate value remains at –1 W m–2 as in AR4 ({cite.5.'Claquin_et_al_2003}; {cite.5.'Mahowald_et_al_2006}, 2011; {cite.5.'Patadia_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Takemura_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Yue_et_al_2010}). Models may underestimate the MDA RF at high latitudes ({cite.5.'Lambert_et_al_2013}).
