title: 5.2.2.2 - Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations from Geological Proxy Data

Geological proxies provide indirect information on atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentrations for time intervals older than those covered by {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_1 Section 5.2.2.1}). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the four primary {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} CO2 methods have undergone further development (Table 5.A.2). A reassessment of biological {Glossary.*Respiration respiration} and carbonate formation has reduced CO2 reconstructions based on fossil soils by approximately 50% ({cite.5.'Breecker_et_al_2010}). Bayesian statistical techniques for calibrating leaf stomatal density reconstructions produce consistently higher CO2 estimates than previously assessed ({cite.5.'Beerling_et_al_2009}), resulting in more convergence between estimates from these two terrestrial proxies. Recent CO2 reconstructions using the boron isotope proxy provide an improved understanding of foraminifer species effects and evolution of seawater {Glossary.*Alkalinity alkalinity} (Hönisch and Hemming, 2005) and seawater boron isotopic composition ({cite.5.'Foster_et_al_2012}). Quantification of the phytoplankton cell-size effects on carbon isotope fractionation has also improved the consistency of the alkenone method ({cite.5.'Henderiks_and_Pagani_2007}). These proxies have also been applied more widely and at higher temporal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} to a range of geological archives, resulting in an increased number of atmospheric CO2 estimates since 65 Ma ({cite.5.'Beerling_and_Royer_2011}). Although there is improved consensus between the proxy CO2 estimates, especially the marine proxy estimates, a significant degree of variation among the different techniques remains. All four techniques have been included in the assessment, as there is insufficient knowledge to discriminate between different proxy estimates on the basis of confidence (assessed in Table 5.A.2).

In the time interval between 65 and 23 Ma, all proxy estimates of CO2 concentration span a range of 300 ppm to 1500 ppm ({'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}). An independent constraint on Early Eocene atmospheric CO2 concentrationis provided by the occurrence of the sodium carbonate mineral nahcolite, in about 50 Ma lake sediments, which precipitates in association with halite at the sediment–water interface only at CO2 levels >1125 ppm ({cite.5.'Lowenstein_and_Demicco_2006}), and thus provides a potential lower bound for atmospheric concentration (medium confidence) during the warmest period of the last 65 Ma, the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO; 52 to 50 Ma; {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}), which is inconsistent with lower estimates from stomata and paleosoils. Although the reconstructions indicate a general decrease in CO2 concentrations since about 50 Ma ({'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}), the large scatter of proxy data precludes a robust assessment of the second-order variation around this overall {Glossary.*Trend trend}.

Since 23 Ma, CO2 proxy estimates are at pre-industrial levels with exception of the Middle Miocene climatic optimum (17 to 15 Ma) and the {Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} (5.3 to 2.6 Ma), which have higher concentrations. Although new CO2 reconstructions for the Pliocene based on marine proxies have produced consistent estimates mostly in the range 350 ppm to 450 ppm ({cite.5.'Pagani_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Seki_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Bartoli_et_al_2011}), the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} associated with these marine estimates remain difficult to quantify. Several boron-derived data sets agree within error (±25 ppm) with the ice core records ({cite.5.'Foster_2008}; Hönisch et al., 2009), but alkenone data for the ice core period are outside the error limits ({'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}). We conclude that there is medium confidence that CO2 levels were above pre-industrial interglacial concentration (~280 ppm) and did not exceed ~450 ppm during the Pliocene, with interglacial values in the upper part of that range between 350 and 450 ppm.
