title: 5.2.1.2 - Solar Forcing

Solar irradiance models (e.g., {cite.5.'Wenzler_et_al_2005}) have been improved to explain better the instrumental measurements of total solar irradiance ({Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI}) and spectral (wavelength dependent) solar irradiance (SSI). Typical changes measured over an 11-year {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} are 0.1% for TSI and up to several percent for the ultraviolet (UV) part of SSI (see {Chapters.8.8_4 Section 8.4}). Changes in TSI directly impact the Earth’s surface (see solar {Box_10_2 Box 10.2}), whereas changes in UV primarily affect the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}, but can influence the tropospheric circulation through dynamical coupling ({cite.5.'Haigh_1996}). Most models attribute all TSI and SSI changes exclusively to magnetic phenomena at the solar surface ({Glossary.*Sunspots sunspots}, faculae, magnetic network), neglecting any potential internal phenomena such as changes in energy transport (see also {Chapters.8.8_4 Section 8.4}). The basic concept in solar models is to divide the solar surface into different magnetic features each with a specific radiative flux. The balance of contrasting dark sunspots and bright faculae and magnetic network leads to a higher TSI value during solar cycle maxima and at most wavelengths, but some wavelengths may be out of phase with the solar cycle ({cite.5.'Harder_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Cahalan_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Haigh_et_al_2010}). TSI and SSI are calculated by adding the radiative fluxes of all features plus the contribution from the magnetically inactive surface. These models can successfully reproduce the measured TSI changes between 1978 and 2003 ({cite.5.'Balmaceda_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Crouch_et_al_2008}), but not necessarily the last minimum of 2008 ({cite.5.'Krivova_et_al_2011}). This approach requires detailed information of all the magnetic features and their temporal changes ({cite.5.'Wenzler_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Krivova_and_Solanki_2008}) (see {Chapters.8.8_4 Section 8.4}).

The extension of TSI and SSI into the pre-satellite period poses two main challenges. First, the satellite period (since 1978) used to calibrate the solar irradiance models does not show any significant longterm {Glossary.*Trend trend}. Second, information about the various magnetic features at the solar surface decreases back in time and must be deduced from proxies such as sunspot counts for the last 400 years and cosmogenic radionuclides (10Be and {Glossary.*14C 14C}) for the past millennium ({cite.5.'Muscheler_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Delaygue_and_Bard_2011}) and the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} ({'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) ({cite.5.'Steinhilber_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Vieira_et_al_2011}). 10Be and 14C records reflect not only {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity}, but also the geomagnetic field intensity and effects of their respective geochemical cycles and transport pathways ({cite.5.'Pedro_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Steinhilber_et_al_2012}). The corrections for these non-solar components, which are difficult to quantify, contribute to the overall error of the reconstructions (grey band in {'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}c).

TSI reconstructions are characterized by distinct grand solar minima lasting 50 to 100 years (e.g., the Maunder Minimum, 1645–1715) that are superimposed upon long-term changes. Spectral analysis of TSI records reveals periodicities of 87, 104, 150, 208, 350, 510, ~980 and ~2200 years ({'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}d) ({cite.5.'Stuiver_and_Braziunas_1993}), but with time-varying amplitudes ({cite.5.'Steinhilber_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Vieira_et_al_2011}). All reconstructions rely ultimately on the same data (sunspots and cosmogenic radionuclides), but differ in the details of the methodologies. As a result the reconstructions agree rather well in their shape, but differ in their amplitude ({'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}b) ({cite.5.'Wang_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Krivova_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Lean_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Schrijver_et_al_2011}) (see {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1 Section 8.4.1}).

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, most recent reconstructions show a considerably smaller difference (<0.1%) in TSI between the late 20th century and the Late Maunder Minimum (1675–1715) when the sun was very quiet, compared to the often used {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} of {cite.5.'Lean_et_al_1995b Lean et al. (1995b)} (0.24%) and {cite.5.'Shapiro_et_al_2011 Shapiro et al. (2011)} (~0.4%). The {cite.5.'Lean_et_al_1995a Lean et al. (1995a)} reconstruction has been used to scale solar {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} in simulations of the last millennium prior to PMIP3/CMIP5 (Table 5.A.1). PMIP3/CMIP5 last millennium simulations have used the weak solar forcing of recent reconstructions of TSI ({cite.5.'Schmidt_et_al_2011}, 2012b) calibrated ({cite.5.'Muscheler_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Delaygue_and_Bard_2011}) or spliced ({cite.5.'Steinhilber_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Vieira_and_Solanki_2010}) to {cite.5.'Wang_et_al_2005 Wang et al. (2005)}. The larger range of past TSI variability in {cite.5.'Shapiro_et_al_2011 Shapiro et al. (2011)} is not supported by studies of magnetic field indicators that suggest smaller changes over the 19th and 20th centuries ({cite.5.'Svalgaard_and_Cliver_2010}; {cite.5.'Lockwood_and_Owens_2011}).

Note that: (1) the recent new measurement of the absolute value of TSI and TSI changes during the past decades are assessed in {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_1 Section 8.4.1.1}; (2) the current state of understanding the effects of galactic cosmic rays on clouds is assessed in Sections {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_6 7.4.6} and {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_5 8.4.1.5} and (3) the use of solar forcing in simulations of the last millennium is discussed in {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5 Section 5.3.5}.
