title: 5.2.1.1 - Orbital Forcing

The term ‘orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing}’ is used to denote the incoming {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} changes originating from variations in the Earth’s orbital parameters as well as changes in its axial tilt. Orbital forcing is well known from precise astronomical calculations for the past and future ({cite.5.'Laskar_et_al_2004}). Changes in eccentricity, longitude of perihelion (related to precession) and axial tilt (obliquity) ({cite.5.'Berger_and_Loutre_1991}) predominantly affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution and magnitude of solar energy received at the top of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ({cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, {Box_6_1 Box 6.1}; {cite.5.'Jansen_et_al_2007}), and the durations and intensities of local seasons. Obliquity also modulates the annual mean {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} at any given latitude, with opposite effects at high and low latitudes. Orbital forcing is considered the pacemaker of transitions between glacials and {Glossary.*Interglacials_or_interglaciations interglacials} (high confidence), although there is still no consensus on exactly how the different physical processes influenced by insolation changes interact to influence {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} volume ({Box_5_2 Box 5.2}; {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_2 Section 5.3.2}). The different orbital configurations make each glacial and interglacial period unique ({cite.5.'Yin_and_Berger_2010}; {cite.5.'Tzedakis_et_al_2012a}). Multi-millennial trends of temperature, Arctic {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} and glaciers during the current interglacial period, and specifically the last 2000 years, have been related to orbital forcing ({Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5}).
