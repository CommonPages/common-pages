title: 5.2.1.3 - Volcanic Forcing

Volcanic activity affects global climate through the radiative impacts of atmospheric sulphate aerosols injected by volcanic eruptions (see Sections {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_2 8.4.2} and {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1 10.3.1}). Quantifying volcanic forcing in the pre-satellite period is important for historical and last millennium climate simulations, {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} estimates and {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution detection} and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution studies}. Reconstructions of past volcanic forcing are based on sulphate deposition from multiple ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, combined with atmospheric modelling of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} distribution and optical depth.

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, two new reconstructions of the spatial distribution of volcanic aerosol optical depth have been generated using polar ice cores, spanning the last 1500 years ({cite.5.'Gao_et_al_2008}, 2012) and 1200 years ({cite.5.'Crowley_and_Unterman_2013}) ({'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}a). Although the relative size of eruptions for the past 700 years is generally consistent among these and earlier studies ({cite.5.'Jansen_et_al_2007}), they differ in the absolute amplitude of peaks. There are also differences in the reconstructions of Icelandic eruptions, with an ongoing debate on the magnitude of stratospheric inputs for the 1783 Laki eruption ({cite.5.'Thordarson_and_Self_2003}; {cite.5.'Wei_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Lanciki_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Schmidt_et_al_2012a}). The recurrence time of past large volcanic aerosol injections (eruptions changing the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF) by more than 1 W mâ€“2) varies from 3 to 121 years, with long-term mean value of 35 years ({cite.5.'Gao_et_al_2012}) and 39 years ({cite.5.'Crowley_and_Unterman_2013}), and only two or three periods of 100 years without such eruptions since 850.

{cite.5.'Hegerl_et_al_2006 Hegerl et al. (2006)} estimated the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of the RF for a given volcanic event to be approximately 50%. Differences between reconstructions ({'Figure_5_1 Figure 5.1}a) arise from different {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} data, identification of the type of injection, methodologies to estimate particle distribution and optical depth ({cite.5.'Kravitz_and_Robock_2011}), and {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} of scavenging for large events ({cite.5.'Timmreck_et_al_2009}). Key limitations are associated with {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} chronologies ({cite.5.'Plummer_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Sigl_et_al_2013}), and deposition patterns ({cite.5.'Moore_et_al_2012}).

A new independent methodology has recently been developed to distinguish between tropospheric and stratospheric volcanic aerosol deposits ({cite.5.'Baroni_et_al_2007}). The stratospheric character of several large eruptions has started to be assessed from Greenland and/or

Antarctic ice core sulphur isotope data ({cite.5.'Baroni_et_al_2008}; Cole-Dai et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Schmidt_et_al_2012b}).

The use of different volcanic forcing reconstructions in pre-PMIP3/ CMIP5 (see AR4 {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}) and PMIP3/CMIP5 last millennium simulations ({cite.5.'Schmidt_et_al_2011}) (Table 5.A.1), together with the methods used to implement these volcanic indices with different representations of aerosols in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, is a {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in model intercomparisons. The impact of volcanic forcing on climate variations of the last millennium climate is assessed in Sections {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_5 5.3.5}, {Chapters.5.5_4 5.4}, {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1 5.5.1} and {Chapters.10.10_7.10_7_1 10.7.1}.
