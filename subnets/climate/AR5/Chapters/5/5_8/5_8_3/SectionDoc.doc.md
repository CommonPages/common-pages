title: 5.8.3 - Next Glacial Inception

Since orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} can be accurately calculated for the future (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1 Section 5.2.1}), efforts can be made to predict the onset of the next glacial period. However, the glaciation threshold depends not only on {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} but also on the atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration ({cite.5.'Archer_and_Ganopolski_2005}). Models of different complexity have been used to investigate the response to orbital forcing in the future for a range of atmospheric CO2 levels. These results consistently show that a glacial inception is not expected to happen within the next approximate 50 kyr if either atmospheric CO2 concentration remains above 300 ppm or cumulative carbon {Topics.*Emissions emissions} exceed 1000 PgC ({cite.5.'Loutre_and_Berger_2000}; {cite.5.'Archer_and_Ganopolski_2005}; {cite.5.'Cochelin_et_al_2006}). Only if atmospheric CO2 content was below the pre-industrial level would a glaciation be possible under present orbital configuration ({cite.5.'Loutre_and_Berger_2000}; {cite.5.'Cochelin_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Kutzbach_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Vettoretti_and_Peltier_2011}; {cite.5.'Tzedakis_et_al_2012a}). Simulations with climateâ€“{Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} models show multi-millennial {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} CO2 in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} (see {Box_6_1 Box 6.1}). Even for the lowest RCP 2.6 scenario, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will exceed 300 ppm until the year 3000. It is therefore virtually certain that orbital forcing will not trigger a glacial inception before the end of the next millennium.
