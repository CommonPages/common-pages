title: 5.8.2 - Ocean Circulation

Numerous modelling studies demonstrate that increased freshwater flux into the North Atlantic leads to weakening of the AMOC. Results of {Glossary.*Earth_System_Model_of_Intermediate_Complexity EMICs} ({cite.5.'Rahmstorf_et_al_2005}) and coupled {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} also suggest that AMOC may have multiple equilibrium states under present or glacial climate conditions ({cite.5.'Hawkins_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Hu_et_al_2012}). Experiments with {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} provide evidence that the sensitivity of the AMOC to freshwater perturbation is larger for glacial boundary conditions than for interglacial conditions ({cite.5.'Swingedouw_et_al_2009}) and that the recovery time scale of the AMOC is longer for {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} conditions than for the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} ({cite.5.'Bitz_et_al_2007}).

The abrupt climate-change event at 8.2 ka permits the study of the recovery time of the AMOC to freshwater perturbation under near-modern boundary conditions (Rohling and Pälike, 2005). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, new {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records and simulations confirm that the pattern of surface-ocean and atmospheric climate anomalies is consistent with a reduction in the strength of the AMOC ({'Figure_5_18 Figure 5.18}a, b, d). Available proxy records from the North Atlantic support the hypothesis that freshwater input into the North Atlantic reduced the amount of deep and central water-mass formation, Nordic Seas overflows, intermediate water temperatures and the {Glossary.*Ventilation ventilation} state of North Atlantic Deep Water ({'Figure_5_18 Figure 5.18}c, d) ({cite.5.'McManus_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Ellison_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Kleiven_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Bamberg_et_al_2010}). A concomitant decrease of {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} and atmospheric temperatures in the North Atlantic and in Greenland has been observed ({'Figure_5_18 Figure 5.18}a, b) with the climate anomaly associated with the event lasting 100–160 years ({cite.5.'Daley_et_al_2011}). The additional freshwater that entered the North Atlantic during the 8.2 ka event is estimated between 1.6·1014 m3 and 8·1014 m3 (von Grafenstein et al., 1998; {cite.5.'Barber_et_al_1999}; {cite.5.'Clarke_et_al_2004}). The duration of the meltwater release may have been as short as 0.5 years ({cite.5.'Clarke_et_al_2004}), but new drainage estimates indicate an up to 200 year-duration in two separate stages ({cite.5.'Gregoire_et_al_2012}). A four-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} with a one-year freshwater perturbation of 2.5 Sv only gives temperature anomalies half of what has been reconstructed and with a shorter duration than observed, resulting from unresolved processes in models, imprecise representation of the initial climate state or a too short duration of the freshwater {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.5.'Morrill_et_al_2013a}). These marine-based reconstructions consistently show that the recovery time scale of the shallow and deep overturning circulation is on the order of 200 years ({cite.5.'Ellison_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Bamberg_et_al_2010}) ({'Figure_5_18 Figure 5.18}c, d), with one record pointing to a partial recovery on a decadal time scale ({cite.5.'Kleiven_et_al_2008}). Both recovery time scale and sensitivity of the AMOC to the freshwater perturbation are generally consistent with model experiments for the 8.2 ka event using coarse-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} models, {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} and eddy permitting models ({cite.5.'LeGrande_and_Schmidt_2008}; {cite.5.'Spence_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Li_et_al_2009}). The recovery of temperatures out of the cold anomaly appears overprinted with natural variability in the proxy data, and is more gradual in data than in the {Glossary.*Atmosphere_Ocean_General_Circulation_Model AOGCM} experiments ({'Figure_5_18 Figure 5.18}c, d). In summary, {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change multiple lines of evidence} indicate, with high confidence, that the interglacial mode of the AMOC can recover from a short-term freshwater input into the subpolar North Atlantic.

The characteristic {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} patterns associated with a colder North Atlantic Ocean as described in {Chapters.5.5_7 Section 5.7} are evident for the 8.2 ka event in both models and proxy data ({'Figure_5_18 Figure 5.18}e, f).
