title: 5.8.1 - Ice Sheets

Modelling studies suggest the existence of multiple equilibrium states for ice sheets with respect to temperature, {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration and orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} phase spaces ({cite.5.'DeConto_and_Pollard_2003}; {cite.5.'Calov_and_Ganopolski_2005}; {cite.5.'Ridley_et_al_2010}). This implies a possibility of irreversible changes in the climate-{Topics.*Climate_System cryosphere} system in the past and future.

The existence of threshold behaviour in the EAIS is consistent with an abrupt increase in Antarctic ice volume at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, 33 Ma, {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to gradual atmospheric CO2 concentration decline on geological time scale ({cite.5.'Pagani_et_al_2005b}; {cite.5.'Pearson_et_al_2009}) ({'Figure_5_2 Figure 5.2}, {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2 Section 5.2.2}). {Glossary.*Ice_sheet Ice sheet} models produce a hysteresis behaviour of the EAIS with respect to CO2 concentrations, leading to EAIS glaciation when CO2 concentration declined to 600â€“ 900 ppm ({cite.5.'DeConto_and_Pollard_2003}; {cite.5.'Langebroek_et_al_2009}) and {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} for CO2 above 1200 ppm ({cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}). {Glossary.*Proxy Proxy} records suggest that the WAIS might have collapsed during last {Glossary.*Interglacials_or_interglaciations interglacials} ({cite.5.'Naish_et_al_2009b}; {cite.5.'Vaughan_et_al_2011}) and was absent during warm periods of the {Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} when CO2 concentration was 350 to 450 ppm (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_2 Section 5.2.2.2}) and global {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} was higher than present (see {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 Section 5.6.1}). These reconstructions and one ice sheet model simulation ({cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}) suggest that WAIS is very sensitive to the subsurface ocean temperature. This implies, with medium confidence, that a large part of the WAIS will be eventually lost if the atmospheric CO2 concentration stays within, or above, the range of 350 to 450 ppm for several millennia.

Observational evidence suggest that the GIS was also much smaller than today during the MPWP (see Sections {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 5.6.1} and {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2 5.2.2}), consistent with the results of simulations with ice sheet models ({cite.5.'Dolan_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Koenig_et_al_2011}). Ice sheet model simulations and proxy records show that the volume of the GIS was also reduced during the past interglacial period ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_2 Section 5.6.2}). This supports modelling results that indicate temperature or CO2 thresholds for melting and re-growth of the GIS may lie in close proximity to the present and future levels ({cite.5.'Gregory_and_Huybrechts_2006}; {cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2008}) ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 Section 5.6.1}) and that the GIS may have multiple equilibrium states under present-day climate state ({cite.5.'Ridley_et_al_2010}).

Therefore, proxy records and results of model simulations indicate with medium confidence that the GIS and WAIS could be destabilized by {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} climate changes, although the time scales of the ice sheets response to climate change are very long (several centuries to millennia).
