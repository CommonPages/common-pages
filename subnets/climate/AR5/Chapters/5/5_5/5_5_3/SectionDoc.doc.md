Due to the {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} of glacier fronts, glacier length variations resolve only decadalto centennial-scale {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} new and improved chronologies of glacier size variations were published ({cite.5.'Anderson_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Joerin_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Yang_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Jomelli_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Licciardi_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Menounos_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Schaefer_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Wiles_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Hughes_et_al_2012}). Studies of sediments from glacier-fed lakes and marine deposits have allowed new continuous reconstructions of glacier fluctuations ({cite.5.'Matthews_and_Dresser_2008}; {cite.5.'Russell_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Briner_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Bowerman_and_Clark_2011}; {cite.5.'Larsen_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Bertrand_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Vasskog_et_al_2012}). Reconstructions of the history of ice shelves and ice sheets/caps have also emerged ({cite.5.'Antoniades_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Hodgson_2011}; {cite.5.'Simms_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Smith_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Kirshner_et_al_2012}). New data confirm a general increase of glacier extent in the NH and decrease in the SH during the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} ({cite.5.'Davis_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Menounos_et_al_2009}), consistent with the local trends in summer {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} and temperatures. Some exceptions exist (e.g., in the eastern Himalayas), where glaciers were most extensive in the early Holocene ({cite.5.'Gayer_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Seong_et_al_2009}), potentially due to {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} changes ({cite.5.'Rupper_et_al_2009}). Due to dating {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, incompleteness and heterogeneity of most existing glacial chronologies, it is difficult to compare glacier variations between regions at centennial and shorter time scales ({cite.5.'Heyman_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Kirkbride_and_Winkler_2012}). There are no definitive conclusions regarding potential inter-hemispheric synchronicity of sub-millennial scale glacier fluctuations ({cite.5.'Wanner_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Jomelli_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Licciardi_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Schaefer_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Winkler_and_Matthews_2010}; {cite.5.'Wanner_et_al_2011}).

Glacial chronologies for the last 2 kyr are better constrained ({cite.5.'Yang_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Clague_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Wiles_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Johnson_and_Smith_2012}). Multi-centennial glacier variability has been linked with variations in {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity} ({cite.5.'Holzhauser_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Wiles_et_al_2008}), volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.5.'Anderson_et_al_2008}) and changes in North Atlantic circulation ({cite.5.'Linderholm_and_Jansson_2007}; {cite.5.'Nesje_2009}; {cite.5.'Marzeion_and_Nesje_2012}). {Glossary.*Glacier Glacier} response is more heterogeneous and complex during the {Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA} than the uniform global glacier recession observed at present (see {Chapters.4.4_3 Section 4.3}). Glaciers were smaller during the MCA than in the early 21st Century in the western Antarctic Peninsula ({cite.5.'Hall_et_al_2010}) and Southern Greenland ({cite.5.'Larsen_et_al_2011}). However, prominent advances occurred within the MCA in the Alps ({cite.5.'Holzhauser_et_al_2005}), Patagonia ({cite.5.'Luckman_and_Villalba_2001}), New Zealand ({cite.5.'Schaefer_et_al_2009}), East Greenland ({cite.5.'Lowell_et_al_2013}) and SE Tibet ({cite.5.'Yang_et_al_2008}). Glaciers in northwestern North America were similar in size during the MCA compared to the peak during the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA}, probably driven by increased winter precipitation ({cite.5.'Koch_and_Clague_2011}).

There is high confidence that glaciers at times have been smaller than at the end of the 20th century in the Alps ({cite.5.'Joerin_et_al_2008}; Ivy-Ochs et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Goehring_et_al_2011}), Scandinavia ({cite.5.'Nesje_et_al_2011}), Altai in Central Asia ({cite.5.'Agatova_et_al_2012}), Baffin Island ({cite.5.'Miller_et_al_2005}), Greenland ({cite.5.'Larsen_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Young_et_al_2011}), Spitsbergen ({cite.5.'Humlum_et_al_2005}), but the precise glacier extent in the previous warm periods of the Holocene is often difficult to assess. While early-to-mid-Holocene glacier minima can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} with high confidence to high summer insolation (see {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1.5_5_1_1 Section 5.5.1.1}), the current glacier retreat, however, occurs within a context of orbital forcing that would be favourable for NH glacier growth. If retreats continue at current rates, most extratropical NH glaciers will shrink to their minimum extent, that existed between 8 ka and 6 ka (medium confidence) (e.g., {cite.5.'Anderson_et_al_2008}); and ice shelves on the Antarctic peninsula will retreat to an extent unprecedented through Holocene ({cite.5.'Hodgson_2011}; {cite.5.'Mulvaney_et_al_2012}).
