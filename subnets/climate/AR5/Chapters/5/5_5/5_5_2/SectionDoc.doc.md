title: 5.5.2 - Sea Ice

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} several new {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} reconstructions for the Arctic and sub-Arctic have been made available that resolve multi-decadal to century-scale variability. Proxies of sea-ice extent have been further developed from biomarkers in deep sea sediments (e.g., IP25, {cite.5.'Belt_et_al_2007}; Müller et al., 2011) and from sea-ice biota preserved in sediments (e.g., Justwan and Koç, 2008). Indirect information on sea-ice conditions based on drift wood and beach erosion has also been compiled ({cite.5.'Funder_et_al_2011}). In general, these sea-ice reconstructions parallel regional {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}, yet they display spatial heterogeneity, and differences between the methods, making it difficult to provide quantitative estimates of past sea-ice extent. Summer sea-ice cover was reduced compared to late 20th century levels both in the Arctic Ocean and along East Greenland between 8 ka and 6.5 ka (e.g., {cite.5.'Moros_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Polyak_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Funder_et_al_2011}), a feature which is captured by some MH simulations ({cite.5.'Berger_et_al_2013}). The response of this sea ice cover to summer {Glossary.*Insolation insolation} warming was shown to be central for explaining the reconstructed warmer winter temperatures over the adjacent land ({cite.5.'Otto_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Zhang_et_al_2010}). During the last 6 kyr available records show a long-term {Glossary.*Trend trend} of a more extensive Arctic sea ice cover driven by the orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} (e.g., {cite.5.'Polyak_et_al_2010}), but punctuated by strong century-to-millennial scale variability. Consistent with Arctic temperature changes (see {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1 Section 5.5.1}), sea ice proxies indicate relatively reduced sea-ice cover from 800 to 1200 followed by a subsequent increase during the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA} ({cite.5.'Polyak_et_al_2010}). {Glossary.*Proxy Proxy} reconstructions document the 20th-century ice loss trend, which is also observed in historical sea ice data sets with a decline since the late 19th century ({cite.5.'Divine_and_Dick_2006}). There is medium confidence that the current ice loss was unprecedented and that current SSTs in the Arctic were anomalously high at least in the context of the last 1450 years ({cite.5.'England_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Kinnard_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Kaufman_et_al_2009}; Macias Fauria et al., 2010; {cite.5.'Polyakov_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Kinnard_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Spielhagen_et_al_2011}). Fewer high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} records exist from the Southern Ocean. Data from the Indian Ocean sector document an increasing sea-ice trend during the Holocene, with a rather abrupt increase between 5 ka and 4 ka, consistent with regional temperatures (see {Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_1.5_5_1_3 Section 5.5.1.3}) ({cite.5.'Denis_et_al_2010}).
