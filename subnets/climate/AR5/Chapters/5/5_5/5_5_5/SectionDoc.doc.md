title: 5.5.5 - Megadroughts and Floods

Multiple lines of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} evidence from {Glossary.*Tree_rings tree rings}, lake sediments, and speleothems indicate with high confidence that decadal or multi-decadal episodes of {Glossary.*Drought drought} have been a prominent feature of North American {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} {Glossary.*Hydroclimate hydroclimate} (e.g., {cite.5.'Axelson_et_al_2009}; St. George et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2010a}, 2010b; {cite.5.'Shuman_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Woodhouse_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Newby_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Oswald_and_Foster_2011}; {cite.5.'Routson_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Stahle_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Stambaugh_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Laird_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Ault_et_al_2013}). During the last millennium, western North America drought reconstructions based on tree ring information ({'Figure_5_13 Figure 5.13}) show longer and more severe droughts than today, particularly during the {Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA} in the southwestern and central United States ({cite.5.'Meko_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2010b}). The mid-14th century cooling coincides in southwestern North America with a shift towards overall wetter conditions ({cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2010a}). In the Pacific Northwest, contrasting results emerge from lake sediment records, indicating wetter conditions during the MCA ({cite.5.'Steinman_et_al_2013}), and treering data showing no substantial change ({cite.5.'Zhang_and_Hebda_2005}; {cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2010a}). In Scandinavia, new tree-ring based reconstructions show a multi-centennial summer drought phase during Medieval times (900–1350) ({cite.5.'Helama_et_al_2009}), while lake sediment proxies from the same {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} suggest wetter winters ({cite.5.'Luoto_et_al_2013}). New tree-ring reconstructions from the southern-central ({cite.5.'Wilson_et_al_2013}) and southeastern British Isles ({cite.5.'Cooper_et_al_2013}) do not reveal multi-centennial drought during medieval times, but rather alternating multidecades of dry and wet periods. {cite.5.'Wilson_et_al_2013 Wilson et al. (2013)} reconstructed drier conditions between ~1300 and the early 16th century. Büntgen et al. (2011b) identified exceptionally dry conditions in central Europe from 200 to 350 and between 400 and 600. Numerous tree-ring records from the eastern Mediterranean testify to the regular occurrence of droughts in the past few millennia (e.g., {cite.5.'Akkemik_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Nicault_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Luterbacher_et_al_2012}). In northern Africa, {cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2007b Esper et al. (2007b)} and Touchan et al. (2008; 2011) show severe drought events through the last millennium, particularly prior to 1300, in the 1400s, between 1700 and 1900, and in the most recent instrumental data. Using multiple proxies from Chile, {cite.5.'Boucher_et_al_2011 Boucher et al. (2011)} inferred wetter conditions during 1000–1250, followed by much drier period until 1400 and wetter conditions similar to present afterwards, while {cite.5.'Ledru_et_al_2013 Ledru et al. (2013)} reconstructed a dry MCA-{Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA} transition until 1550. For the South American Altiplano {cite.5.'Morales_et_al_2012 Morales et al. (2012)} found periods of drier conditions in the 14th, 16th, and 18th centuries, as well as a modern drying {Glossary.*Trend trend}.

{Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable Reconstruction} of past flooding from sedimentary, botanical and historical records (Brázdil et al., 2006; {cite.5.'Baker_2008}; Brázdil et al., 2012) provides a means to compare recent large, rare floods, and to analyse links between flooding and {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. During the last few millennia, flood records reveal strong decadal to secular variability and non-stationarity in flood frequency and clustering of paleofloods, which varied among regions. In Europe, modern flood magnitudes are not unusual within the context of the last 1000 years (e.g., Brázdil et al., 2012). In Central Europe, the Elbe and the Oder/Odra Rivers show a decrease in the frequency of winter floods during the last 80 to 150 years compared to earlier centuries, while summer floods indicate no significant trend ({cite.5.'Mudelsee_et_al_2003}) ({'Figure_5_14 Figure 5.14}f–i). In the Alps, paleoflood records derived from lake sediments have shown a higher flood frequency during cool and/or wet phases ({cite.5.'Stewart_et_al_2011}; Giguet-Covex et al., 2012; {cite.5.'Wilhelm_et_al_2012}), a feature also found in Central Europe ({cite.5.'Starkel_et_al_2006}) and the British Isles ({cite.5.'Macklin_et_al_2012}). In the western Mediterranean, winter floods were more frequent during relatively cool and wet climate conditions of the LIA ({cite.5.'Benito_et_al_2003b}; {cite.5.'Piccarreta_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Luterbacher_et_al_2012}; {'Figure_5_14 Figure 5.14}a), whereas autumn floods reflect multi-decadal variations ({cite.5.'Benito_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Machado_et_al_2011}; {'Figure_5_14 Figure 5.14}b, c). In China, extraordinary paleoflood events in the Yellow, Weihe and Qishuihe rivers, occurred synchronously with severe droughts and dust accumulations coinciding with a monsoonal shift, the most severe floods dated at 3.1 ka ({cite.5.'Zha_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Huang_et_al_2012}). In India, flood frequencies since 1950 are the largest for the last several hundred years for eight rivers, interpreted as a strengthening of the {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} conditions after the LIA ({cite.5.'Kale_2008}). In southwestern United States, increased frequency of high-magnitude paleofloods coincide with periods of cool, wet climate, whereas warm intervals including the MCA, corresponded with significant decreases in the number of large floods ({cite.5.'Ely_et_al_1993}). In the Great Plains of North America, the frequency of large floods increased significantly around 850 with magnitudes roughly two to three times larger than those of the 1972 flood ({cite.5.'Harden_et_al_2011}). South America large flooding in the Atacama and Peruvian desert streams originated in the highland Altiplano and were particularly intense during El Niño events ({cite.5.'Magilligan_et_al_2008}). In the winter rainfall zone of southern Africa, the frequency of large floods decreased during warmer conditions (e.g., from 1425 to 1600 and after 1925) and increased during wetter, colder conditions ({cite.5.'Benito_et_al_2011}).

In summary, there is high confidence that past floods larger than recorded since the 20th century have occurred during the past 500 years in northern and central Europe, western Mediterranean region, and eastern Asia. There is, however, medium confidence that in the Near East, India, central North America, modern large floods are comparable to or surpass historical floods in magnitude and/or frequency.
