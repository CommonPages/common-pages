title: 5.5.1.1 - Northern Hemisphere Mid to High Latitudes

New studies confirm the spatial patterns of SAT and {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} distribution as summarised in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.5.'Jansen_et_al_2007}). According to a recent compilation of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} data, the global mean annual temperatures around 8 to 6 ka were about 0.7°C higher, and extratropical NH temperatures were about 1°C higher than for pre-industrial conditions ({cite.5.'Marcott_et_al_2013}). Spatial variability in the temperature anomalies and the timing of the thermal maximum implicate atmospheric or oceanic dynamical feedbacks including effects from remaining ice sheets (e.g., {cite.5.'Wanner_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Leduc_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Bartlein_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Renssen_et_al_2012}). The peak early-to-mid-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} North Atlantic and sub-Arctic SST anomalies are reconstructed and simulated to primarily occur in summer and in the stratified uppermost surface-ocean layer ({cite.5.'Hald_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Andersson_et_al_2010}). Terrestrial MH (~6 ka, {'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) summer-season temperatures were higher than modern in the mid-to-high latitudes of the NH, consistent with minimum {Glossary.*Glacier glacier} extents ({Chapters.5.5_5.5_5_3 Section 5.5.3}) and PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5 simulated responses to orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({'Figure_5_11 Figure 5.11}) ({cite.5.'Braconnot_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Bartlein_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Izumi_et_al_2013}). There is also robust evidence for warmer MH winters compared to the late 20th century (e.g., {cite.5.'Wanner_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Sundqvist_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Bartlein_et_al_2011}) ({'Figure_5_11 Figure 5.11}), but the simulated high latitude winter warming is model dependent and is sensitive to ocean and sea-ice changes ({cite.5.'Otto_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Zhang_et_al_2010}). Overall, models underestimate the reduction in the latitudinal gradient of European winter temperatures during the MH ({cite.5.'Brewer_et_al_2007}). There is a general, gradual NH cooling after ~5 ka, linked to orbital forcing, and increased amplitude of millennial-scale variability ({cite.5.'Wanner_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Vinther_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Kobashi_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Marcott_et_al_2013}).

Since AR4, regional temperature reconstructions have been produced for the last 2 kyr ({'Figure_5_12 Figure 5.12}; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013). A recent multi-proxy 2000-year Arctic temperature {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} shows that temperatures during the first centuries were comparable or even higher than during the 20th century (Hanhijärvi et al., 2013; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013). During the {Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA}, portions of the Arctic and sub-Arctic experienced periods warmer than any subsequent period, except for the most recent 50 years ({'Figure_5_12 Figure 5.12}) ({cite.5.'Kaufman_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Kobashi_et_al_2010}, 2011; {cite.5.'Vinther_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Spielhagen_et_al_2011}). {cite.5.'Tingley_and_Huybers_2013 Tingley and Huybers (2013)} provided a statistical analysis of northern high-latitude temperature reconstructions back to 1400 and found that recent extreme hot summers are unprecedented over this time span. Marine proxy records indicate anomalously high SSTs north of Iceland and the Norwegian Sea from 900 to 1300, followed by a generally colder period that ended in the early 20th century. Modern SSTs in this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} may still be lower than the warmest intervals of the 900– 1300 period ({cite.5.'Cunningham_et_al_2013}). Further north, in Fram Strait, modern SSTs from Atlantic Water appear warmer than those reconstructed from foraminifera for any prior period of the last 2000 years

({cite.5.'Spielhagen_et_al_2011}). However, different results are obtained using dinocysts from the same sediment core ({cite.5.'Bonnet_et_al_2010 Bonnet et al. (2010)} showing a cooling {Glossary.*Trend trend} over the last 2000 years without a 20th century rise, and warmest intervals centered at years 100 and 600.

Tree-ring data and lake sediment information from the North American treeline ({cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Bird_et_al_2009}; D’Arrigo et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Anchukaitis_et_al_2012}) suggest common variability between different records during the last centuries. An annually resolved, tree-ring based 800-year temperature reconstruction over temperate North America (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013) and a 1500-year long pollen-based temperature estimate ({cite.5.'Viau_et_al_2012}) show cool periods 500–700 and 1200–1900 as well as a warm period between 750 and 1100. The generally colder conditions until 1900 are in broad agreement with other pollen, tree-ring and lake-sediment evidence from northwest Canada, the Canadian Rockies and Colorado ({cite.5.'Luckman_and_Wilson_2005}; {cite.5.'Salzer_and_Kipfmueller_2005}; {cite.5.'Loso_2009}; {cite.5.'MacDonald_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Thomas_and_Briner_2009}). It is very likely that the most recent decades have been, on average, the warmest across mid-latitude western and temperate North America over at least 500 years ({cite.5.'Wahl_and_Smerdon_2012}; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; {'Figure_5_12 Figure 5.12}).

New warm-season temperature reconstructions (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; {'Figure_5_12 Figure 5.12}) covering the past 2 millennia show that warm European summer conditions were prevalent during 1st century, followed by cooler conditions from the 4th to the 7th century. Persistent warm conditions also occurred during the 8th–11th centuries, peaking throughout Europe during the 10th century. Prominent periods with cold summers occurred in the mid-15th and early 19th centuries. There is high confidence that northern Fennoscandia from 900 to 1100 was as warm as the mid-to-late 20th century ({cite.5.'Helama_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Linderholm_et_al_2010}; Büntgen et al., 2011a; {cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2012a}; 2012b; {cite.5.'McCarroll_et_al_2013}; {cite.5.'Melvin_et_al_2013}). The evidence also suggests warm conditions during the 1st century, but comparison with recent temperatures is restricted because long-term temperature trends from tree-ring data are uncertain ({cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2012a}). In the European Alps region, tree-ring based summer temperature reconstructions (Büntgen et al., 2005; {cite.5.'Nicolussi_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Corona_et_al_2010}, 2011; Büntgen et al., 2011b) show higher temperatures in the last decades than during any time in the MCA, while reconstructions based on lake sediments (Larocque-Tobler et al., 2010; {cite.5.'Trachsel_et_al_2012}) show as high, or slightly higher temperatures during parts of the MCA compared to most recent decades. The longest summer temperature reconstructions from parts of the Alps show several intervals during Roman and earlier times as warm (or warmer) than most of the 20th century (Büntgen et al., 2011b; {cite.5.'Stewart_et_al_2011}).

Since AR4, new temperature reconstructions have also been generated for Asia. A tree-ring based summer temperature reconstruction for temperate East Asia back to 800 indicates warm conditions during the period 850–1050, followed by cooler conditions during 1350–1880 and a subsequent 20th century warming ({cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2012}; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; {'Figure_5_12 Figure 5.12}). Tree-ring reconstructions from the western Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, Tianshan Mountains and western High Asia depict warm conditions from the 10th to the 15th centuries, lower temperature afterwards and a 20th century warming ({cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2007a}; {cite.5.'Zhu_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Zhang_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Yadav_et_al_2011}).

Taking associated {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} into consideration, 20th century temperatures in those regions were likely not higher than during the first part of the last millennium. In different regions of China, temperatures appear higher during recent decades than during earlier centuries, although with large uncertainties (e.g., {cite.5.'Ge_et_al_2006}, 2010; {cite.5.'Wang_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Holmes_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Yang_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Zhang_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2012}). In northeast China, an alkenone-based reconstruction indicates that the growing season temperature during the periods 480–860, 1260–1300, 1510–1570 and 1800–1900 was about 1°C lower compared with the 20th century ({cite.5.'Chu_et_al_2011}). These reconstructed NH regional temperature evolutions appear consistent with last millennium {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations using a range of solar forcing estimates ({'Figure_5_12 Figure 5.12}).

There is high confidence that in the extratropical NH, both regionally and on a hemispheric basis, the surface warming of the 20th century reversed the long term cooling trend due to orbital forcing.
