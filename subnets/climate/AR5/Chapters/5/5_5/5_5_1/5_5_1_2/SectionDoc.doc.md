{cite.5.'Marcott_et_al_2013 Marcott et al. (2013)} provide a compilation of tropical {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} reconstructions, showing a gradual warming of about 0.5°C until 5 ka and little change thereafter. {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} tropical SST trends are regionally heterogeneous and variable in magnitude. Alkenone records from the eastern tropical Pacific, western tropical Atlantic, and the Indonesian archipelago document a warming {Glossary.*Trend trend} of ~0.5°C to 2°C from the early Holocene to present ({cite.5.'Leduc_et_al_2010}), consistent with local {Glossary.*Insolation insolation}. In contrast, regional trends of planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca records are heterogeneous, and imply smaller magnitude SST changes ({cite.5.'Leduc_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Schneider_et_al_2010}). Foraminiferal Mg/Ca records in the Indo-Pacific warm-pool {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} show cooling trends with varying magnitudes ({cite.5.'Stott_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Linsley_et_al_2010}). When comparing SST records from different {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} proxies it is important to note that they can have different, and also regionally varying, seasonal biases ({cite.5.'Schneider_et_al_2010}).

Terrestrial temperature {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} efforts have mostly focussed on Africa and to some extent on southeast Asia ({'Figure_5_11 Figure 5.11}), with a lack of syntheses from South America and Australia ({cite.5.'Bartlein_et_al_2011}). The PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5 MH simulations show summer cooling compared to pre-industrial conditions and a shorter growing season in the tropical {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} regions of Africa and southeast Asia ({'Figure_5_11 Figure 5.11}), {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to increased cloudiness and local evaporation ({cite.5.'Braconnot_et_al_2007}). In contrast, MH simulations and reconstructions for the entire tropics (30°S to 30°N) show generally higher mean temperature of the warmest month and lower mean temperature of the coldest month than for the mid-20th century.
