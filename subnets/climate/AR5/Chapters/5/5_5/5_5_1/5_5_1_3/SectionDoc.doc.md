title: 5.5.1.3 - Southern Hemisphere Mid to High Latitudes

In the high latitude Southern Ocean, {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} trends follow the decrease in austral summer duration, with a cooling {Glossary.*Trend trend} from the early Holocene into the late Holocene ({cite.5.'Kaiser_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Shevenell_et_al_2011}). Similar cooling trends are found in the Australian-New Zealand {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.5.'Bostock_et_al_2013}). Increased amplitude of millennial-to-centennial scale SST variability between 5 ka and 4 ka is recorded in several locations, possibly due to variations in the position and strength of the westerlies ({cite.5.'Moros_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Euler_and_Ninnemann_2010}; {cite.5.'Shevenell_et_al_2011}). The Holocene land-{Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} history in the SH is difficult to assess. Individual reconstructions generally track the trends registered by Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records with peak values at around 12 to 10 ka (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2011b; {cite.5.'Marcott_et_al_2013}; {cite.5.'Mathiot_et_al_2013}). Pollen-based records indicate positive MH temperature anomalies in southern South Africa that are not reproduced in the PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations ({'Figure_5_11 Figure 5.11}).

Indices for the position of Southern Ocean fronts and the strength and position of the westerlies diverge ({cite.5.'Moros_et_al_2009}; e.g., {cite.5.'Shevenell_et_al_2011}). For the mid-to-late-Holocene, {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} of different complexity consistently show a poleward shift and intensification of the SH westerlies in response to orbital {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.5.'Varma_et_al_2012}). However, the magnitude, spatial pattern and seasonal response vary significantly among the models.

New high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution}, climate reconstructions for the last millennium are based on tree-ring records from the subtropical and central Andes, northern and southern Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, New Zealand and Tasmania ({cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Boninsegna_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Villalba_et_al_2009}), ice cores, lake and marine sediments and documentary evidence from southern South America (Prieto and García Herrera, 2009; {cite.5.'Vimeux_et_al_2009}; von Gunten et al., 2009; {cite.5.'Tierney_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Neukom_et_al_2011}), terrestrial and shallow marine geological records from eastern Antarctica ({cite.5.'Verleyen_et_al_2011}), ice cores from Antarctica (Goosse et al., 2012c; {cite.5.'Abram_et_al_2013}; {cite.5.'Steig_et_al_2013}), boreholes from western Antarctica ({cite.5.'Orsi_et_al_2012}) and coral records from the Indian and Pacific Oceans ({cite.5.'Linsley_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Zinke_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Lough_2011}; {cite.5.'DeLong_et_al_2012}). There is medium confidence that southern South America ({cite.5.'Neukom_et_al_2011}) austral summer temperatures during 950–1350 were warmer than the 20th century. A 1000-year temperature {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} for land and ocean representing Australasia indicates a warm period during 1160–1370 though this reconstruction is based on only three records before 1430 (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013). In Australasia, 1971–2000 temperatures were very likely higher than any other 30-year period over the last 580 years (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013).

Antarctica was likely warmer than 1971–2000 during the late 17th century, and during the period from approximately the mid-2nd century to 1250 (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013).

In conclusion, continental scale {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} reconstructions from 950 to 1250 show multi-decadal periods that were in some regions as warm as in the mid-20th century and in others as warm as in the late 20th century (high confidence). These regional warm periods were not as synchronous across regions as the warming since the mid20th century (high confidence).
