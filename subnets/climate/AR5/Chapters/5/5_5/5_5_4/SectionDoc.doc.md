title: 5.5.4 - Monsoon Systems and Convergence Zones

This subsection focuses on internally and externally driven variability of {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} systems during the last millennium. Abrupt monsoon changes associated with Dansgaard–Oeschger and Heinrich events ({'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}b, e, h) are further assessed in Section 5.7.1. Orbital-scale monsoon ({'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}a, d, g) changes are evaluated in {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_2.5_3_2_3 Section 5.3.2.3}.

Hydrological {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} data characterizing the intensity of the East Asian monsoon (South American monsoon) show decreased (increased) hydrological activity during the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA} as compared to the {Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA} (medium confidence) ({'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}f, i) ({cite.5.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Bird_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Vuille_et_al_2012}). These shifts were accompanied by changes in the occurrence of megadroughts (high confidence) in parts of the Asian monsoon {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.5.'Buckley_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2010a}) ({'Figure_5_13 Figure 5.13}). Lake sediment data from coastal eastern Africa document dry conditions in the late MCA, a wet LIA, and return toward dry conditions in the 18th or early 19th century ({cite.5.'Verschuren_et_al_2000}; {cite.5.'Stager_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Verschuren_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Tierney_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Wolff_et_al_2011}), qualitatively similar to the South American monsoon proxies in {'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}i, whereas some inland and southern African lakes suggest dry spells during the LIA ({cite.5.'Garcin_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Anchukaitis_and_Tierney_2013}). Rainfall patterns associated with the Pacific {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} also shifted southward during the MCA/LIA transition in the central equatorial Pacific ({cite.5.'Sachs_et_al_2009}). Extended intervals of monsoon failures and dry spells have been reconstructed for the last few millennia for west Africa ({cite.5.'Shanahan_et_al_2009}), east Africa ({cite.5.'Wolff_et_al_2011}), northern Africa ({cite.5.'Esper_et_al_2007b}; {cite.5.'Touchan_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Touchan_et_al_2011}), India and southeastern Asia ({cite.5.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Berkelhammer_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Buckley_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2010a}) and Australia ({cite.5.'Mohtadi_et_al_2011}).

On multi-decadal-to-centennial time scales, influences of North Atlantic {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} variations have been demonstrated for the North and South African monsoon, and the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons (see {'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}c for monsoon regions), both using proxy reconstructions ({cite.5.'Feng_and_Hu_2008}; {cite.5.'Shanahan_et_al_2009}) and {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations ({cite.5.'Lu_et_al_2006}; {cite.5.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2006}; {cite.5.'Wang_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Luo_et_al_2011}). These simulations suggest that solar and volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.5.'Fan_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Liu_et_al_2009a}; {cite.5.'Man_et_al_2012}) may exert only weak regional influences on monsoon systems ({'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}f, i). A five-member multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean of PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations (Table 5.A.1) exhibits decreased standardized monsoon rainfall accompanying periods of reduced solar forcing during the LIA in the East Asian monsoon regions ({'Figure_5_4 Figure 5.4}f). There is, however, a considerable inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in the simulated annual mean precipitation response to solar forcing with the multi-model mean, explaining on average only ~25 ± 15% (1 standard deviation) of the variance of the individual model simulations. An assessment of the pre-instrumental response of monsoon systems to volcanic forcing using paleo-proxy data has revealed wetter conditions over southeast Asia in the year of a major volcanic eruption and drier conditions in central Asia ({cite.5.'Anchukaitis_et_al_2010}), in contrast to GCM simulations ({cite.5.'Oman_et_al_2005}; {cite.5.'Brovkin_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Fan_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Schneider_et_al_2009}).
