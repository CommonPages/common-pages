title: Box 5.1 - Polar Amplification

Polar amplification occurs if the magnitude of zonally averaged {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} change at high latitudes exceeds the globally averaged temperature change, in response to climate forcings and on time scales greater than the annual cycle. Polar amplification is of global concern due to the potential effects of future warming on {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} stability and, therefore, global {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} (see Sections {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 5.6.1} {Chapters.5.5_8.5_8_1 5.8.1} and {Chapters.13 Chapter 13}) and {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} feedbacks such as those linked with {Glossary.*Permafrost permafrost} melting (see {Chapters.6 Chapter 6}).

Some external climate forcings have an enhanced radiative impact at high latitudes, such as orbital forcing ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1.5_2_1_1 Section 5.2.1.1}), or {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon} ({Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_4 Section 8.3.4}). Here, we focus on the latitudinal response of surface temperature to {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} perturbations. The magnitude of polar amplification depends on the relative strength and duration of different climate feedbacks, which determine the transient and equilibrium response to external forcings. This box first describes the different feedbacks operating in both polar regions, and then contrasts polar amplification depicted for past high CO2 and low CO2 climates with projected temperature patterns for the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} future {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} ({Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG}) {Topics.*Emissions emission} scenario.

In the Arctic, the {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}/ocean surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} plays an important role ({cite.5.'Curry_et_al_1995}; {cite.5.'Serreze_and_Barry_2011}). With retreating sea ice, surface albedo decreases, air temperatures increase and the ocean can absorb more heat. The resulting ocean warming contributes to further sea ice melting. The sea ice/ocean surface albedo feedback can exhibit threshold behaviour when temperatures exceed the freezing point of sea ice. This may also translate into a strong seasonality of the response characteristics. Other feedbacks, including water vapour and cloud feedbacks have been suggested as important amplifiers of Arctic climate change ({cite.5.'Vavrus_2004}; {cite.5.'Abbot_and_Tziperman_2008}, 2009; {cite.5.'Graversen_and_Wang_2009}; {cite.5.'Lu_and_Cai_2009}; {cite.5.'Screen_and_Simmonds_2010}; {cite.5.'Bintanja_et_al_2011}). In continental Arctic regions with seasonal snow cover, changes in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} (RF) can heavily influence snow cover ({cite.5.'Ghatak_et_al_2010}), and thus surface albedo. Other positive feedbacks operating on time scales of decades-to-centuries in continental high-latitude regions are associated with surface vegetation changes ({cite.5.'Bhatt_et_al_2010}) and thawing permafrost (e.g., {cite.5.'Walter_et_al_2006}). On glacial-to-interglacial time scales, the very slow ice sheet–albedo response to external forcings (see {Box_5_2 Box 5.2}) is a major contributor to polar amplification in the Northern Hemisphere.

An amplified response of Southern Ocean sea surface temperature ({Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}) to radiative perturbations also emerges from the sea ice– albedo feedback. However, in contrast to the Arctic Ocean, which in parts is highly stratified, mixed-layer depths in the Southern Ocean typically exceed several hundreds of meters, which allows the ocean to take up vast amounts of heat (Böning et al., 2008; {cite.5.'Gille_2008}; {cite.5.'Sokolov_and_Rintoul_2009}) and damp the SST response to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing}. This process, and the presence of the {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} hole over the Antarctic ice sheet ({cite.5.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2002}, 2009), can affect the transient response of surface warming of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, and lead to different patterns of future polar amplification on multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales. In response to rapid atmospheric CO2 changes, {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} indeed project an asymmetric warming between the Arctic and Southern Oceans, with an earlier response in the Arctic and a delayed response in the Southern Ocean ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3 Section 12.4.3}). Above the Antarctic ice sheet, however, surface air temperature can respond quickly to radiative perturbations owing to the limited role of {Glossary.*Latent_heat_flux latent heat flux} in the surface {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets energy budget} of Antarctica.

These differences in transient and equilibrium responses of {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} on Antarctica, the Southern Ocean and over continents and oceans in the Arctic domain can explain differences in the latitudinal temperature patterns depicted in {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1} for past periods (equilibrium response) and future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} (transient response).

{Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1} illustrates the polar amplification phenomenon for three different periods of the Earth’s climate history using temperature reconstructions from natural archives and climate model simulations for: (i) the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, 54 to 48 Ma) characterised by CO2 concentrations of 1000 to 2000 ppm ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_2 Section 5.2.2.2}) and the absence of continental ice sheets; (ii) the mid-{Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} Warm Period (MPWP, 3.3 to 3.0 Ma), characterized by CO2 concentrations in the range of 350 to 450 ppm ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_2 Section 5.2.2.2}) and reduced Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets compared to today (see {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 Section 5.6.1}), (iii) the Last Glacial Maximum ({Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM}, 21 to 19 ka), characterized by CO2 concentrations around 200 ppm and large continental ice sheets covering northern Europe and North America.

Throughout all three time periods, reconstructions and simulations reveal Arctic and Antarctic surface air temperature amplification of up to two times the global mean ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}c, d), and this bipolar amplification appears to be a robust feature of the equilibrium {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} response to changes of CO2 concentration, irrespective of climate state. The absence (EECO), or expansion (LGM) of continental ice sheets has the potential to affect the zonally averaged surface temperatures due to the lapse-rate effect (see {Box_5_2 Box 5.2}), hence contributing to polar amplification. However, polar amplification is also suppressed in zonally averaged gradients of SST compared with terrestrial surface air temperature ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}), owing to the presence of high-latitude sea ice in the pre-industrial control, which places a lower limit on SST. Global mean temperature estimates for these three {Topics.*Past_Climate past climates} also imply an Earth system {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} to radiative perturbations up to two times higher than the {Glossary.*Equilibrium_climate_sensitivity equilibrium climate sensitivity} ({cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}) (see {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 Section 5.3.1} and {Box_12_2 Box 12.2}).

Polar amplification explains in part why Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) appear to be highly sensitive to relatively small increases in CO2 concentration and global mean temperature. For example, global sea level during MPWP may have been up to +20m higher than present day when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were ~350 to 450 ppm and {Glossary.*Global_mean_surface_temperature global mean surface temperature} was 2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels (see Sections {Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 5.6.1} and {Chapters.5.5_8.5_8_1 5.8.1}).

Based on earlier climate data–model comparisons, it has been claimed (summarised in {cite.5.'Huber_and_Caballero_2011}), that models underestimated the strength of polar amplification for high CO2 climates by 30 to 50%. While recent simulations of the EECO and the MPWP exhibit a wide inter-model variability, there is generally good agreement between new simulations and data, particularly if seasonal biases in some of the marine SST proxies from high-latitude sites are considered ({cite.5.'Hollis_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2013}).

Transient polar amplification as recorded in historical instrumental data and as projected by coupled climate models for the 21st century involves a different balance of feedbacks than for the “equilibrium” past states featured in {Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}. Since 1875, the Arctic north of 60°N latitude has warmed at a rate of 1.36°C per century, approximately twice as fast as the global average ({cite.5.'Bekryaev_et_al_2010}), and since 1979, Arctic land surface has warmed at an even higher rate of 0.5°C per decade (e.g., Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Gridded Dataset of Global Historical Near-Surface Air TEMperature Anomalies Over Land version 4 (CRUTEM4), {cite.5.'Jones_et_al_2012}; Hadley Centre/CRU gridded surface temperature data set version 4 (HadCRUT4), {cite.5.'Morice_et_al_2012}) (see {Chapters.2.2_4 Section 2.4}). This recent warming appears unusual in the context of reconstructions spanning the past 2000 years ({Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5}) and has been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} primarily to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} factors ({cite.5.'Gillett_et_al_2008}) (see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_4 Section 10.3.1.1.4}). The fact that the strongest warming occurs in autumn and early winter ({cite.5.'Chylek_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Serreze_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Polyakov_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Screen_and_Simmonds_2010}; {cite.5.'Semenov_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Spielhagen_et_al_2011}) strongly links Arctic amplification to feedbacks associated with the seasonal reduction in sea ice extent and duration, as well as the insulating effect of sea ice in winter (e.g., {cite.5.'Soden_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Serreze_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Serreze_and_Barry_2011}). For future model projections ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}), following the RCP8.5 {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, annual mean Arctic (68°N to 90°N) warming is expected to exceed the global average by 2.2 to 2.4 times for the period 2081–2100 compared to 1986–2005 (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_1 Section 12.4.3.1}), which corresponds to the higher end of polar amplification implied by paleo-reconstructions.

The transient response of Antarctic and Southern Ocean temperatures to the anthropogenic perturbation appears more complex, than for the Arctic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}. Zonal mean Antarctic surface warming has been modest at 0.1°C per decade over the past 50 years ({cite.5.'Steig_et_al_2009}; O’Donnell et al., 2010). The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the strongest regional warming trends (0.5°C per decade over the past 50 years), more than twice that of the global mean temperature. Central West Antarctica may have also experienced a similar strong warming {Glossary.*Trend trend}, as depicted by the only continuous meteorological station during the last 50 years ({cite.5.'Bromwich_et_al_2013}), and borehole measurements spanning the same period ({cite.5.'Orsi_et_al_2012}). {Glossary.*Ice_core Ice core} records show enhanced summer melting in the Antarctic Peninsula since the 1950, which is unprecedented over the past 1000 years ({cite.5.'Abram_et_al_2013}), and warming in West Antarctica that cannot be distinguished from natural variability over the last 2000 years ({cite.5.'Steig_et_al_2013}) (see also {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_4 Section 10.3.1.1.4}, and {Chapters.5.5_5 Section 5.5}). Polar amplification in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica is virtually absent in the transient CMIP5 RCP4.5 future simulations (2081–2100 versus 1986–2005) (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3.12_4_3_1 Section 12.4.3.1}), although CMIP5 RCP8.5 exhibits an amplified warming in the Southern Ocean ({Box_5_1 Box 5.1}, {'Box_5_1_Figure_1 Figure 1}), much smaller in magnitude than the equilibrium response implied from paleo-reconstructions for a high-CO2 world.

In summary, high confidence exists for polar amplification in either one or both hemispheres, based on robust and consistent evidence from temperature reconstructions of past climates, recent instrumental temperature records and climate model simulations of past, present and future climate changes.
