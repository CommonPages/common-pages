During the MPWP, climate conditions in the equatorial Pacific were characterized by weaker zonal ({cite.5.'Wara_et_al_2005}) and cross-equatorial ({cite.5.'Steph_et_al_2010}) {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradients, consistent with the absence of an eastern equatorial cold tongue. This state still supported interannual variability, according to {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records ({cite.5.'Scroxton_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Watanabe_et_al_2011}). These results together with recent GCM experiments ({cite.5.'Haywood_et_al_2007}) indicate (medium confidence) that interannual {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} variability existed, at least sporadically, during the warm background state of the {Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 Section 5.3.1}).

{Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} GCM simulations display wide ranges in the behaviour of ENSO and the eastern equatorial Pacific annual cycle of SST with little consistency ({cite.5.'Liu_et_al_2007a}; {cite.5.'Zheng_et_al_2008}) ({'Figure_5_10 Figure 5.10}). Currently ENSO variance reconstructions for the LGM are too uncertain to help constrain the simulated responses of the annual cycle and ENSO to LGM boundary conditions. {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} show that a reduced AMOC very likely induces intensification of ENSO amplitude and for the majority of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} also a reduction of the amplitude of the SST annual cycle in the eastern equatorial Pacific ({cite.5.'Timmermann_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Merkel_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Braconnot_et_al_2012a}) ({'Figure_5_10 Figure 5.10}). About 75% of the PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5 mid-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} simulations exhibit a weakening of interannual SST amplitude in the eastern equatorial Pacific relative to pre-industrial conditions. More than 87% of these simulations also show a concomitant substantial weakening in the amplitude of the annual cycle of eastern equatorial Pacific SST. Model results are consistent with a reduction of total variance of d18O variations of individual foraminifera in the eastern equatorial Pacific, indicative of an orbital effect on eastern equatorial Pacific SST variance ({cite.5.'Koutavas_and_Joanides_2012}). In contrast to these findings, a recent proxy study using sub-annually resolved d18O from central equatorial Pacific coral segments ({cite.5.'Cobb_et_al_2013}) reveals no evidence for orbitally-induced changes in interannual ENSO amplitude throughout the last 7 ka (high confidence), which is consistent with the weak reduction in mid-Holocene ENSO amplitude of only ~10% simulated by the majority of climate models (Fig. 5.10), but contrasts with reconstructions reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} that showed a reduction in ENSO variance during the first half of the Holocene. The same study revealed an ENSO system that experienced very large internal variance changes on decadal and centennial time scales. This latter finding is also confirmed by the analysis of about 2000 years of annually varved lake sediments ({cite.5.'Wolff_et_al_2011}) in the ENSO-teleconnected {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of equatorial East Africa. Furthermore, {cite.5.'Cobb_et_al_2013 Cobb et al. (2013)} identify the late 20th century as a period of anomalously high, although not unprecedented, ENSO variability relative to the average reconstructed variance over the last 7000 years.

Reconstructions of ENSO for the last millennium also document multi-decadal-to-centennial variations in the amplitude of reconstructed interannual eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies ({cite.5.'McGregor_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Wilson_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Li_et_al_2011}; Emile-Geay et al., 2013a). Statistical efforts to determine ENSO variance changes in different annually resolved ENSO proxies (D’Arrigo et al., 2005; {cite.5.'Braganza_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'McGregor_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Fowler_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Hereid_et_al_2013}) and from documentary sources (Garcia-Herrera et al., 2008; {cite.5.'Gergis_and_Fowler_2009}) reveal (medium confidence) extended periods of low ENSO activity during parts of the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA} compared to the 20th century. Direct {Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} effects on reconstructed multi-decadal ENSO variance changes cannot be identified ({cite.5.'McGregor_et_al_2010}). According to reconstructions of volcanic events ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1.5_2_1_3 Section 5.2.1.3}) and some ENSO proxies, a slightly increased probability exists (medium confidence) for the occurrence of El Niño events 1 to 2 years after major volcanic eruptions ({cite.5.'Adams_et_al_2003}; {cite.5.'McGregor_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Wilson_et_al_2010}). This response is not captured robustly by {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} ({cite.5.'McGregor_and_Timmermann_2010}; {cite.5.'Ohba_et_al_2013}).
