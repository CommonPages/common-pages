title: 5.4 - Modes of Climate Variability

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, new {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} reconstructions and model simulations have provided additional insights into the forced and unforced behaviour of modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. This section focuses only on the interannual {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, the {Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM} and {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}, the Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}) and longer term variability associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}) (see Glossary and {Chapters.14 Chapter 14} for definitions and illustrations and {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}). It is organized from low to high latitudes and from interannual to decadal-scale modes of variability.
