Robust evidence from {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} simulations indicates a weakening of the {Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM} variability, connected with stronger planetary wave activity (Lü et al., 2010). A significant but model-dependent distortion of the simulated LGM {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} pattern may result from the strong topographic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} forcing ({cite.5.'Justino_and_Peltier_2005}; {cite.5.'Handorf_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Pausata_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Riviere_et_al_2010}). A multimodel analysis of NAO behaviour in mid-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} simulations ({cite.5.'Gladstone_et_al_2005}) reveals an NAO structure, similar to its pre-industrial state, but a tendency for more positive NAO values during the early Holocene ({cite.5.'Rimbu_et_al_2003}), with no consistent change in its interannual variability. Robust {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} evidence to test these model-based results has not yet been established. A new 5200-year-long lake sediment record from southwestern Greenland ({cite.5.'Olsen_et_al_2012}) suggests that around 4500 and 650 years ago variability associated with the NAO changed from generally positive to variable, intermittently negative conditions. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, a few cold-season NAO reconstructions for the last centuries have been published. They are based on long instrumental pressure series ({cite.5.'Cornes_et_al_2012}), a combination of instrumental and ship log-book data (Küttel et al., 2010) and two proxy records ({cite.5.'Trouet_et_al_2009}). Whereas these and earlier NAO reconstructions ({cite.5.'Cook_et_al_2002}; {cite.5.'Luterbacher_et_al_2002}; {cite.5.'Timm_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Pinto_and_Raible_2012}) differ in several aspects, and taking into consideration associated {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, they demonstrate with high confidence that the strong positive NAO phases of the early 20th century and the mid-1990s are not unusual in the context of the past half millennium. {cite.5.'Trouet_et_al_2009 Trouet et al. (2009)} presented a winter NAO reconstruction that yielded a persistent positive phase during the {Glossary.*Medieval_Climate_Anomaly MCA} in contrast to higher frequency variability during the {Glossary.*Little_Ice_Age LIA}. This is not consistent with the strong NAO imprint in Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} data ({cite.5.'Vinther_et_al_2010}) and recent results from transient model simulations that neither support such a persistent positive NAO during the MCA, nor a strong NAO phase shift during the LIA ({cite.5.'Lehner_et_al_2012}; {cite.5.'Yiou_et_al_2012}). A recent pseudo-proxy-based assessment of low-frequency NAO behaviour ({cite.5.'Lehner_et_al_2012}) infers weaknesses in the reconstruction method used by {cite.5.'Trouet_et_al_2009 Trouet et al. (2009)}. Last millennium GCM simulations reveal no significant response of the NAO to solar forcing ({cite.5.'Yiou_et_al_2012}), except for the GISS-ER coupled model which includes {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} photochemistry, extends into the middle {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and exhibits changes in NAO that are weak during the MCA compared to the LIA ({cite.5.'Mann_et_al_2009}).

Changes in the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} modulate the strength and position of the mean SH westerlies, and leave an important signature on SH present-day surface climate ({cite.5.'Gillett_et_al_2006}) past tree-ring growth (e.g., {cite.5.'Urrutia_et_al_2011}), wildfires ({cite.5.'Holz_and_Veblen_2011}) as well as on LGM climate ({cite.5.'Justino_and_Peltier_2008}). A first hemispheric-wide, tree-ring-based reconstruction of the austral summer SAM ({cite.5.'Villalba_et_al_2012}) indicates that the late 20th century positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} may have been anomalous in the context of the last 600 years, thus supporting earlier South American proxy evidence for the last 400 years (e.g., {cite.5.'Lara_et_al_2008}) and GCM ({cite.5.'Wilmes_et_al_2012}). Hence, there is medium confidence that the positive trend in SAM since 1950 may be anomalous compared to the last 400 years.

The {Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO} ({cite.5.'Delworth_and_Mann_2000}; {cite.5.'Knight_et_al_2005}) (see also Sections {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_3.9_5_3_3_2 9.5.3.3.2} and {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_6 14.7.6}) has been reconstructed using marine ({cite.5.'Black_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Kilbourne_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Sicre_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Chiessi_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Saenger_et_al_2009}) and terrestrial proxy records ({cite.5.'Gray_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Shanahan_et_al_2009}) from different locations. Correlations among different AMO reconstructions decrease rapidly prior to 1900 ({cite.5.'Winter_et_al_2011}). An 8000-year long AMO reconstruction ({cite.5.'Knudsen_et_al_2011}) shows no correlation with {Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} changes, and is interpreted as internally generated ocean-{Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} variability. However, GCM experiments ({cite.5.'Waple_et_al_2002}; {cite.5.'Ottera_et_al_2010}) using solar and/ or volcanic forcing reconstructions indicate that {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} may have played a role in driving or at least acting as pacemaker for AMO variations.
