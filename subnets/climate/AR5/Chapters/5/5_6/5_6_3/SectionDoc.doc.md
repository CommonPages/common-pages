title: 5.6.3 - Last Glacial Termination and Holocene

The onset of melting of the {Glossary.*Last_Glacial_Maximum LGM} ice sheets occurred at approximately 20 ka and was followed by a GMSL rise of ~130 m in ~13 kyr ({cite.5.'Lambeck_et_al_2002b}). Coeval with the onset of the Bølling warming in the NH, a particularly rapid rise of ~ 20 m occurred within ~ 340 years (Meltwater Pulse 1A, {Glossary.*Medieval_Warm_Period MWP}-1A), as most recently documented by {cite.5.'Deschamps_et_al_2012 Deschamps et al. (2012)} from a new Tahiti coral record. At this location sea level rose between 14 and 18 m at a rate approaching 5 m per century. The {Glossary.*Source source} of MWP-1A continues to be widely debated with most attention being on {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} in which the Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} contributed either significantly ({cite.5.'Clark_et_al_2002}, 2009; {cite.5.'Bassett_et_al_2005}) or very little ({cite.5.'Bentley_et_al_2010}; {cite.5.'Mackintosh_et_al_2011}). Evidence of rapid WAIS retreat at around the time of MWP-1A is also indicated by analysis of marine sediment cores (e.g., {cite.5.'Kilfeather_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Smith_et_al_2011}).

If the Antarctic ice sheet was the major contributor to MWP-1A then it must have contained at least 7·106 km3 more ice than at present (equivalent to ~17 m GMSL), which is about twice the difference in Antarctic ice volume between the LGM and present found by {cite.5.'Whitehouse_et_al_2012 Whitehouse et al. (2012)}. Because of the Earth-ocean (including gravitational, deformational and rotational) response to rapid changes in ice volume, the amplitude of the associated {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} is spatially variable ({cite.5.'Clark_et_al_2002}) and can provide insight into the source {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}. Based on the comparison of the new Tahiti record with records from Barbados ({cite.5.'Fairbanks_1989}) and the Sunda Shelf ({cite.5.'Hanebuth_et_al_2011}), {cite.5.'Deschamps_et_al_2012 Deschamps et al. (2012)} conclude that a significant meltwater contribution to GMSL, of at least 7 m, originated from Antarctica. From ice sheet modelling, {cite.5.'Gregoire_et_al_2012 Gregoire et al. (2012)} argued that the separation of the North American Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets may in part be the cause of MWP-1A, contributing ~9 m in 500 years. Another ice sheet modelling study {cite.5.'Carlson_et_al_2012 Carlson et al. (2012)} suggests a contribution of 6 to 8 m in 500 years from the Laurentide at the onset of the Bølling warming over North America. These studies indicate that there are no glaciological impediments to a major North American contribution to MWP-1A. In contrast, there are as yet no modelling results that show a rapid retreat or partial collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet at that time.

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} sea level records from different localities suggest further periods of rapid ice-mass loss. For example, records from Singapore indicate a rise of ~14 m from ~9.5 to 8.0 ka followed by a short interval of a smaller rise centred on about 7.2 ka ({cite.5.'Bird_et_al_2010}, for Singapore) and records from the US Atlantic ({cite.5.'Cronin_et_al_2007}) and North Sea coasts ({cite.5.'Hijma_and_Cohen_2010}) suggest a rise at around ~9.0–7.5 ka that is possibly punctuated by one or two short intervals of higher rates. These and similar rapid events have to be interpreted against a background of rapid rise that is spatially variable because of the residual {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} response to the last {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} ({cite.5.'Milne_and_Mitrovica_2008}). Different explanations of these short-duration events have been proposed: a multi-stage draining of glacial Lake Agassiz ({cite.5.'Hijma_and_Cohen_2010}), although estimates of the amount of water stored in this lake are less than the required amount; a rapid melting of the Labrador and Baffin ice domes ({cite.5.'Carlson_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Gregoire_et_al_2012}); or to Antarctic ice sheet decay ({cite.5.'Bird_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Cronin_et_al_2007}).

Ocean volume between about 7 ka and 3 ka is likely to have increased by an equivalent sea level rise of 2 to 3 m ({cite.5.'Lambeck_et_al_2004b}, 2010) ({'Figure_5_17 Figure 5.17}). About 10% of this increase can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to a midto-late-{Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} ice reduction over Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica ({cite.5.'Stone_et_al_2003}). Elevation histories derived from central Greenland {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} data ({cite.5.'Vinther_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Lecavalier_et_al_2013}) have presented evidence for thinning from 8 ka to 6 ka but no integrated observation-based estimate for the total ice sheet is available. Contributions from mountain glaciers for this interval are unknown.

Resolving decimeter-scale sea level fluctuations is critical for understanding the causes of {Glossary.*Sea_level_change sea level change} during the last few millennia. Three types of proxies have this capability: salt-marsh plants and microfauna (foraminifera and {Glossary.*Diatoms diatoms}) that form distinctive elevation zones reflecting variations in tolerances to the frequency and duration of tidal inundation ({cite.5.'Donnelly_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Horton_and_Edwards_2006}; {cite.5.'Gehrels_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Kemp_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Long_et_al_2012}); coral microatolls found in intertidal environments close to lowest spring tides

({cite.5.'Woodroffe_and_McLean_1990}; {cite.5.'Smithers_and_Woodroffe_2001}; {cite.5.'Goodwin_and_Harvey_2008}); and coastal archaeological features constructed with direct (e.g., fish ponds and certain harbour structures) or indirect (e.g., changes in water-table level in ancient wells) relationships to sea level ({cite.5.'Lambeck_et_al_2004b}; {cite.5.'Sivan_et_al_2004}; {cite.5.'Auriemma_and_Solinas_2009}; {cite.5.'Anzidei_et_al_2011}). Of these, the salt-marsh records are particularly important because they have been validated against regional tide-gauge records and because they can provide near-continuous records. The most robust signal captured in the salt-marsh proxy sea level records from both the NH and SH is an increase in rate, late in the 19th or in the early 20th century ({'Figure_5_17 Figure 5.17}), that marks a transition from relatively low rates of change during the late Holocene (order tenths of mm yr–1) to modern rates (order mm yr–1) (see also {FAQ_5_2 FAQ 5.2}). Variability in both the magnitude and the timing (1840–1920) of this acceleration has been reported ({cite.5.'Gehrels_et_al_2006}, 2008, 2011; {cite.5.'Kemp_et_al_2009}, 2011), but {cite.5.'Gehrels_and_Woodworth_2013 Gehrels and Woodworth (2013)} have concluded that these mismatches can be reconciled within the observational {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}. Combined with the instrumental evidence (see {Chapters.3.3_7 Section 3.7}) and with inferences drawn from archaeological evidence from 2000 years ago ({cite.5.'Lambeck_et_al_2004b}), rates of sea level rise exceeded the late Holocene background rate after about 1900 (high confidence) ({'Figure_5_17 Figure 5.17}).

Regionally, as along the US Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico coast, the salt-marsh records reveal some consistency in multi-decadal and centennial time scales deviations from the linear trends expected from the {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} signal (see e.g., panels (a) and (b) in {'Figure_5_17 Figure 5.17}) (van de Plassche et al., 1998; González and Törnqvist, 2009; {cite.5.'Kemp_et_al_2011}) but they have not yet been identified as truly global phenomena. For the past 5 millennia the most complete sea level record from a single location consists of microatoll evidence from Kiritimati (Christmas Island; Pacific Ocean) ({cite.5.'Woodroffe_et_al_2012}) that reveals with medium confidence that amplitudes of any fluctuations in GMSL during this interval did not exceed approximately ±25 cm on time scales of a few hundred years. {Glossary.*Proxy Proxy} data from other localities with quasi-continuous records for parts of this pre-industrial period, likewise, do not identify significant global oscillations on centennial time scales ({'Figure_5_17 Figure 5.17}).
