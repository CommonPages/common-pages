title: 5.6.1 - Mid-Pliocene Warm Period

Estimates of peak sea levels during the MPWP ({'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}, {Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 Section 5.3.1}) based on a variety of geological records are consistent in suggesting higher-than-present sea levels, but they range widely (10 to 30 m; {cite.5.'Miller_et_al_2012a}), and are each subject to large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}. For example, coastal records (shorelines, continental margin sequences) are influenced by {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA}, with magnitudes of the order of 5 m to 30 m for sites in the far and near fields of ice sheets, respectively ({cite.5.'Raymo_et_al_2011}), and global mantle dynamic processes ({cite.5.'Moucha_et_al_2008}; Müller et al., 2008) may contribute up to an additional ±10 m. Consequently, both signals can be as large as the {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} estimate itself and current estimates of their amplitudes are uncertain.

Benthic d18O records are better dated than many coastal records and provide a continuous time series, but the d18O signal reflects ice volume, temperature and regional hydrographic variability. During the mid-{Glossary.*Pliocene Pliocene} warm interval, the 0.1 to 0.25‰ anomalies recorded in the LR04 benthic d18O stack ({cite.5.'Lisiecki_and_Raymo_2005}) would translate into ~12 to 31 m higher than present GMSL, if they reflected only ice volume. Conversely, these anomalies could be explained entirely by warmer deep-water temperatures ({cite.5.'Dowsett_et_al_2009}). Attempts to constrain the temperature component in benthic d18O records conclude higher than present GMSL during the MPWP with large uncertainties (±10 m) ({cite.5.'Dwyer_and_Chandler_2009}; {cite.5.'Naish_and_Wilson_2009}; {cite.5.'Sosdian_and_Rosenthal_2009}; {cite.5.'Miller_et_al_2012a}).

The first appearance of ice-rafted debris across the entire North Atlantic indicates that continental-scale ice sheets in North America and Eurasia did not develop until about 2.7 Ma ({cite.5.'Kleiven_et_al_2002}). This suggests that MPWP high sea levels were due to mass loss from the GIS, the WAIS and possibly the East Antarctic {Glossary.*Ice_sheet Ice sheet} (EAIS). Sedimentary record from the Ross Sea indicates that the WAIS and the marine margin of EAIS retreated periodically during obliquity-paced interglacial periods of MPWP ({cite.5.'Naish_et_al_2009a}). Reconstructed SSTs for the ice free seasons in the Ross Sea range from 2°C to 8°C ({cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2012b}), with mean values >5°C being, according to one ice sheet model, above the stability threshold for ice shelves and marine portions of the WAIS and EAIS ({cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}; see also {Chapters.5.5_8.5_8_1 Section 5.8.1}). A synthesis of the geological evidence from the coastal regions of the Transantarctic Mountains ({cite.5.'Barrett_2013}) and an iceberg-rafted debris record offshore of Prydz Bay ({cite.5.'Passchier_2011}) also supports coastal thinning and retreat of the EAIS between about 5 to 2.7 Ma. In response to Pliocene climate, ice sheet models consistently produce near-complete {Glossary.*Deglaciation_glacial_termination deglaciation} of GIS (+7 m) and WAIS (+4 m) and retreat of the marine margins of EAIS (+3 m) ({cite.5.'Lunt_et_al_2008}; {cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}; {cite.5.'Hill_et_al_2010}), altogether corresponding to a GMSL rise of up to 14 m.

In summary, there is high confidence that GMSL was above present, due to deglaciation of GIS, WAIS and areas of EAIS, and that sea level was not higher than 20 m above present during the {Glossary.*Interglacials_or_interglaciations interglacials} of the MPWP.
