title: 5.6 - Past Changes in Sea Level

This section discusses evidence for global mean {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} (GMSL) change from key periods. The MPWP ({'Table_5_1 Table 5.1}) has been selected as a period of higher than present sea level ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_1 Section 5.6.1}), warmer temperature ({Chapters.5.5_3.5_3_1 Section 5.3.1}) and 350-450 ppm atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration ({Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_2.5_2_2_2 Section 5.2.2.2}). Of the recent interglacial periods with evidence for higher than present sea level, the {Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG} has the best-preserved record ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_2 Section 5.6.2}). For testing glacio-{Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} adjustment ({Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA}) models, the principal characteristics of Termination I, including Meltwater Pulse-1A ({Chapters.5.5_6.5_6_3 Section 5.6.3}) is assessed. For the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene}, the emphasis is on the last 6000 years when ice volumes stabilized near present-day values, providing the baseline for discussion of {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} contributions.
