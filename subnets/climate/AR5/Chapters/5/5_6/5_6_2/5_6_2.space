  |There is very high confidence that the maximum GMSL during the {Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG} was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present but that GMSL at this time did not exceed 10 m. There is evidence for two intra-LIG {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} peaks during which sea level varied by up to 4 m. The millennial-scale rate of sea level rise during these periods exceeded 2 m kyrâ€“1.
