title: 5.6.2 - The Last Interglacial

{Glossary.*Proxy Proxy} indicators of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level}, including emergent shoreline deposits ({cite.5.'Blanchon_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Thompson_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Dutton_and_Lambeck_2012}) and foraminiferal d18O records ({cite.5.'Siddall_et_al_2003}; {cite.5.'Rohling_et_al_2008a}; {cite.5.'Grant_et_al_2012}) are used to reconstruct {Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG} sea levels. Implicit in these reconstructions is that geophysical processes affecting the elevation of the sea level indicators (uplift, subsidence, {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA}) have been properly modelled and/or that the sea level component of the stable isotope signal has been properly isolated. Particularly important issues with regard to the LIG are (1) the ongoing debate on its initiation and duration (cf. 130 to 116 ka, {cite.5.'Stirling_et_al_1998}; 124 to 119 ka, {cite.5.'Thompson_and_Goldstein_2005}), due to coral geochronology issues; (2) the magnitude of its maximum rise; and (3) sea level variability within the interval. Foraminiferal d18O records can constrain (2) and possibly (3). Emergent shorelines on tectonically active coasts can constrain (1) and (3) and possibly (2) if vertical tectonic rates are independently known. Shorelines on tectonically stable coasts can constrain all three issues. Here evidence from emergent shorelines that can be dated directly is emphasized.
