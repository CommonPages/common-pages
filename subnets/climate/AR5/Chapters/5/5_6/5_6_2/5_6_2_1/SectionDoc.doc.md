title: 5.6.2.1 - Magnitude of the Last Interglacial Sea Level Rise

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessed that global {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} was likely between 4 and 6 m higher during the {Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG} than in the 20th century. Since AR4, two studies ({cite.5.'Kopp_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Dutton_and_Lambeck_2012}) have addressed {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} effects from observations of coastal sites.

{cite.5.'Kopp_et_al_2009 Kopp et al. (2009)} obtained a probabilistic estimate of GMSL based on a large and geographically broadly distributed database of LIG sea level indicators ({'Figure_5_15 Figure 5.15}a). Their analysis accounted for GIA effects as well as {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in geochronology, the interpretation of sea level indicators, and regional tectonic uplift and subsidence. They concluded that GMSL was very likely +6.6 m and likely +8.0 m relative to present, and that it is unlikely to have exceeded +9.4 m, although some of the most rapid and sustained rates of change occur in the early period when GMSL was still below present ({'Figure_5_15 Figure 5.15}a).

{cite.5.'Dutton_and_Lambeck_2012 Dutton and Lambeck (2012)} used data from two tectonically stable farfield areas (areas far from the former centres of glaciation), Australia and the Seychelles islands. At these sites, in contrast to sites near the former ice margins, the {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} signals are less sensitive to the choice of parameters defining the Earth rheology and the glacial ice sheets ({cite.5.'Lambeck_et_al_2012}). On the west coast of Australia, the highest LIG reef elevations are at +3.5 m and the inferred paleo-sea level, allowing for possible reef erosion, is about +5.5 m relative to present. In the Seychelles, LIG coral reefs occur from 0 m to 6 m, but also possibly as high as ~9 m ({cite.5.'Israelson_and_Wohlfarth_1999}, and references therein). Ten of the eleven LIG coral samples from the Seychelles used in {cite.5.'Dutton_and_Lambeck_2012 Dutton and Lambeck (2012)} have reef elevation estimates ranging from +2.1 to +4 m relative to present; whereas a single LIG coral sample has a reef elevation estimate of +6 m. Additional results are needed to support an estimate of a maximum LIG sea level at the Seychelles of + 9 m relative to present.

In conclusion, there is very high confidence that the maximum GMSL during the LIG was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present but that GMSL at this time did not exceed 10 m (high confidence). The best estimate from the two available studies is 6 m higher than present.
