title: 5.6.2.3 - Implications for Ice Sheet Loss During the Last Interglacial

The principal sources for the additional {Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG} meltwater are the GIS, WAIS and the low elevation, marine-based margins of the EAIS. An upper limit for the contributions from mountain glaciers is ~0.42 ± 0.11 m if all present-day mountain glaciers melted (cf. {Chapters.4.4_3 Section 4.3}). The estimated LIG ocean {Glossary.*Thermal_expansion thermal expansion} contribution is 0.4 ± 0.3 m ({cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2011}).

Sedimentological evidence indicates that southern Greenland was not ice-free during the LIG ({cite.5.'Colville_et_al_2011}). Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the evidence for LIG ice layers in Greenland ice cores, which was ambiguous from Dye 3 and unequivocal from Summit and NGRIP ice cores (summarised in Masson-Delmotte et al., 2011a), has been strengthened. Data from the new NEEM {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} (NEEM community members, 2013; see {'Figure_5_16 Figure 5.16} for locations) point to an unequivocal existence of ice throughout the LIG with elevations differing a few hundred meter from present, possibly decreasing in elevation by ~ 400 m ± 350 m between 128 and 122 ka BP. GIS simulations give an average contribution of ~2.3 m to LIG GMSL (1.5 m, 1.9 m, 1.4 m and 4.3 m respectively for four models illustrated in {'Figure_5_16 Figure 5.16}). Each model result has been selected from a series of runs within a range of parameter {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} that yield {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predictions} consistent with the occurrence of ice at NEEM and the elevation of that ice reconstructed from the ice core record. In summary, the GIS simulations that are consistent with elevation changes from the ice core analysis show limited ice retreat during this period such that this {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} equivalent, implying with medium confidence a contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet.

One model of WAIS glacial–interglacial variability shows very little difference in ice volumes between the LIG and present ({cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}) ({'Figure_5_15 Figure 5.15}g), when the surface climate and ocean melt term were parameterised using the global benthic d18O record for the last 5 Ma. Direct geological evidence of fluctuations in the extent of WAIS margin during the LIG is equivocal due to inadequate age control on two sediment cores which imply that open-water conditions existed in the southeastern sector of the Ross Ice Shelf at some time in the last 1 Ma ({cite.5.'Scherer_et_al_1998}; {cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2011}; {cite.5.'Vaughan_et_al_2011}) and in the vicinity of the northwestern Ross Ice Shelf within the last 250,000 years during MIS 7 or LIG ({cite.5.'McKay_et_al_2012a}). Ackert et al. (2011) dated glacial erratics and moraines across the Ohio Mountain Range of the Transantarctic Mountains and concluded that the ice elevations were similar during the LIG and today, but such results cannot be extrapolated beyond this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}. East Antarctic ice core LIG data may reflect the impact of a reduced WAIS due to climatic effects ({cite.5.'Holden_et_al_2010b}) but not through {Glossary.*Isostatic_or_Isostasy isostatic} effects ({cite.5.'Bradley_et_al_2012}). Modelling and ice core data suggest EAIS may have retreated in the Wilkes Basin ({cite.5.'Bradley_et_al_2012}).

In summary, no reliable quantification of the contribution of the Antarctic ice volume to LIG sea level is currently possible. The only available transient ice sheet model simulation ({cite.5.'Pollard_and_DeConto_2009}) does not have realistic boundary conditions, not enough is known about the subsurface temperatures and there are few direct observational constraints on the location of ice margins during this period. If the above inference of the contribution to GMSL from the GIS (5.6.2.1) is correct, the full GMSL change (section 5.6.2.2) implies significantly less LIG ice in Antarctica than today, but as yet this cannot be supported by the observational and model evidence.
