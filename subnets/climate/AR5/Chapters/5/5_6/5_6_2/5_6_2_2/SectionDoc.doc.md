title: 5.6.2.2 - Evidence for Last Interglacial Sea Level Variability

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, there is evidence for meter-scale variability in local {Glossary.*Last_Interglacial LIG} sea level between 126 ka and 120 ka ({cite.5.'Thompson_and_Goldstein_2005}; {cite.5.'Hearty_et_al_2007}; {cite.5.'Rohling_et_al_2008a}; {cite.5.'Kopp_et_al_2009}; {cite.5.'Thompson_et_al_2011}). However, there are considerable differences in the timing and amplitude of the reported fluctuations due to regional sea level variability and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in sea level proxies and their ages.

Two episodes of reef building during the LIG have been reported on the Yucatan coast ({cite.5.'Blanchon_et_al_2009}) and in the Bahamas ({cite.5.'Chen_et_al_1991}; {cite.5.'Thompson_et_al_2011}). {cite.5.'Blanchon_et_al_2009 Blanchon et al. (2009)} provide evidence of Yucatan reef growth early in the LIG at a relative sea level of +3 m, followed by a later episode at +6 m. {cite.5.'Thompson_et_al_2011 Thompson et al. (2011)} inferred a +4 m relative sea level at ~123 ka, followed by a fall to near present, and finally a rise to +6 m at ~119 ka. This yields a rate of {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change} in the Bahamas of ~2.6 m kyr–1, although the higher estimate at the end of the interval may reflect {Glossary.*Glacial_isostatic_adjustment GIA} effects that result in a rise in relative sea level at these locations ({cite.5.'Dutton_and_Lambeck_2012}).

LIG sea level rise rates of between 1.1 and 2.6 m per century have been estimated based on a foraminiferal d18O record from the Red Sea ({cite.5.'Rohling_et_al_2008a}). However, the original Red-Sea {Glossary.*Chronology chronology} was based on a short LIG duration of 124 to 119 ka, after {cite.5.'Thompson_and_Goldstein_2005 Thompson and Goldstein (2005)}. The longer LIG duration of 130 to 116 ka indicated by the coral data ({cite.5.'Stirling_et_al_1998}) reduces these rates to 0.4 to 0.9 m per century, and a revised chronology of the Red Sea sea level record adjusted to ages from Soreq Cave yields estimates of sea level rise rates of up to 0.7 m per century when sea level was above present level during the LIG ({cite.5.'Grant_et_al_2012}).

In their probabilistic assessment of LIG sea level, {cite.5.'Kopp_et_al_2013 Kopp et al. (2013)} concluded that it was extremely likely that there were at least two peaks in sea level during the LIG. They further concluded that during the interval following the initial peak at ~126 ka ({'Figure_5_15 Figure 5.15}a) it is likely that there was a period in which GMSL rose at an average rate exceeding 3 m kyr–1, but unlikely that this rate exceeded 7 m kyr–1.

In summary, there is evidence for two intra-LIG sea level peaks (high confidence) during which sea level varied by up to 4 m (medium confidence). The millennial-scale rate of sea level rise during these periods exceeded 2 m kyr–1 (high confidence).
