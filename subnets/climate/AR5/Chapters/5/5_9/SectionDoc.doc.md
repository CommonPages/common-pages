title: 5.9 - Concluding Remarks

The assessments in this chapter are based on a rapidly growing body of new evidence from the peer-review literature. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, there exists a wide range of new information on past changes in atmospheric composition, sea level, {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climates} including droughts and floods, as well as new results from internationally coordinated {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} on {Topics.*Past_Climate past climates} (PMIP3/CMIP5). At the regional scale proxybased temperature estimates are still scarce for key regions such as Africa, India and parts of the Americas. Syntheses of past precipitation changes were too limited to support regional assessments.

Precise knowledge of past changes in atmospheric concentrations of {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect well-mixed GHGs} prior to the period for which {Glossary.*Ice_core ice core} records are available remains a strong limitation on assessing longer-term climate change. Key limitations to our knowledge of past climate continues to be associated with {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} of the quantitative information derived from climate proxies, in particular due to seasonality effects, the lack of {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records sensitive to winter temperature, or the precise water depth at which ocean proxies signals form. Moreover, methodological uncertainties associated with regional, hemispheric or global syntheses need to be further investigated and quantified.

Despite progress on developing proxy records of past changes in {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} it is not yet possible to provide quantitative and spatially coherent assessments of past sea ice cover in both polar oceans.

While this assessment could build on improved reconstructions of abrupt climate changes during glacial periods, key questions remain open regarding the underlying cause of these changes. Large uncertainties remain on the variations experienced by the West and East Antarctic ice sheets over various time scales of the past. Regarding past {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change}, major difficulties are associated with deconvolving changes in ocean geodynamic effects, as well as for inferring global signals from regional reconstructions.

The PMIP3/CMIP5 model framework offers the opportunity to directly incorporate information from {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} data and simulations into assessments of future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}. This is an emerging field for which only preliminary information was available for AR5.
