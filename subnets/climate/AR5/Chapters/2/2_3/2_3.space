title: 2.3 - Changes in Radiation Budgets
section 2_3

  |The {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget} of the Earth is a central element of the climate system. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, knowledge on the magnitude of the radiative energy fluxes in the climate system has improved. Newly available observations allow a better quantification of the Global Energy Budget. It is unlikely that significant trends exist in global and tropical radiation budgets since 2000. The evidence for widespread multi-decadal variations in {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} incident on land surfaces has been substantiated since AR4, with many of the observational records showing a decline from the 1950s to the 1980s (‘dimming’), and a partial recovery thereafter (‘brightening’).
