title: 2.3.1 - Global Mean Radiation Budget

Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, knowledge on the magnitude of the radiative energy fluxes in the climate system has improved, requiring an update of the global annual mean {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} diagram ({'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}). Energy exchanges between Sun, Earth and Space are observed from space-borne platforms such as the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES, {cite.2.'Wielicki_et_al_1996}) and the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE, {cite.2.'Kopp_and_Lawrence_2005}) which began data collection in 2000 and 2003, respectively. The total solar irradiance ({Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI}) incident at the TOA is now much better known, with the SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) instrument reporting {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} as low as 0.035%, compared to 0.1% for other TSI instruments ({cite.2.'Kopp_et_al_2005}). During the 2008 solar minimum, SORCE/TIM observed a solar irradiance of 1360.8 ± 0.5 W m–2 compared to 1365.5 ± 1.3 W m–2 for instruments launched prior to SORCE and still operating in 2008 ({Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_1 Section 8.4.1.1}). {cite.2.'Kopp_and_Lean_2011 Kopp and Lean (2011)} conclude that the SORCE/TIM value of TSI is the most credible value because it is validated by a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated cryogenic radiometer. This revised TSI estimate corresponds to a solar irradiance close to 340 W m–2 globally averaged over the Earth’s sphere ({'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}).

The estimate for the reflected {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} at the TOA in {'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}, 100 W m–2, is a rounded value based on the CERES Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) satellite data product ({cite.2.'Loeb_et_al_2009}, 2012b) for the period 2001–2010. This data set adjusts the solar and thermal TOA fluxes within their range of uncertainty to be consistent with independent estimates of the global heating rate based on in situ ocean observations ({cite.2.'Loeb_et_al_2012b}). This leaves 240 W m–2 of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth, which is nearly balanced by thermal {Topics.*Emissions emission} to space of about 239 W m–2 (based on CERES EBAF), considering a global heat storage of 0.6 W m–2 (imbalance term in {'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}) based on Argo data from 2005 to 2010 ({cite.2.'Hansen_et_al_2011}; {cite.2.'Loeb_et_al_2012b}; {Box_3_1 Box 3.1}). The stated uncertainty in the solar reflected TOA fluxes from CERES due to uncertainty in absolute calibration alone is about 2% (2-sigma), or equivalently 2 W m–2 ({cite.2.'Loeb_et_al_2009}). The uncertainty of the outgoing thermal flux at the TOA as measured by CERES due to calibration is ~3.7 W m–2 (2σ). In addition to this, there is uncertainty in removing the influence of instrument spectral response on measured radiance, in radiance-to-flux conversion, and in time– space averaging, which adds up to another 1 W m–2 ({cite.2.'Loeb_et_al_2009}).

The components of the {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget} at the surface are generally more uncertain than their counterparts at the TOA because they cannot be directly measured by passive satellite sensors and surface measurements are not always regionally or globally representative. Since AR4, new estimates for the downward thermal infrared (IR) radiation at the surface have been established that incorporate critical information on cloud base heights from space-borne radar and lidar instruments (L’Ecuyer et al., 2008; {cite.2.'Stephens_et_al_2012a}; Kato et al., 2013). In line with studies based on direct surface radiation measurements ({cite.2.'Wild_et_al_1998}, 2013) these studies propose higher values of global mean downward thermal radiation than presented in previous IPCC assessments and typically found in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, exceeding 340 W m–2 ({'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}). This aligns with the downward thermal radiation in the ERA-Interim and ERA-40 reanalyses ({Box_2_3 Box 2.3}), of 341 and 344 W m–2, respectively ({cite.2.'Berrisford_et_al_2011}). Estimates of global mean downward thermal radiation computed as a residual of the other terms of the surface {Glossary.*Energy_budget_of_the_Earth energy budget} ({cite.2.'Kiehl_and_Trenberth_1997}; {cite.2.'Trenberth_et_al_2009}) are lower (324 to 333 W m–2), highlighting remaining uncertainties in estimates of both radiative and non-radiative components of the surface energy budget.

Estimates of absorbed solar radiation at the Earth’s surface include considerable uncertainty. Published global mean values inferred from satellite retrievals, reanalyses and climate models range from below 160 W m–2 to above 170 W m–2. Recent studies taking into account surface observations as well as updated spectroscopic parameters and continuum absorption for water vapor favour values towards the lower bound of this range, near 160 W m–2, and an atmospheric solar absorption around 80 W m–2 ({'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}) ({cite.2.'Kim_and_Ramanathan_2008}; {cite.2.'Trenberth_et_al_2009}; {cite.2.'Kim_and_Ramanathan_2012}; {cite.2.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2012b}; {cite.2.'Wild_et_al_2013}). The ERA-Interim and ERA-40 reanalyses further support an atmospheric solar absorption of this magnitude ({cite.2.'Berrisford_et_al_2011}). Latest satellite-derived estimates constrained by CERES now also come close to these values (Kato et al., in press). Recent independently derived surface radiation estimates favour therefore a global mean surface absorbed solar flux near 160 W m–2 and a downward thermal flux slightly above 340 W m–2, respectively ({'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}).

The global mean {Glossary.*Latent_heat_flux latent heat flux} is required to exceed 80 W m–2 to close the surface energy balance in {'Figure_2_11 Figure 2.11}, and comes close to the 85 W m–2 considered as upper limit by {cite.2.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2012b Trenberth and Fasullo (2012b)} in view of current uncertainties in precipitation retrieval in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP, {cite.2.'Adler_et_al_2012}) (the latent heat flux corresponds to the energy equivalent of evaporation, which globally equals precipitation; thus its magnitude may be constrained by global precipitation estimates). This upper limit has recently been challenged by {cite.2.'Stephens_et_al_2012b Stephens et al. (2012b)}. The emerging debate reflects potential remaining deficiencies in the quantification of the radiative and non-radiative energy balance components and associated uncertainty ranges, as well as in the consistent representation of the global mean energy and water budgets ({cite.2.'Stephens_et_al_2012b}; {cite.2.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2012b}; {cite.2.'Wild_et_al_2013}). Relative uncertainty in the globally averaged {Glossary.*Sensible_heat_flux sensible heat flux} estimate remains high owing to the very limited direct observational constraints ({cite.2.'Trenberth_et_al_2009}; {cite.2.'Stephens_et_al_2012b}).

In summary, newly available observations from both space-borne and surface-based platforms allow a better quantification of the Global Energy Budget, even though notable uncertainties remain, particularly in the estimation of the non-radiative surface energy balance components.
