title: 2.3 - Changes in Radiation Budgets

The {Topics.*Radiation_Budgets radiation budget} of the Earth is a central element of the climate system. On average, radiative processes warm the surface and cool the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, which is balanced by the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle} and sensible heating. Spatial and temporal energy imbalances due to radiation and latent heating produce the {Glossary.*General_circulation general circulation} of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and oceans. {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} influence on climate occurs primarily through perturbations of the components of the Earth radiation budget.

The radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) includes the absorption of {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} by the Earth, determined as the difference between the incident and reflected solar radiation at the TOA, as well as the thermal outgoing radiation emitted to space. The surface radiation budget takes into account the solar fluxes absorbed at the Earthâ€™s surface, as well as the upward and downward thermal radiative fluxes emitted by the surface and atmosphere, respectively. In view of new observational evidence since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the mean state as well as multi-decadal changes of the surface and TOA radiation budgets are assessed in the following.
