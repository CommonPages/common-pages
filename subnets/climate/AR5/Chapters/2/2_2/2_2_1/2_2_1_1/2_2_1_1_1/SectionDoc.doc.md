title: 2.2.1.1.1 - Carbon Dioxide

Precise, accurate systematic measurements of atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} at Mauna Loa, Hawaii and South Pole were started by C. D. Keeling from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the late 1950s ({cite.2.'Keeling_et_al_1976a}; {cite.2.'Keeling_et_al_1976b}). The 1750 globally averaged abundance of atmospheric CO2 based on measurements of air extracted from ice cores and from firn is 278 ± 2 ppm ({cite.2.'Etheridge_et_al_1996}). Globally averaged CO2 mole fractions since the start of the instrumental record are plotted in {'Figure_2_1 Figure 2.1}. The main features in the contemporary CO2 record are the long-term increase and the seasonal cycle resulting from {Glossary.*Photosynthesis photosynthesis} and {Glossary.*Respiration respiration} by the terrestrial {Topics.*Climate_System biosphere}, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The main contributors to increasing atmospheric CO2 abundance are fossil fuel combustion and {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change} ({Chapters.6.6_3 Section 6.3}). Multiple lines of observational evidence indicate that during the past few decades, most of the increasing {Glossary.*Burden atmospheric burden} of CO2 is from fossil fuel combustion ({cite.2.'Tans_2009}). Since the last year for which the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} reported (2005), CO2 has increased by 11.7 ppm to 390.5 ppm in 2011 ({'Table_2_1 Table 2.1}). From 1980 to 2011, the average annual increase in globally averaged CO2 (from 1 January in one year to 1 January in the next year) was 1.7 ppm yr–1 (1 standard deviation = 0.5 ppm yr–1; 1 ppm globally corresponds to 2.1 PgC increase in the atmospheric burden). Since 2001, CO2 has increased at 2.0 ppm yr–1 (1 standard deviation = 0.3 ppm yr–1). The CO growth rate varies from year to year; since 1980 the range in annual increase is 0.7 ± 0.1 ppm in 1992 to 2.9 ± 0.1 ppm in 1998. Most of this interannual variability in growth rate is driven by small changes in the balance between photosynthesis and respiration on land, each having global fluxes of ~120 PgC yr–1 ({Chapters.6 Chapter 6}).
