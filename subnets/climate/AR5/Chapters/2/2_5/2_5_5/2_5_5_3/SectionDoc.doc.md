{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} reported positive decadal trends in lower and upper tropospheric water vapour based on satellite observations for the period 1988–2004. Since AR4, there has been continued evidence for increases in lower tropospheric water vapour from microwave satellite measurements of column integrated water vapour over oceans ({cite.2.'Santer_et_al_2007}; {cite.2.'Wentz_et_al_2007}) and globally from satellite measurements of spectrally resolved reflected {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} ({cite.2.'Mieruch_et_al_2008}). The interannual variability and longer-term trends in column-integrated water vapour over oceans are closely tied to changes in {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} at the global scale and interannual anomalies show remarkable agreement with low-level {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} anomalies from HadCRUH (O’Gorman et al., 2012). The rate of moistening at large spatial scales over oceans is close to that expected from the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausius–Clapeyron} relation (about 7% per degree Celsius) with invariant {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity} ({'Figure_2_31 Figure 2.31}). Satellite measurements also indicate that the globally averaged upper tropospheric relative humidity has changed little over the period 1979–2010 while the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} has warmed, implying an increase in the mean water vapour mass in the upper troposphere ({cite.2.'Shi_and_Bates_2011}).

Interannual variations in temperature and upper tropospheric water vapour from IR satellite data are consistent with a constant RH behavior at large spatial scales ({cite.2.'Dessler_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Gettelman_and_Fu_2008}; {cite.2.'Chung_et_al_2010}). On decadal time-scales, increased GHG concentrations reduce clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiation ({cite.2.'Allan_2009}; {cite.2.'Chung_and_Soden_2010}), thereby influencing inferred relationships between moisture and temperature. Using Meteosat IR radiances, {cite.2.'Brogniez_et_al_2009 Brogniez et al. (2009)} demonstrated that interannual variations in free tropospheric humidity over subtropical dry regions are heavily influenced by meridional mixing between the deep tropics and the extra tropics. Regionally, upper tropospheric humidity changes in the tropics were shown to relate strongly to the movement of the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} based upon microwave satellite data ({cite.2.'Xavier_et_al_2010}). {cite.2.'Shi_and_Bates_2011 Shi and Bates (2011)} found an increase in upper tropospheric humidity over the equatorial tropics from 1979 to 2008. However there was no significant {Glossary.*Trend trend} found in tropical-mean or global-mean averages, indicating that on these time and space scales the upper troposphere has seen little change in relative humidity over the past 30 years. While microwave satellite measurements have become increasingly relied upon for studies of upper tropospheric humidity, the absence of a homogenized data set across multiple satellite platforms presents some difficulty in documenting coherent trends from these records ({cite.2.'John_et_al_2011}).
