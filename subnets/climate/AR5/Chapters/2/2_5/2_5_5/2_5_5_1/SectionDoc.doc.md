title: 2.5.5.1 - Radiosonde

Radiosonde humidity data for the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} were used sparingly in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, noting a renewed appreciation for biases with the operational radiosonde data that had been highlighted by several major field campaigns and intercomparisons. Since AR4 there have been three distinct efforts to homogenize the tropospheric humidity records from operational radiosonde measurements ({cite.2.'Durre_et_al_2009}; {cite.2.'McCarthy_et_al_2009}; {cite.2.'Dai_et_al_2011}) (Supplementary Material 2.SM.6.1, Table 2.SM.9). Over the common period of record from 1973 onwards, the resulting estimates are in substantive agreement regarding {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} trends at the largest geographical scales. On average, the impact of the correction procedures is to remove an artificial temporal {Glossary.*Trend trend} towards drying in the raw data and indicate a positive trend in free tropospheric specific humidity over the period of record. In each analysis, the rate of increase in the free troposphere is concluded to be largely consistent with that expected from the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron} relation (about 7% per degree Celsius). There is no evidence for a significant change in free tropospheric {Glossary.*Relative_humidity relative humidity}, although a decrease in relative humidity at lower levels is observed ({Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_5 Section 2.5.5}). Indeed, {cite.2.'McCarthy_et_al_2009 McCarthy et al. (2009)} show close agreement between their radiosonde product at the lowest levels and HadCRUH ({cite.2.'Willett_et_al_2008}).
