title: 2.5.5 - Tropospheric Humidity

As reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, observations from radiosonde and GPS measurements over land, and satellite measurements over ocean indicate increases in tropospheric water vapour at near-global spatial scales which are consistent with the observed increase in atmospheric temperature over the last several decades. Tropospheric water vapour plays an important role in regulating the {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} of the surface and TOA, provides a key {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} mechanism and is essential to the formation of clouds and precipitation.
