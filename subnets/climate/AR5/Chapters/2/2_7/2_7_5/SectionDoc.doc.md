title: 2.7.5 - Tropical Circulation

In {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, large interannual variability of the Hadley and Walker circulation was highlighted, as well as the difficulty in addressing changes in these features in the light of discrepancies between data sets. AR4 also found that rainfall in many monsoon systems exhibits decadal changes, but that data {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} restrict confidence in trends. SREX also {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} low confidence to observed trends in monsoons.

Observational evidence for trends and variability in the strength of the Hadley and Walker circulations (Annex III: Glossary), the monsoons, and the width of the tropical belt is based on radiosonde and reanalyses data ({Box_2_3 Box 2.3}). In addition, changes in the tropical circulation imprint on other fields that are observed from space (e.g., total {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}, outgoing {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation}). Changes in the average state of the tropical circulation are constrained to some extent by changes in the {Glossary.*Water_cycle water cycle} ({cite.2.'Held_and_Soden_2006}; {cite.2.'Schneider_et_al_2010}). Changes in the monsoon systems are expressed through altered circulation, moisture transport and convergence, and precipitation. Only a few monsoon studies address circulation changes, while most work focuses on precipitation.

Several studies report a weakening of the global monsoon circulations as well as a decrease of global land monsoon rainfall or of the number of precipitation days over the past 40 to 50 years ({cite.2.'Zhou_et_al_2008}, see also SREX; {cite.2.'Liu_et_al_2011}). Concerning the East Asian {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon}, a year-round decrease is reported for wind speeds over China at the surface and in the lower {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} based on surface observations and radiosonde data ({cite.2.'Guo_et_al_2010}; {cite.2.'Jiang_et_al_2010}; {cite.2.'Vautard_et_al_2010}; {cite.2.'Xu_et_al_2010}). The changes in wind speed are concomitant with changes in pressure centres such as a westward extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High ({cite.2.'Gong_and_Ho_2002}; {cite.2.'Zhou_et_al_2009b}). A weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon since the

1920s is also found in SLP gradients ({cite.2.'Zhou_et_al_2009a}). However, trends derived from wind observations and circulation trends from {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis data} carry large uncertainties ({'Figure_2_38 Figure 2.38}), and monsoon rainfall trends depend, for example, on the definition of the monsoon area ({cite.2.'Hsu_et_al_2011}). For instance, using a new definition of monsoon area, an increase in northern hemispheric and global summer monsoon (land and ocean) precipitation is reported from 1979 to 2008 ({cite.2.'Hsu_et_al_2011}; {cite.2.'Wang_et_al_2012a}).

The additional data sets that became available since AR4 confirm the large interannual variability of the Hadley and Walker circulation. The strength of the northern Hadley circulation ({'Figure_2_39 Figure 2.39}) in boreal winter and of the Pacific Walker circulation in boreal fall and winter is largely related to the {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}). This association dominates interannual variability and affects trends. Data sets do not agree well with respect to trends in the Hadley circulation ({'Figure_2_39 Figure 2.39}). Two widely used reanalysis data sets, NNR and ERA-40, both have demonstrated shortcomings with respect to tropical circulation; hence their increases in the Hadley circulation strength since the 1970s might be artificial ({cite.2.'Mitas_and_Clement_2005}; {cite.2.'Song_and_Zhang_2007}; {cite.2.'Hu_et_al_2011}; {cite.2.'Stachnik_and_Schumacher_2011}). Later generation reanalysis data sets including ERA-Interim (Brönnimann et al., 2009; {cite.2.'Nguyen_et_al_2013}) as well as satellite humidity data ({cite.2.'Sohn_and_Park_2010}) also suggest a strengthening from the mid 1970s to present, but the magnitude is strongly data set dependent.

Consistent changes in different observed variables suggest a weakening of the Pacific Walker circulation during much of the 20th century that has been largely offset by a recent strengthening. A weakening is indicated by trends in the zonal SLP gradient across the equatorial Pacific ({Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_1 Section 2.7.1}, {'Table_2_14 Table 2.14}) from 1861 to 1992 ({cite.2.'Vecchi_et_al_2006}), or from 1901 to 2004 ({cite.2.'Power_and_Kociuba_2011b}). Boreal spring and summer contribute most strongly to the centennial {Glossary.*Trend trend} ({cite.2.'Nicholls_2008}; {cite.2.'Karnauskas_et_al_2009}), as well as to the trend in the second half of the 20th century ({cite.2.'Tokinaga_et_al_2012}). For boreal fall and winter, when the circulation is strongest, no trend is found in the Pacific Walker circulation based on the vertical velocity at 500 hPa from reanalyses ({cite.2.'Compo_et_al_2011}), equatorial Pacific 10 m zonal winds, or SLP in Darwin ({cite.2.'Nicholls_2008}; {'Figure_2_39 Figure 2.39}). However, there are inconsistencies between ERA-40 and NNR ({cite.2.'Chen_et_al_2008}). {cite.2.'Deser_et_al_2010a Deser et al. (2010a)} find changes in marine air temperature and cloud cover over the Pacific that are consistent with a weakening of the Walker circulation during most of the 20th century (Section 2.5.7.1 and {cite.2.'Yu_and_Zwiers_2010}). {cite.2.'Tokinaga_et_al_2012 Tokinaga et al. (2012)} find robust evidence for a weakening of the Walker circulation (most notably over the Indian Ocean) from 1950 to 2008 based on observations of cloud cover, surface wind, and SLP. Since the 1980s or 1990s, however, trends in the Pacific Walker circulation have reversed ({'Figure_2_39 Figure 2.39}; {cite.2.'Luo_et_al_2012}). This is evident from changes in SLP (see equatorial {Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} Index (SOI) trends in {'Table_2_14 Table 2.14} and {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}, {'Box_2_5_Figure_1 Figure 1}), vertical velocity ({cite.2.'Compo_et_al_2011}), water vapour flux from satellite and reanalysis data ({cite.2.'Sohn_and_Park_2010}), or {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} height ({cite.2.'Merrifield_2011}). It is also consistent with the {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} trend pattern since 1979 ({cite.2.'Meng_et_al_2012}; see also {'Figure_2_22 Figure 2.22}).

{table:'Table_2_14}

Observed changes in several atmospheric parameters suggest that the width of the tropical belt has increased at least since 1979 ({cite.2.'Seidel_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Forster_et_al_2011}; {cite.2.'Hu_et_al_2011}). Since AR4, wind, temperature, radiation, and ozone information from radiosondes, satellites, and reanalyses had been used to diagnose the tropical belt width and estimate their trends. Annual mean time series of the tropical belt width from various sources are shown in {'Figure_2_40 Figure 2.40}.

{image:'Figure_2_40}

Since 1979 the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of low column ozone values typical of the tropics has expanded in the NH ({cite.2.'Hudson_et_al_2006}; {cite.2.'Hudson_2012}). Based on radiosonde observations and reanalyses, the region of the high tropical {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} has expanded since 1979, and possibly since 1960 ({cite.2.'Seidel_and_Randel_2007}; {cite.2.'Birner_2010}; {cite.2.'Lucas_et_al_2012}), although widening estimates from different reanalyses and using different methodologies show a range of magnitudes ({cite.2.'Seidel_and_Randel_2007}; {cite.2.'Birner_2010}).

Several lines of evidence indicate that climate features at the edges of the Hadley cell have also moved poleward since 1979. Subtropical jet metrics from reanalysis zonal winds ({cite.2.'Strong_and_Davis_2007}, 2008; {cite.2.'Archer_and_Caldeira_2008b}, 2008a) and layer-average satellite temperatures ({cite.2.'Fu_et_al_2006}; {cite.2.'Fu_and_Lin_2011}) also indicate widening, although 1979–2009 wind-based trends ({cite.2.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2011}) are not statistically significant. Changes in subtropical {Glossary.*Outgoing_longwave_radiation outgoing longwave radiation}, a surrogate for high cloud, also suggest widening ({cite.2.'Hu_and_Fu_2007}), but the methodology and results are disputed ({cite.2.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2011}). Widening of the tropical belt is also found in precipitation patterns ({cite.2.'Hu_and_Fu_2007}; {cite.2.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2011}; {cite.2.'Hu_et_al_2011}; {cite.2.'Kang_et_al_2011}; {cite.2.'Zhou_et_al_2011}), including in SH regions ({cite.2.'Cai_et_al_2012}).

The qualitative consistency of these observed changes in independent data sets suggests a widening of the tropical belt between at least 1979 and 2005 ({cite.2.'Seidel_et_al_2008}), and possibly longer. Widening estimates range between around 0° and 3° latitude per decade, but their uncertainties have been only partially explored ({cite.2.'Birner_2010}; {cite.2.'Davis_and_Rosenlof_2011}).

In summary, large interannual-to-decadal variability is found in the strength of the Hadley and Walker circulation. The confidence in trends in the strength of the Hadley circulation is low due to uncertainties in reanalysis data sets. Recent strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation has largely offset the weakening trend from the 19th century to the 1990s (high confidence). Several lines of independent evidence indicate a widening of the tropical belt since the 1970s. The suggested weakening of the East Asian monsoon has low confidence, given the nature and quality of the evidence.
