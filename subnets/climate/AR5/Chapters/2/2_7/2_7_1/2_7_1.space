  |{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that Sea Level Pressure (SLP) in December to February decreased between 1948 and 2005 in the Arctic, Antarctic and North Pacific. More recent studies corroborated this finding. SLP has likely decreased from 1979 to 2012 over the tropical Atlantic and increased over large regions of the Pacific and South Atlantic.
