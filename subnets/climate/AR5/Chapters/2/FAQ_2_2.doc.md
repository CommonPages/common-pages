title: FAQ 2.2 - Have There Been Any Changes in Climate Extremes?

There is strong evidence that warming has lead to changes in temperature extremes—including heat waves—since the mid-20th century. Increases in heavy precipitation have probably also occurred over this time, but vary by {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}. However, for other extremes, such as tropical cyclone frequency, we are less certain, except in some limited regions, that there have been discernable changes over the observed record.

From heat waves to cold snaps or droughts to flooding rains, recording and analysing climate extremes poses unique challenges, not just because these events are rare, but also because they invariably happen in conjunction with disruptive conditions. Furthermore, there is no consistent definition in the scientific literature of what constitutes an extreme climatic event, and this complicates comparative global assessments.

Although, in an absolute sense, an {Glossary.*Extreme_climate_event extreme climate event} will vary from place to place—a hot day in the tropics, for instance, may be a different temperature to a hot day in the mid-latitudes—international efforts to monitor extremes have highlighted some significant global changes.

For example, using consistent definitions for cold (<10th percentile) and warm (>90th percentile) days and nights it is found that warm days and nights have increased and {Topics.*Extreme_Events cold days and nights} have decreased for most regions of the globe; a few exceptions being central and eastern North America, and southern South America but mostly only related to daytime temperatures. Those changes are generally most apparent in minimum temperature extremes, for example, warm nights. Data limitations make it difficult to establish a causal link to increases in average temperatures, but {FAQ_2_2 FAQ 2.2}, {'FAQ_2_2_Figure_1 Figure 1} indicates that daily global temperature extremes have indeed changed. Whether these changes are simply associated with the average of daily temperatures increasing (the dashed lines in {FAQ_2_2 FAQ 2.2}, {'FAQ_2_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}) or whether other changes in the distribution of daytime and nighttime temperatures have occurred is still under debate.

Warm spells or heat waves, that is, periods containing consecutive extremely hot days or nights, have also been assessed, but there are fewer studies of {Glossary.*Heat_wave heat wave} characteristics than those that compare changes in merely warm days or nights. Most global land areas with available data have experienced more heat waves since the middle of the 20th century. One exception is the south-eastern USA, where heat wave frequency and duration measures generally show decreases. This has been associated with a so-called ‘warming hole’ in this region, where precipitation has also increased and may be related to interactions between the land and the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} and long-term variations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, for large regions, particularly in Africa and South America, information on changes in heatwaves is limited.

For regions such as Europe, where historical temperature reconstructions exist going back several hundreds of years, indications are that some areas have experienced a disproportionate number of extreme heat waves in recent decades.
