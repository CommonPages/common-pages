title: 2.4.2.1.1 - In situ data records

Historically, most {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} observations were obtained from moving ships. Buoy measurements comprise a significant and increasing fraction of in situ SST measurements from the 1980s onward ({'Figure_2_15 Figure 2.15}). Improvements in the understanding of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} have been expedited by the use of {Glossary.*Metadata metadata} ({cite.2.'Kent_et_al_2007}) and the recovery of observer instructions and other related documents. Early data were systematically cold biased because they were made using canvas or wooden buckets that, on average, lost heat to the air before the measurements were taken. This effect has long been recognized ({cite.2.'Brooks_1926}), and prior to {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} represented the only artefact adjusted in gridded SST products, such as HadSST2 ({cite.2.'Rayner_et_al_2006}) and ERSST ({cite.2.'Smith_et_al_2005}, 2008), which were based on ‘bucket correction’ methods by {cite.2.'Folland_and_Parker_1995 Folland and Parker (1995)} and {cite.2.'Smith_and_Reynolds_2002 Smith and Reynolds (2002)}, respectively. The adjustments, made using ship observations of Night Marine Air Temperature (NMAT) and other sources, had a striking effect on the SST global mean estimates: note the difference in 1850–1941 between HadSST2 and International Comprehensive Ocean-{Topics.*Climate_System Atmosphere} Data Set (ICOADS) curves in {'Figure_2_16 Figure 2.16} (a brief description of SST and NMAT data sets and their methods is given in Supplementary Material 2.SM.4.3).

Buckets of improved design and measurement methods with smaller, on average, biases came into use after 1941 ({'Figure_2_15 Figure 2.15}, top); average biases were reduced further in recent decades, but not eliminated ({'Figure_2_15 Figure 2.15}, bottom). Increasing density of SST observations made possible the identification ({cite.2.'Reynolds_et_al_2002}, 2010; {cite.2.'Kennedy_et_al_2012}) and partial correction of more recent period biases ({cite.2.'Kennedy_et_al_2011a}). In particular, it is hypothesized that the proximity of the hot engine often biases engine room intake (ERI) measurements warm ({cite.2.'Kent_et_al_2010}). Because of the prevalence of the ERI measurements among SST data from ships, the ship SSTs are biased warm by 0.12°C to 0.18°C on average compared to the buoy data ({cite.2.'Reynolds_et_al_2010}; {cite.2.'Kennedy_et_al_2011a}, 2012). An assessment of the potential impact of modern biases can be ascertained by considering the difference between HadSST3 (bias corrections applied throughout) and HadSST2 (bucket corrections only) global means ({'Figure_2_16 Figure 2.16}): it is particularly prominent in 1945–1970 period, when rapid changes in prevalence of ERI and bucket measurements during and after the World War II affect HadSST2 owing to the uncorrected measurement biases ({cite.2.'Thompson_et_al_2008}), while these are corrected in HadSST3. Nevertheless, for periods longer than a century the effect of HadSST3-HadSST2 differences on linear {Glossary.*Trend trend} slopes is small relative to the trend uncertainty ({'Table_2_5 Table 2.5}). Some degree of independent check on the validity of HadSST3 adjustments comes from a comparison to sub-{Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} data ({cite.2.'Gouretski_et_al_2012}) (see {Chapters.3.3_2 Section 3.2}).

The traditional approach to modeling random error of in situ SST data assumed the independence of individual measurements. {cite.2.'Kent_and_Berry_2008 Kent and Berry (2008)} identified the need to account for error correlation for measurements from the same “platform” (i.e., an individual ship or buoy), while measurement errors from different platforms remain independent.. {cite.2.'Kennedy_et_al_2011b Kennedy et al. (2011b)} achieved that by introducing platform-dependent biases, which are constant within the same platform, but change randomly from one platform to another. Accounting for such correlated errors in HadSST3 resulted in estimated error for global and hemispheric monthly means that are more than twice the estimates given by HadSST2. The uncertainty in many, but not all, components of the HadSST3 product is represented by the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} of its realizations ({'Figure_2_17 Figure 2.17}).

Data sets of marine air temperatures (MATs) have traditionally been restricted to nighttime series only (NMAT data sets) due to the direct solar heating effect on the daytime measurements, although corrected daytime MAT records for 1973–present are already available ({cite.2.'Berry_and_Kent_2009}). Other major biases, affecting both nighttime and daytime MAT are due to increasing deck height with the general increase in the size of ships over time and non-standard measurement practices. Recently these biases were re-examined and explicit uncertainty calculation undertaken for NMAT by {cite.2.'Kent_et_al_2013 Kent et al. (2013)}, resulting in the HadNMAT2 data set.
