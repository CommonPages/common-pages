title: 2.4.2 - Sea Surface Temperature and Marine Air Temperature

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} concluded that ‘recent’ warming (since the 1950s) is strongly evident at all latitudes in {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} over each ocean. Prominent spatio-temporal structures including the {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and decadal variability patterns in the Pacific Ocean ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}) and a hemispheric asymmetry in the Atlantic Ocean were highlighted as contributors to the regional differences in surface warming rates, which in turn affect atmospheric circulation. Since AR4 the availability of {Glossary.*Metadata metadata} has increased, data completeness has improved and a number of new SST products have been produced. Intercomparisons of data obtained by different measurement methods, including satellite data, have resulted in better understanding of errors and biases in the record.
