title: 2.4.2.2 - Interpolated SST Products and Trends

{Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} data sets form a major part of global {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} analyses considered in this assessment report. To use an SST data set as a boundary condition for atmospheric reanalyses products ({Box_2_3 Box 2.3}) or in {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}-only climate simulations (considered in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9} onwards), gridded data sets with complete coverage over the global ocean are typically needed. These are usually based on a special form of kriging (optimal interpolation) procedure that retains large-scale correlation structures and can accommodate very sparse data coverage. For the pre-satellite era (generally, before October 1981) only in situ data are used; for the latter period some products also use AVHRR data. {'Figure_2_18 Figure 2.18} compares interpolated SST data sets that extend back to the 19th century with the uninterpolated HadSST3 and HadNMAT2 products. Linear {Glossary.*Trend trend} estimates for global mean SSTs from those products updated through 2012 are presented in {'Table_2_6 Table 2.6}. Differences between the trends from different data sets are larger when the calculation period is shorter (1979–2012) or has lower quality data (1901–1950); these are due mainly to different data coverage of underlying observational data sets and bias correction methods used in these products.

In summary, it is certain that global average sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} (SSTs) have increased since the beginning of the 20th century. Since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, major improvements in availability of {Glossary.*Metadata metadata} and data completeness have been made, and a number of new global SST records have been produced. Intercomparisons of new SST data records obtained by different measurement methods, including satellite data, have resulted in better understanding of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} and biases in the records. Although these innovations have helped highlight and quantify uncertainties and affect our understanding of the character of changes since the mid-20th century, they do not alter the conclusion that global SSTs have increased both since the 1950s and since the late 19th century.
