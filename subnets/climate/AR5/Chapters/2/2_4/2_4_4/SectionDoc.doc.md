title: 2.4.4 - Upper Air Temperature

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} summarized that globally the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} had warmed at a rate greater than the {Topics.*Surface_Temperature GMST} over the radiosonde record, while over the shorter satellite era the GMST and tropospheric warming rates were indistinguishable. Trends in the tropics were more uncertain than global trends although even this {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} was concluded to be warming. Globally, the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} was reported to be cooling over the satellite era starting in 1979. New advances since AR4 have highlighted the substantial degree of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in both satellite and balloon-borne radiosonde records and led to some revisions and improvements in existing products and the creation of a number of new data products.
