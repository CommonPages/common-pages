title: 2.4.4.4 - Synthesis of Free Atmosphere Temperature Estimates

Global-mean lower tropospheric temperatures have increased since the mid-20th century ({'Figure_2_24 Figure 2.24}, bottom). Structural {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({Box_2_1 Box 2.1}) are larger than at the surface but it can still be concluded that globally the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} has warmed ({'Table_2_8 Table 2.8}). On top of this long-term {Glossary.*Trend trend} are superimposed short-term variations that are highly correlated with those at the surface but of somewhat greater amplitude. Global mean lower stratospheric temperatures have decreased since the mid20th century punctuated by short-lived warming events associated with explosive volcanic activity ({'Figure_2_24 Figure 2.24}a). However, since the mid-1990s little net change has occurred. Cooling rates are on average greater from radiosonde data sets than {Glossary.*Microwave_Sounding_Unit MSU} data sets. This very likely relates to widely recognized cooling biases in radiosondes ({cite.2.'Mears_et_al_2006}) which all data set producers explicitly caution are likely to remain to some extent in their final products ({cite.2.'Free_and_Seidel_2007}; {cite.2.'Haimberger_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Sherwood_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Thorne_et_al_2011}).

In comparison to the surface ({'Figure_2_22 Figure 2.22}), tropospheric layers exhibit smoother geographic trends ({'Figure_2_25 Figure 2.25}) with warming dominating cooling north of approximately 45°S and greatest warming in high northern latitudes. The lower {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} cooled almost everywhere but this cooling exhibits substantial large-scale structure. Cooling is greatest in the highest southern latitudes and smallest in high northern latitudes. There are also secondary stratospheric cooling maxima in the mid-latitude regions of each hemisphere.

Available global and regional trends from radiosondes since 1958 ({'Figure_2_26 Figure 2.26}) show agreement that the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere cooled. While there is little ambiguity in the sign of the changes, the rate and vertical structure of change are distinctly data set dependent, particularly in the stratosphere. Differences are greatest in the tropics and SH extra-tropics where the historical radiosonde data coverage is poorest. Not shown in the figure for clarity are estimates of parametric data set uncertainties or trend-fit uncertainties—both of which are of the order of at least 0.1°C per decade ({Chapters.2.2_4.2_4_4.2_4_4_1 Section 2.4.4.1}).

Differences in trends between available radiosonde data sets are greater during the satellite era than for the full radiosonde period of record in all regions and at most levels ({'Figure_2_27 Figure 2.27}; cf. {'Figure_2_26 Figure 2.26}). The RAOBCORE product exhibits greater vertical trend gradients than other data sets and it has been posited that this relates to its dependency on {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} fields ({cite.2.'Sakamoto_and_Christy_2009}; {cite.2.'Christy_et_al_2010}). MSU trend estimates in the troposphere are generally bracketed by the radiosonde range. In the stratosphere MSU deep layer estimates tend to show slightly less cooling. Over both 1958–2011 and 1979–2011 there is some evidence in the radiosonde products taken as a whole that the tropical tropospheric trends increase with height. But the magnitude and the structure is highly data set dependent.

In summary, based on multiple independent analyses of measurements from radiosondes and satellite sensors it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. Despite unanimous agreement on the sign of the trends, substantial disagreement exists among available estimates as to the rate of temperature changes, particularly outside the NH extratropical troposphere, which has been well sampled by radiosondes. Hence there is only medium confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure in the NH extratropical troposphere and low confidence elsewhere.
