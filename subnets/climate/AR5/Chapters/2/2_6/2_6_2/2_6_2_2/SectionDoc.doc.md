{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} WGI {Chapters.3 Chapter 3} ({cite.2.'Trenberth_et_al_2007}) did not assess changes in floods but AR4 WGII concluded that there was not a general global {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the incidence of floods ({cite.2.'Kundzewicz_et_al_2007}). SREX went further to suggest that there was low agreement and thus low confidence at the global scale regarding changes in the magnitude or frequency of floods or even the sign of changes.

AR5 WGII assesses floods in regional detail accounting for the fact that trends in floods are strongly influenced by changes in river management (see also {Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_2 Section 2.5.2}). Although the most evident flood trends appear to be in northern high latitudes, where observed warming trends have been largest, in some regions no evidence of a trend in extreme flooding has been found, for example, over Russia based on daily {Glossary.*River_discharge river discharge} ({cite.2.'Shiklomanov_et_al_2007}). Other studies for Europe ({cite.2.'Hannaford_and_Marsh_2008}; {cite.2.'Renard_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Petrow_and_Merz_2009}; {cite.2.'Stahl_et_al_2010}) and Asia ({cite.2.'Jiang_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Delgado_et_al_2010}) show evidence for upward, downward or no trend in the magnitude and frequency of floods, so that there is currently no clear and widespread evidence for observed changes in flooding except for the earlier spring flow in snow-dominated regions ({cite.2.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}).

In summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale.
