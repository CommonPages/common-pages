title: 2.6 - Changes in Extreme Events

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} highlighted the importance of understanding changes in {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme climate events} (Annex III: Glossary) because of their disproportionate impact on society and ecosystems compared to changes in mean climate (see also IPCC Working Group II). More recently a comprehensive assessment of observed changes in extreme events was undertaken by the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) ({cite.2.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}; {Chapters.1.1_3.1_3_3 Section 1.3.3}).

Data availability, quality and consistency especially affect the statistics of extremes and some variables are particularly sensitive to changing measurement practices over time. For example, historical tropical cyclone records are known to be heterogeneous owing to changing observing technology and reporting protocols ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 Section 14.6.1}) and when records from multiple ocean basins are combined to explore global trends, because data quality and reporting protocols vary substantially between regions ({cite.2.'Knapp_and_Kruk_2010}). Similar problems have been discovered when analysing wind extremes, because of the sensitivity of measurements to changing instrumentation and observing practice (e.g., {cite.2.'Smits_et_al_2005}; {cite.2.'Wan_et_al_2010}).

Numerous regional studies indicate that changes observed in the frequency of extremes can be explained or inferred by shifts in the overall probability distribution of the climate variable ({cite.2.'Griffiths_et_al_2005}; {cite.2.'Ballester_et_al_2010}; {cite.2.'Simolo_et_al_2011}). However, it should be noted that these studies refer to counts of threshold exceedance— frequency, duration—which closely follow mean changes. Departures from high {Glossary.*Percentiles percentiles}/return periods (intensity, severity, magnitude) are highly sensitive to changes in the shape and scale parameters of the distribution (Schär et al., 2004; {cite.2.'Clark_et_al_2006}; Della-Marta et al., 2007a, 2007b; Fischer and Schär, 2010) and geographical location. Debate continues over whether variance as well as mean changes are affecting global temperature extremes ({cite.2.'Hansen_et_al_2012}; {cite.2.'Rhines_and_Huybers_2013}) as illustrated in {'Figure_1_8 Figure 1.8} and {FAQ_2_2 FAQ 2.2}, {'FAQ_2_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}. In the following sections the conclusions from both AR4 and SREX are reviewed along with studies subsequent to those assessments.
