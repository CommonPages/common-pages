title: 2.6.4 - Extratropical Storms

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} noted a likely net increase in frequency/intensity of NH extreme extratropical cyclones and a poleward shift in {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} since the 1950s. SREX further consolidated the AR4 assessment of poleward shifting storm tracks, but revised the assessment of the confidence levels associated with regional trends in the intensity of extreme extratropical cyclones.

Studies using reanalyses continue to support a northward and eastward shift in the Atlantic cyclone activity during the last 60 years with both more frequent and more intense wintertime cyclones in the high-latitude Atlantic ({cite.2.'Schneidereit_et_al_2007}; {cite.2.'Raible_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Vilibic_and_Sepic_2010}) and fewer in the mid-latitude Atlantic ({cite.2.'Wang_et_al_2006b}; {cite.2.'Raible_et_al_2008}). Some studies show an increase in intensity and number of extreme Atlantic cyclones ({cite.2.'Paciorek_et_al_2002}; {cite.2.'Lehmann_et_al_2011}) while others show opposite trends in eastern Pacific and North America ({cite.2.'Gulev_et_al_2001}). Comparisons between studies are hampered because of the sensitivities in identification schemes and/ or different definitions for extreme cyclones ({cite.2.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}; {cite.2.'Neu_et_al_2012}). The fidelity of research findings also rests largely with the underlying reanalyses products that are used ({Box_2_3 Box 2.3}). See also {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}.

Over longer periods studies of severe storms or storminess have been performed for Europe where long running in situ pressure and wind observations exist. Direct wind speed measurements, however, either have short records or are hampered by inconsistencies due to changing instrumentation and observing practice over time ({cite.2.'Smits_et_al_2005}; {cite.2.'Wan_et_al_2010}). In most cases, therefore wind speed or storminess proxies are derived from in situ pressure measurements or reanalyses data, the quality and consistency of which vary. In situ observations indicate no clear trends over the past century or longer ({cite.2.'Hanna_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Matulla_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Allan_et_al_2009}; {cite.2.'Barring_and_Fortuniak_2009}), with substantial decadal and longer fluctuations but with some regional and seasonal trends ({cite.2.'Wang_et_al_2009c}, 2011). {'Figure_2_35 Figure 2.35} shows some of these changes for boreal winter using geostrophic wind speeds indicating that decreasing trends outnumber increasing trends ({cite.2.'Wang_et_al_2011}), although with few that are statistically significant. Although {cite.2.'Donat_et_al_2011 Donat et al. (2011)} and Wang et al. (2012h) find significant increases in both the strength and frequency of wintertime storms for large parts of Europe using the 20CR ({cite.2.'Compo_et_al_2011}), there is debate over whether this is an artefact of the changing number of assimilated observations over time ({cite.2.'Cornes_and_Jones_2011}; {cite.2.'Krueger_et_al_2013}) even though Wang et al. (2012h) find good agreement between the 20CR trends and those derived from geostropic wind extremes in the North Sea {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}.

SREX noted that available studies using reanalyses indicate a decrease in {Glossary.*Extratropical_cyclone extratropical cyclone} activity ({cite.2.'Zhang_et_al_2004}) and intensity ({cite.2.'Zhang_et_al_2004}; Wang et al., 2009d) over the last 50 years has been reported for northern Eurasia (60°N to 40°N) linked to a possible northward shift with increased cyclone frequency in the higher latitudes and decrease in the lower latitudes. The decrease at lower latitudes was also found in East Asia (Wang et al., 2012h) and is also supported by a study of severe storms by {cite.2.'Zou_et_al_2006b Zou et al. (2006b)} who used sub-daily in situ pressure data from a number of stations across China.

SREX also notes that, based on reanalyses, North American cyclone numbers have increased over the last 50 years, with no statistically significant change in cyclone intensity ({cite.2.'Zhang_et_al_2004}). Hourly SLP data from Canadian stations showed that winter cyclones have become significantly more frequent, longer lasting, and stronger in the lower Canadian Arctic over the last 50 years (1953–2002), but less frequent and weaker in the south, especially along the southeast and southwest Canadian coasts ({cite.2.'Wang_et_al_2006a}). Further south, a tendency toward weaker low-pressure systems over the past few decades was found for U.S. east coast winter cyclones using reanalyses, but no statistically significant trends in the frequency of occurrence of systems ({cite.2.'Hirsch_et_al_2001}).

Using the 20CR ({cite.2.'Compo_et_al_2011}), Wang et al. (2012h) found substantial increases in extratropical cyclone activity in the SH (20°S to 90°S). However, for southeast Australia, a decrease in activity is found and this agrees well with geostrophic wind extremes derived from in situ surface pressure observations ({cite.2.'Alexander_et_al_2011}). This strengthens the evidence of a southward shift in storm tracks previously noted using older reanalyses products ({cite.2.'Fyfe_2003}; {cite.2.'Hope_et_al_2006}). {cite.2.'Frederiksen_and_Frederiksen_2007 Frederiksen and Frederiksen (2007)} linked the reduction in cyclogenesis at 30°S and southward shift to a decrease in the vertical mean meridional temperature gradient. There is some inconsistency among reanalysis products for the SH regarding trends in the frequency of intense extratropical cyclones ({cite.2.'Lim_and_Simmonds_2007}; {cite.2.'Pezza_et_al_2007}; {cite.2.'Lim_and_Simmonds_2009}) although studies tend to agree on a {Glossary.*Trend trend} towards more intense systems, even when inhomogeneities associated with changing numbers of observations have been taken into account (Wang et al., 2012h). However, further undetected contamination of these trends owing to issues with the reanalyses products cannot be ruled out ({Box_2_3 Box 2.3}) and this lowers our confidence in long-term trends. Links between extratropical cyclone activity and large-scale variability are discussed in Sections {Chapters.2.2_7 2.7} and {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 14.6.2}.

Studies that have examined trends in wind extremes from observations or regional reanalysis products tend to point to declining trends in extremes in mid-latitudes ({cite.2.'Pirazzoli_and_Tomasin_2003}; {cite.2.'Smits_et_al_2005}; {cite.2.'Pryor_et_al_2007}; {cite.2.'Zhang_et_al_2007b}) and increasing trends in high latitudes ({cite.2.'Lynch_et_al_2004}; {cite.2.'Turner_et_al_2005}; {cite.2.'Hundecha_et_al_2008}; {cite.2.'Stegall_and_Zhang_2012}). Other studies have compared the trends from observations with {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis data} and reported differing or even opposite trends in the reanalysis products ({cite.2.'Smits_et_al_2005}; {cite.2.'McVicar_et_al_2008}). On the other hand, declining trends reported by {cite.2.'Xu_et_al_2006b Xu et al. (2006b)} over China between 1969 and 2000 were generally consistent with trends in NCEP reanalysis. Trends extracted from reanalysis products must be treated with caution however, although usually with later generation products providing improvements over older products ({Box_2_3 Box 2.3}).

In summary, confidence in large scale changes in the intensity of extreme extratropical cyclones since 1900 is low. There is also low confidence for a clear trend in storminess proxies over the last century due to inconsistencies between studies or lack of long-term data in some parts of the world (particularly in the SH). Likewise, confidence in trends in extreme winds is low, owing to quality and consistency issues with analysed data.
