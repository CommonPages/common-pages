section 8_1_1

  |Radiative Forcing (RF) is the net change in the {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} due to some imposed perturbation. It is usually expressed in watts per square meter (W mâ€“2) and quantifies the energy imbalance that occurs when the imposed change takes place. RF provides a simple quantitative basis for comparing the potential {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} to different imposed agents. Alternative definitions of RF have been developed. We term a forcing that accounts for rapid adjustments the effective {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF}).
