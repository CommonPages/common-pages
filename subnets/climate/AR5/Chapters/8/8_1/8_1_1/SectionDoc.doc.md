title: 8.1.1 - The Radiative Forcing Concept

{Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} is the net change in the {Glossary.*Energy_balance energy balance} of the {Topics.*Climate_System Earth system} due to some imposed perturbation. It is usually expressed in watts per square meter averaged over a particular period of time and quantifies the energy imbalance that occurs when the imposed change takes place. Though usually difficult to observe, calculated RF provides a simple quantitative basis for comparing some aspects of the potential {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} to different imposed agents, especially {Topics.*Surface_Temperature global mean temperature}, and hence is widely used in the scientific community. Forcing is often presented as the value due to changes between two particular times, such as pre-industrial to present-day, while its time evolution provides a more complete picture.
