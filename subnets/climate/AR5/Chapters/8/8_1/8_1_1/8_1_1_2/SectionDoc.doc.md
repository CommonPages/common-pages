title: 8.1.1.2 - Defining Effective Radiative Forcing

For many forcing agents the RF gives a very useful and appropriate way to compare the relative importance of their potential climate effect. Instantaneous RF or RF is not an accurate indicator of the temperature response for all forcing agents, however. Rapid adjustments in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} can either enhance or reduce the flux perturbations, leading to substantial differences in the forcing driving long-term climate change. In much the same way that allowing for the relatively {Glossary.*Rapid_adjustment rapid adjustment} of stratospheric temperatures provides a more useful characterization of the forcing due to stratospheric constituent changes, inclusion of rapid tropospheric adjustments has the potential to provide more useful characterization for drivers in the troposphere (see also {Chapters.7.7_1.7_1_3 Section 7.1.3}).

Many of the rapid adjustments affect clouds and are not readily included into the RF concept. For example, for aerosols, especially absorbing ones, changes in the temperature distribution above the surface occur due to a variety of effects, including cloud response to changing atmospheric stability ({cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}; see {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_4.7_3_4_2 Section 7.3.4.2}) and cloud absorption effects ({cite.8.'Jacobson_2012}), which affect fluxes but are not strictly part of RF. Similar adjustments take place for many forcings, including {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_6 Section 7.2.5.6}).

Aerosols also alter cloud properties via microphysical interactions leading to indirect forcings (referred to as {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions; see {Chapters.7.7_4 Section 7.4}). Although these adjustments are complex and not fully quantified, they occur both on the microphysical scale of the cloud particles as well as on a more macroscopic scale involving whole cloud systems (e.g., {cite.8.'Shine_et_al_2003}; {cite.8.'Penner_et_al_2006}; {cite.8.'Quaas_et_al_2009}). A portion of these adjustments occurs over a short period, on cloud life cycle time scales, and is not part of a {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} arising from the {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} changes. Previously these type of adjustments were sometimes termed ‘fast feedbacks’ (e.g., {cite.8.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}), whereas in AR5 they are denoted ‘rapid adjustments’ to emphasize their distinction from feedbacks involving surface temperature changes. Atmospheric chemistry responses have typically been included under the RF framework, and hence could also be included in a forcing encompassing rapid adjustments, which is important when evaluating forcing attributable to {Topics.*Emissions emissions} changes ({Chapters.8.8_1.8_1_2 Section 8.1.2}) and in the calculation of emission metrics ({Chapters.8.8_7 Section 8.7}).

Studies have demonstrated the utility of including rapid adjustment in comparison of forcing agents, especially in allowing quantification of forcing due to aerosol-induced changes in clouds (e.g., effects previously denoted as cloud {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} or semi-direct effects; see {'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}) that are not amenable to characterization by RF (e.g., {cite.8.'Rotstayn_and_Penner_2001}; {cite.8.'Shine_et_al_2003}; {cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Lohmann_et_al_2010}; Ban-Weiss et al., 2012). Several measures of forcing have been introduced that include rapid adjustments. We term a forcing that accounts for rapid adjustments the effective {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF}). Conceptually, ERF represents the change in net TOA downward radiative flux after allowing for atmospheric temperatures, water vapour and clouds to adjust, but with {Glossary.*Global_mean_surface_temperature global mean surface temperature} or a portion of surface conditions unchanged. The primary methods in use for such calculations are (1) fixing sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} (SSTs) and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} cover at climatological values while allowing all other parts of the system to respond until reaching steady state (e.g., {cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}) or (2) analyzing the transient global mean surface temperature response to an instantaneous perturbation and using the regression of the response extrapolated back to the start of the simulation to derive the initial ERF ({cite.8.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.8.'Gregory_and_Webb_2008}). The ERF calculated using the regression technique has an {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of about 10% (for the 5 to 95% confidence interval) for a single 4 × CO2 simulation (ERF ~7 W m–2) due to {Topics.*Climate_Variability internal variability} in the transient climate ({cite.8.'Andrews_et_al_2012a}), while given a similar length simulation the uncertainty due to internal variability in ERF calculated using the fixed-{Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} technique is much smaller and hence the latter may be more suitable for very small forcings. Analysis of both techniques shows that the fixed-SST method yields a smaller spread across models, even in calculations neglecting the uncertainty in the regression fitting procedure ({cite.8.'Andrews_et_al_2012a}). As a portion of land area responses are included in the fixed-SST technique, however, that ERF is slightly less than it would be with surface temperature held fixed everywhere. It is possible to adjust for this in the global mean forcing, though we do not include such a correction here as we examine regional as well as global ERF, but the land response will also introduce artificial gradients in land–sea temperatures that could cause small local climate responses. In contrast, there is no global mean temperature response included in the regression method. Despite the low bias in fixed-SST ERF due to land responses, results from a multi-model analysis of the forcing due to CO2 are 7% greater using this method than using the regression technique ({cite.8.'Andrews_et_al_2012a}) though this is within the uncertainty range of the calculations. Although each technique has advantages, forcing diagnosed using the fixed-SST method is available for many more forcing agents in the current generation of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} than forcing diagnosed using the regression method. Hence for practical purposes, ERF is hereafter used for results from the fixed-SST technique unless otherwise stated (see also {Box_8_1 Box 8.1}).

The conceptual relation between instantaneous RF, RF and ERF is illustrated in {'Figure_8_1 Figure 8.1}. It implies the adjustments to the instantaneous RF involve effects of processes that occur more rapidly than the time scale of the response of the global mean surface temperature to the forcing. However, there is no a priori time scale defined for adjustments to be rapid with the fixed-SST method. The majority take place on time scales of seasons or less, but there is a spectrum of adjustment times. Changes in land ice and snow cover, for instance, may take place over many years. The ERF thus represents that part of the instantaneous RF that is maintained over long time scales and more directly contributes to the steady-state {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}. The RF can be considered a more limited version of ERF. Because the atmospheric temperature has been allowed to adjust, ERF would be nearly identical if calculated at the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} instead of the TOA for tropospheric forcing agents, as would RF. Recent work has noted likely advantages of the ERF framework for understanding model responses to CO2 as well as to more complex forcing agents (see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_5.7_2_5_6 Section 7.2.5.6}).

The {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity climate sensitivity} parameter l derived with respect to RF can vary substantially across different forcing agents ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2007}). The response to RF from a particular agent relative to the response to RF from CO2 has been termed the {Glossary.*Efficacy efficacy} ({cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}). By including many of the rapid adjustments that differ across forcing agents, the ERF concept includes much of their relative efficacy and therefore leads to more uniform climate sensitivity across agents. For example, the influence of clouds on the interaction of aerosols with sunlight and the effect of aerosol heating on cloud formation can lead to very large differences in the response per unit RF from black carbon ({Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}) located at different altitudes, but the response per unit ERF is nearly uniform with altitude ({cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Ming_et_al_2010}; Ban-Weiss et al., 2012). Hence as we use ERF in this chapter when it differs significantly from RF, efficacy is not used hereinafter. For inhomogeneous forcings, we note that the {Glossary.*Climate_sensitivity_parameter climate sensitivity parameter} may also depend on the horizontal forcing distribution, especially with latitude ({cite.8.'Shindell_and_Faluvegi_2009}; {Chapters.8.8_6.8_6_2 Section 8.6.2}).

A combination of RF and ERF will be used in this chapter with RF provided to keep consistency with {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} and {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, and ERF used to allow quantification of more complex forcing agents and, in some cases, provide a more useful {Glossary.*Metric metric} than RF.
