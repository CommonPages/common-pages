title: 8.6 - Geographic Distribution of Radiative Forcing

The {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} spatial pattern of the various RF mechanisms varies substantially in space and in time, especially for the NTCFs. The spatial pattern is of interest to the extent that it may influence {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} ({Chapters.8.8_6.8_6_2.8_6_2_2 Section 8.6.2.2}) as is being particularly investigated in the ACCMIP simulations.
