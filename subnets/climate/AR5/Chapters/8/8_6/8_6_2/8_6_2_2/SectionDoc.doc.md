title: 8.6.2.2 - Relationship Between Regional Forcing Patterns and Climate Response During the Industrial Era

An increasing body of research considers how spatial variations in RF affect {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response}. {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} and attribution methods have had limited success in discerning statistically significant {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} signals from regional forcing, due to large internal {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} at regional scales, uncertainty in model processes and sparse regional observational records ({Chapters.10 Chapter 10}). Meanwhile, research including model sensitivity studies for NTCFs, which vary strongly in space in time, explores climate response patterns.

In {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Knutti_et_al_2008}) it was argued that the spatial pattern of forcing is not indicative of the pattern of climate response. Rather, the response is linked more closely to TOA flux resulting from the climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} spatial patterns ({cite.8.'Boer_and_Yu_2003}; {cite.8.'Taylor_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Ming_and_Ramaswamy_2012}), with the {Glossary.*Lapse_rate lapse rate}, surface albedo and cloud feedbacks explaining most of the temperature response. Yet {cite.8.'Crook_and_Forster_2011 Crook and Forster (2011)} showed that both the spatial distribution of climate feedbacks and of heterogeneous forcing played important roles in the patterns of 20th century temperature changes. Other studies since AR4 have probed relationships between forcing patterns and climate responses.

Broad links between forcing and climate response have been identified. {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2010 Shindell et al. (2010)} used multiple models to show that {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} changes are much more sensitive to latitudinal than longitudinal variations in forcing. {cite.8.'Shindell_and_Faluvegi_2009 Shindell and Faluvegi (2009)} used a model inverse approach to infer that NH {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} reduction was associated with more than 70% of Arctic warming from the 1970s to the 2000s, and that Arctic and much of the SH surface temperature changes are strongly affected by remote forcing changes (also{Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_1.10_3_1_1.10_3_1_1_4 Section 10.3.1.1.4}). {cite.8.'Voulgarakis_and_Shindell_2010 Voulgarakis and Shindell (2010)} defined a regional transient temperature sensitivity parameter, or temperature response per unit forcing for each 4-degree latitude band. Using observed surface air temperature changes they showed that the parameter is best constrained from 50°S to 25°N, where the value is 0.35°C (W m–2)–1, smaller than at northern higher latitudes, and 35% smaller than in AR4 models.

Some aerosol model studies have demonstrated highly localized climate response to regional forcing. Significant regional cooling and hydrological shifts in the eastern USA and in Eastern Asia during the last half of the 20th century were modelled and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to local aerosols ({cite.8.'Leibensperger_et_al_2008}, 2012a, 2012b; {cite.8.'Chang_et_al_2009}) and localized warming {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} for aerosol reductions ({cite.8.'Mickley_et_al_2012}). Observations have also linked historical trends in aerosols and temperature ({cite.8.'Ruckstuhl_et_al_2008}; {cite.8.'Philipona_et_al_2009}).

Since AR4, there has been new research on aerosol influences on the hydrologic cycle (also Sections {Chapters.7.7_4 7.4}, {Chapters.7.7_6.7_6_4 7.6.4}, {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3.10_3_3_1 10.3.3.1} and {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4.11_3_2_4_3 11.3.2.4.3}). Increased aerosol loading, with greater surface energy flux reduction in the NH, has been implicated in the observed southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}) towards the hemisphere with smaller surface energy reduction: southward up to the 1980s with a reversal since (e.g., {cite.8.'Denman_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Zhang_et_al_2007}). Several studies have modelled an associated reduction in NH precipitation and associated shifts in the Hadley circulation (e.g., {cite.8.'Rotstayn_et_al_2000}; {cite.8.'Williams_et_al_2001}; {cite.8.'Ming_et_al_2011}). The ITCZ shift may in turn be responsible for broad regional precipitation changes, including drying of the Sahel (e.g., {cite.8.'Rotstayn_and_Lohmann_2002}; {cite.8.'Biasutti_and_Giannini_2006}; {cite.8.'Kawase_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Ackerley_et_al_2011}) and northwestern Brazil ({cite.8.'Cox_et_al_2008}), both of which peaked in the 1980s. These hemispheric asymmetric ITCZ effects are overlaid on thermodynamic aerosol effects which moisten subtropical regions, countering GHG-induced drying of these regions ({cite.8.'Ming_et_al_2011}). Studies indicate that aerosols are more effective than an equivalent {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} forcing for shifting precipitation, and that historical trends in several areas cannot be explained without including aerosol forcing ({cite.8.'Bollasina_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Booth_et_al_2012}; {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2012a}; {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2012b}). However, confidence in attribution of any {Topics.*Human_Influence human influence} on zonal shifts in precipitation distribution is only medium ({Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_2.10_3_2_2 Section 10.3.2.2}).

There is increasing evidence but limited agreement that absorbing aerosols influence cloud distributions ({Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_4.7_3_4_2 Section 7.3.4.2}). Absorbing aerosols apparently have complex influences on precipitation in monsoon regions. Model studies of {cite.8.'Stephens_et_al_2004 Stephens et al. (2004)} and {cite.8.'Miller_et_al_2004 Miller et al. (2004)} showed that dust absorption over Africa enhances low-level convergence, vertical velocities and therefore local monsoon circulation and precipitation. On the other hand, {cite.8.'Kawase_et_al_2010 Kawase et al. (2010)} showed that {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} may cause the decreasing precipitation {Glossary.*Trend trend} seen in tropical Africa during austral summer, due to reduction in evaporation and enhanced subsidence. The aerosol effects on the Indian monsoon are similarly complex, and have been the subject of numerous studies (e.g., {cite.8.'Ramanathan_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Chung_and_Ramanathan_2006}; {cite.8.'Lau_et_al_2006}; {cite.8.'Wang_et_al_2009}; Bollasina et al., (2011), but a clear picture of how the regional aerosol forcing correlates with responses has not yet fully emerged. Attribution of changes in monsoon to human influence generally has low confidence ({Chapters.10.10_3 Section 10.3}).

Stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} loss modelling has demonstrated an effect on the SH {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} similar to increased {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, cooling stratospheric temperatures, strengthening the polar vortex and shifting the westerly jet poleward; however causing cooler Antarctic {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures}, with larger influence on austral summer conditions ({cite.8.'Son_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'McLandress_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Thompson_et_al_2011}; see also Sections {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3 10.3.3} and {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_4.11_3_2_4_3 11.3.2.4.3}.) In the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, models indicate that increased tropospheric ozone has caused warming, proportionally more in the NH and notably to the Arctic during winter, mainly during the second half of the 20th century ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2006a}).

{Glossary.*Albedo Albedo} changes due to land use and land cover changes exert a heterogeneous climate forcing ({'Figure_8_9 Figure 8.9}). The surface albedo brightened on the one hand due to a shift from {Glossary.*Forest forest} to brighter croplands, causing local cooling (e.g., {cite.8.'Eliseev_and_Mokhov_2011}; {cite.8.'Lee_et_al_2011}), but also darkened due to the re-expansion of forests to higher latitudes ({cite.8.'Esper_and_Schweingruber_2004}) and increased vegetation height in snowy regions ({cite.8.'Bonfils_et_al_2012}; also {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_5 Section 8.3.5}). Model studies have shown cooling from land use and land cover changes, especially over NH continents, although without demonstrating a detectable signal in observations ({cite.8.'Matthews_et_al_2004}).

In addition to land use and climate-induced vegetation changes, {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} affects vegetation forcing indirectly, reducing transpiration from plants as stomata open less with increasing CO2, resulting in localized atmospheric drying and warming ({Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_2.11_3_2_3.11_3_2_3_1 Section 11.3.2.3.1}; {cite.8.'Joshi_and_Gregory_2008}). These are not included in the standard RF ({Chapters.8.8_1 Section 8.1}) and may be considered feedbacks ({Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_2 Section 8.3.2}). This is modelled to be largest over the Amazon, the central African forest, and to some extent over boreal and temperate forests ({cite.8.'Andrews_et_al_2011}). In the coupled climate modelling study of {cite.8.'Lawrence_and_Chase_2010 Lawrence and Chase (2010)}, the vegetation changes caused significant reduction in {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration}, drying and warming in tropical and subtropical regions, with insignificant cooling at higher latitudes. Overall, vegetation changes may have caused modest cooling at high latitudes and warming at low latitudes, but the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} are large and confidence is very low.

Deposition of BC on snow and ice, and loss of snow and ice darken the surface, reduces albedo, and enhances climate warming. Substantial snow-cover reduction of North America leads to warmer North American summertime temperature in models having a strong snow albedo feedback. These {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} can also have non-local impacts that result from enhanced land-ocean temperature contrast, increasing surface convergence over land and divergence over oceans. A poleward intensification of the high pressure patterns and subtropical jet may also result ({cite.8.'Fletcher_et_al_2009}). BC contributions to snow darkening reduces snow cover, however the magnitude of the effect is very uncertain (see Sections {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2.7_5_2_3 7.5.2.3} and {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_4.8_3_4_4 8.3.4.4}). A model study calculated BC-albedo reduction to cause about 20% Arctic snow/ice cover reduction and 20% of Arctic warming over the previous century ({cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2011}). However, reductions in Arctic soot during the past two decades (e.g., {cite.8.'Hegg_et_al_2009}) have likely reversed that trend (e.g., {cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Skeie_et_al_2011b}; {cite.8.'Lee_et_al_2013}). Cryospheric feedbacks and atmospheric dynamical responses in models have an associated poleward shift in the temperature response to aerosol–cloud interactions ({cite.8.'Kristjansson_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2009a}; {cite.8.'Chen_et_al_2010}).

Solar spectral (UV) irradiance variations along the {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} induce ozone responses by modifying the ozone production rate through photolysis of molecular oxygen ({Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_4.8_4_1_4_1 Section 8.4.1.4.1}), and the resulting differential heating can drive circulation anomalies that lead to regional temperature and precipitation changes ({cite.8.'Haigh_1999}; {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2006b}; {cite.8.'Frame_and_Gray_2010}; {cite.8.'Gray_et_al_2010}). Such solar forcing may influence natural modes of circulation such as the {Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode Northern Annular Mode} (e.g., {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2001}; de la Torre et al., 2006; {cite.8.'Ineson_et_al_2011}), the South Asian Summer {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon} ({cite.8.'Fan_et_al_2009}), the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode Southern Annular Mode} ({cite.8.'Kuroda_and_Kodera_2005}; {cite.8.'Roscoe_and_Haigh_2007}) or the {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({cite.8.'Mann_et_al_2005}). The pattern of temperature response is less uniform than the forcing, for example, warming in the NH, but little response in the SH due to temperature moderation by wind speed enhancement effects on ocean circulation ({cite.8.'Swingedouw_et_al_2011}). Regional responses to solar forcing are mediated by the stratosphere, so that reproducing such change requires spectrally varying solar forcing rather than {Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} forcing ({cite.8.'Lee_et_al_2009}; {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_4 Section 8.4.1.4}).

Stratospheric aerosol clouds (also {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_2.8_4_2_2 Section 8.4.2.2}) from tropical eruptions spread poleward and can cover an entire hemisphere or the globe, depending on the initial latitudinal spread. The aerosol eruption cloud from the 1963 Agung was confined mainly to the SH; the 1982 El Chichón mainly to the NH; and the 1991 Pinatubo covered the globe, all with an e-folding {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of about 1 year (e.g., Antuña et al., 2003). High-latitude eruptions typically stay confined to the high-latitude regions with shorter lifetimes of 2 to 4 months ({cite.8.'Kravitz_and_Robock_2011}). Volcanic aerosols primarily scatter {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} back to space, but also absorb {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation} with the former larger by an order of magnitude. Stratospheric aerosol absorption heats the layer where they reside and produces distinct vertical and horizontal distributions of the heating rate. The temperature and chemical effects of the aerosols also enhance ozone destruction, which somewhat counteracts the radiative heating ({cite.8.'Stenchikov_et_al_2002}). For tropical eruptions, this may affect atmospheric dynamics, with a stronger polar vortex, a positive mode of the Arctic Oscillation, and winter warming over NH continents ({cite.8.'Robock_2000}). Climate responses to solar and volcanic forcings are further discussed in the context of detection and attribution of millennial climate change (see {Chapters.10.10_7 Section 10.7}).

The study of how climate responds to regionally varying patterns of forcing is critical for understanding how local activities impact regional climate; however, the studies are exploratory and generally evoke very low confidence. However there is medium to high confidence in some qualitative but robust features, such as the damped warming of the NH and shifting of the ITCZ from aerosols, and positive feedbacks from high-latitude snow and ice albedo changes.
