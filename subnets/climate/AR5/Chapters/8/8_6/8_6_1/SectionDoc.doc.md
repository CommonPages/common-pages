title: 8.6.1 - Spatial Distribution of Current Radiative Forcing

The {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} such as {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} have the largest {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} in the subtropics, decreasing toward the poles, with the largest forcing in warm and dry regions and smaller values in moist regions and in high-altitude regions ({cite.8.'Taylor_et_al_2011}). For the NTCFs ({Box_8_2 Box 8.2}) their concentration spatial pattern and therefore their RF pattern are highly inhomogeneous, and again meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, clouds, and surface {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} influence how concentration translates to RF.

{'Figure_8_23 Figure 8.23} shows the RF spatial distribution of the major NTCFs together with standard deviation among the ACCMIP models (Shindell et al., 2013c) the net {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} composition ({Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG}+ozone+{Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}) forcing is also shown (lower left panel). These models used unified anthropogenic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of aerosol and ozone {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} (Supplementary Material Figure 8.SM.2), so that the model diversity in RF is due only to differences in model chemical and climate features and natural emissions, and would be larger if uncertainty in the anthropogenic emissions were also included. In general, the confidence in geographical distribution is lower than for global mean, due to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in chemistry, transport and removal of species.

The negative RF due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_radiation_interaction aerosol–radiation interaction} (first row; defined in {'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3}) is greatest in the NH and near populated and {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning regions. The standard deviation for the net RF due to aerosol– radiation interaction is typically largest over regions where vegetation changes are largest (e.g., South Asia and central Africa), due to uncertainties in biomass burning aerosol optical properties and in treatment of secondary organic aerosols. {Glossary.*Carbonaceous_aerosol Carbonaceous aerosol} forcing (second row) is greatest in South and East Asia and can be negative in biomass burning regions due to large weakly absorbing organic components. Absorbing aerosols also have enhanced positive forcing when they overlie high albedo surfaces such as {Glossary.*Cryosphere cryosphere}, desert or clouds, with as much as 50% of {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} RF resulting from BC above clouds ({cite.8.'Zarzycki_and_Bond_2010}).

{'Figure_8_24 Figure 8.24} compares the aerosol RFs for ACCMIP (Shindell et al., 2013c), which are representative of the CMIP5 experiments, with those from the AeroCom {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison model intercomparison} ({cite.8.'Myhre_et_al_2013}) which includes sixteen models that used unified meteorology and are more extensively compared to measurements (e.g., {cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2009b}; {cite.8.'Koffi_et_al_2012}). The forcing results are very similar, establishing the representativeness and validity of the ACCMIP aerosol simulations.

The net aerosol {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} ({'Figure_8_23 Figure 8.23}; third row), includes both aerosol– radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions. The spatial pattern correlates with the RF (first row), except with stronger effect in the outflow regions over oceans. The flux change is larger in the NH than the

SH (e.g., by nearly a factor of 3; {cite.8.'Ming_et_al_2007}). {Glossary.*Rapid_adjustment Rapid adjustment} associated with aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions may enhance or reduce cloud cover depending on the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, cloud dynamics and aerosol loading (e.g., {cite.8.'Randles_and_Ramaswamy_2008}; Koch and Del Genio, 2010; {cite.8.'Persad_et_al_2012}). In general, the ocean-land forcing pattern differs from that reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, where the forcing due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_cloud_interaction aerosol–cloud interaction} were larger over land than ocean ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2007}), and this continues to be a {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty. Since AR4, {cite.8.'Quaas_et_al_2009 Quaas et al. (2009)} showed using satellite retrievals that the correlation between AOD changes and droplet number changes is stronger over oceans than over land and that models tend to overestimate the strength of the relation over land. {cite.8.'Penner_et_al_2011 Penner et al. (2011)} showed that satellite retrievals, due to their dependence on present-day conditions, may underestimate the forcing due to aerosol–cloud interaction, especially over land, although this model analysis may overestimate the cloud condensation nucleus to AOD relation ({cite.8.'Quaas_et_al_2011}). {cite.8.'Wang_and_Penner_2009 Wang and Penner (2009)} also showed that if models include boundary layer nucleation and increase the fraction of sulphur emitted as a primary particle, the effect over land is increased relative to over ocean (see also {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_3 Section 7.5.3}). The aerosol ERF standard deviation is large in biomass burning regions, as for the RF, and in regions where cloud effects differ among models (e.g., northern North America, northeast Asia, Amazonia). The spread in aerosol ERF is much larger than for the RF alone, although the relative standard deviation is no larger (Shindell et al., 2013c).

For components that primarily scatter radiation, the {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} at the surface is similar to the RF (according to the definition in {Chapters.8.8_1.8_1_1 Section 8.1.1}). However for components that absorb radiation in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} the radiation reaching the surface is reduced ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Ramanathan_and_Carmichael_2008}; {cite.8.'Andrews_et_al_2010}). This absorption of incoming {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} alters the vertical temperature profile in the atmospheric column and can thus change atmospheric circulation and cloud formation. The aerosol atmospheric absorption ({'Figure_8_23 Figure 8.23}, bottom right), or the difference between ERF and the analogous radiative flux reaching the surface including rapid adjustments, has a spatial pattern that to lowest order tracks the carbonaceous aerosol forcing, but is also affected by cloud changes, where e.g., cloud loss could enhance atmospheric absorption. Atmospheric aerosol absorption patterns thus mirror the ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction pattern, with larger forcing over continents.

{Glossary.*Ozone Ozone} RF is calculated using the methodology described in Shindell et al. (2013c), but applied to the larger set of models in ACCMIP ({cite.8.'Stevenson_et_al_2013}). The net ozone RF ({'Figure_8_23 Figure 8.23}; fourth row) is largest in subtropical latitudes, and is more positive in the NH than the SH. Pollution in the NH accounts for positive tropospheric forcing; stratospheric ozone loss has caused negative SH polar forcing. Model standard deviation is largest in the polar regions where lower {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}/ upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} changes differ in the models ({cite.8.'Young_et_al_2013}).

Overall, the confidence in aerosol and ozone RF spatial patterns is medium and lower than that for the global mean due to the large regional standard deviations ({'Figure_8_23 Figure 8.23}), and is exacerbated in aerosol ERF patterns due to uncertainty in cloud responses.
