title: 8.6.3 - Spatial Evolution of Radiative Forcing and Response for the Future

Most components of aerosols and ozone {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} are estimated to decrease toward the end of this century in the {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} except {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} in {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} ({'Figure_8_2 Figure 8.2}) and nitrate aerosols, though some species reach the maximum amounts of emissions around the mid-21st century ({'Figure_8_2 Figure 8.2}). The RCPs therefore contrast with the emission scenarios for {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} and {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, which were based on Special Report on {Topics.*Emissions Emissions} {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} (SRES) and have future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of larger increase in the {Glossary.*Near_term_climate_forcers near-term climate forcers} (NTCFs). It has been questioned whether such low emission of NTCFs is possible in the future given the current policies ({cite.8.'Pozzer_et_al_2012}). This section surveys spatial differences in the RF of aerosols and ozone for the future based on the RCPs.

{'Figure_8_26 Figure 8.26} shows the global distributions of changes in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} and ozone {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} in 2030 and 2100 relative to 2000 for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} and 8.5 (Shindell et al., 2013c). Both scenarios indicate reduced aerosol loading, and thus positive forcing over Europe, North America and Asia by 2100 where RF is above +0.5 W m–2 because of substantial reduction of scattering aerosols. The global mean RF due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_radiation_interaction aerosol–radiation interaction} is estimated to be +0.12 and +0.08 W m–2 for RCP2.6 and 8.5, respectively, in 2100. Though the RF by total {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} aerosols is positive, reduced {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} contributes substantial negative forcing especially over the similar regions. The global mean carbonaceous RF including both the effects of BC and OC is estimated to be –0.20 and –0.11 W m–2 for RCP2.6 and 8.5, respectively, in 2100. Early in the century, on the other hand, both scenarios indicate increased negative aerosol forcing over South Asia, with reversal between 2030 and 2100. Emissions of BC, OC and SO2 will reach their maximums early and middle in the century for RCP2.6 and 8.5, respectively in India. In RCP6, high emission levels of SO2 in China persist until the mid-21st century (Supplementary Material Figure 8.SM.1), and then it is {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} to keep a high negative RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction over East Asia. The RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction for {Glossary.*Carbonaceous_aerosol carbonaceous aerosol} is positive over East and South Asia in 2030 relative to 2000 for RCP8.5 because BC emission is also larger in 2030. Over central and southern Africa, a change in the future RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction based on RCPs is not clear mainly because of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the wildfires emissions (see {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_5.7_3_5_3 Section 7.3.5.3}). The global mean total RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction in the future is rather small due to offsetting effects, with reductions in BC, increases in nitrate aerosols, and reductions in scattering aerosols each causing substantially more forcing than the net.

Emissions and atmospheric loadings of natural aerosols are affected by climate change. There is, however, no consensus among studies on future trends of their changes for major natural aerosols, mineral dust and sea salt, as indicated in {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_5.7_3_5_1 Section 7.3.5.1}. The spatial pattern of the aerosol forcing may be influenced by natural aerosols due to reduction in {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} cover leading to increased emission of high-latitude sea salt ({cite.8.'Struthers_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Takemura_2012}) and SOA from vegetation changes ({cite.8.'Tsigaridis_and_Kanakidou_2007}).

The simulations applying the RCPs indicate that the latitude of maximum emission of NTCFs, and therefore of maximum RF, is projected to shift somewhat southward for the next few decades (in 2030 of {'Figure_8_26 Figure 8.26}). The shift of peak aerosol loading southward is expected to cause the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} to continue to shift northward. This, in combination with warming and drying over tropical land, has been modelled to lead to greatly enhanced {Glossary.*Drought drought} conditions in the Amazon ({cite.8.'Cox_et_al_2008}). On the other hand, if the low-latitude aerosol is sufficiently absorbing, broadening of the ITCZ convergence {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} and enhanced cloud cover could result, as modelled for dust ({cite.8.'Perlwitz_and_Miller_2010}).

Reductions in high-latitude BC are expected to contribute to reducing Arctic forcing (e.g., {cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2011}), due to reduction in BC deposition on snow as well as in absorption of sunlight over bright surface. On the other hand, reduction in mid-high-latitude scattering aerosols may offset all or part of the impact of the local Arctic forcing change ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2011}).

{'Figure_8_26 Figure 8.26} also shows the ozone RF in 2030 and 2100 relative to 2000, which includes changes both in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. Recovery of ozone in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} in the 21st century will result in positive forcing in the SH high latitudes in comparison with the year 2000 for both the pathways. This is because of the reduced emissions of ozone-depleting substances controlled under the {Glossary.*Montreal_Protocol Montreal Protocol}, with a small additional effect from a {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} of changes in temperature and in the vertical circulation due to changes in stratospheric compositions ({cite.8.'Kawase_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}). In the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}, on the other hand, a large difference in the CH4 emissions between RCP8.5 and the other pathways shown in {'Figure_8_2 Figure 8.2} leads to a different RF {Glossary.*Trend trend} outside the SH high latitudes. {Glossary.*Ozone Ozone} recovery in the stratosphere and ozone increase in the troposphere leads to a positive RF all over the globe in RCP8.5 with a mean of +0.26 W m–2 in 2100. The cancellation between positive RF due to ozone increase in the stratosphere and negative RF due to ozone decrease in the troposphere results in a global mean RF of –0.12 W m–2 in RCP2.6.

{'Figure_8_26 Figure 8.26} also shows the global distributions of changes in {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} due to both aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions in 2030 and 2100 relative to 2000 for RCP8.5. Although the ERF includes rapid adjustments and therefore its magnitude is much larger than that of RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction, the spatial pattern is generally similar to RF. The ERF in 2100 shows positive values relative to 2000 in North America, Europe and Asia even with RCP8.5, which indicates the aerosol forcing is projected to approach to the pre-industrial level.
