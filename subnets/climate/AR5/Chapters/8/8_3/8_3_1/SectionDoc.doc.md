title: 8.3.1 - Updated Understanding of the Spectral Properties of Greenhouse Gases and Radiative Transfer Codes

{Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} estimates are performed with a combination of radiative transfer codes typical for {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} as well as more detailed radiative transfer codes. Physical properties are needed in the radiative transfer codes such as spectral properties for gases. The HITRAN (HIgh {Glossary.*Resolution Resolution} TRANsmission molecular absorption) database ({cite.8.'Rothman_2010}) is widely used in radiative transfer models. Some researchers studied the difference among different editions of HITRAN databases for diverse uses ({cite.8.'Feng_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Kratz_2008}; {cite.8.'Feng_and_Zhao_2009}; {cite.8.'Fomin_and_Falaleeva_2009}; {cite.8.'Lu_et_al_2012}). Model calculations have shown that modifications of the spectroscopic characteristics tend to have a modest effect on the determination of RF estimates of order 2 to 3% of the calculated RF {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the combined doubling of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} and {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}. These results showed that even the largest overall RF induced by differences among the HITRAN databases is considerably smaller than the range reported for the modelled RF estimates; thus the line parameter updates to the HITRAN database are not a significant {Glossary.*Source source} for discrepancies in the RF calculations appearing in the IPCC reports. However, the more recent HITRAN data set is still recommended, as the HITRAN process offers internal verification and tends to progress closer to the best laboratory measurements. It is found that the differences among the water vapour continuum absorption formulations tend to be comparable to the differences among the various HITRAN databases ({cite.8.'Paynter_and_Ramaswamy_2011}); but use of the older Robert continuum formula produces significantly larger flux differences, thus, replacement of the older continuum is warranted ({cite.8.'Kratz_2008}) and there are still numerous unresolved issues left in the continuum expression, especially related to shortwave radiative transfer ({cite.8.'Shine_et_al_2012}). Differences in absorption data from various HITRAN versions are very likely a small contributor to the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in RF of {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}.

Line-by-line (LBL) models using the HITRAN data set as an input are the benchmark of radiative transfer models for GHGs. Some researchers compared different LBL models ({cite.8.'Zhang_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Collins_et_al_2006}) and line-wing cutoff, line-shape function and gas continuum absorption treatment effects on LBL calculations ({cite.8.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.8.'Fomin_and_Falaleeva_2009}). The agreement between LBL codes has been investigated in many studies and found to generally be within a few percent (e.g., {cite.8.'Collins_et_al_2006}; {cite.8.'Iacono_et_al_2008}; {cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2011a}) and to compare well to observed radiative fluxes under controlled situations ({cite.8.'Oreopoulos_et_al_2012}). {cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2011a Forster et al. (2011a)} evaluated global mean radiatively important properties of chemistry {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} (CCMs) and found that the combined {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} global annual mean instantaneous RF at the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} is within 30% of LBL models for all CCM radiation codes tested. The accuracies of the LW RF due to CO2 and tropospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} increase are generally very good and within 10% for most of the participation models, but problems remained in simulating RF for stratospheric water vapour and ozone changes with errors between 3% and 200% compared to LBL models. Whereas the differences in the results from CCM radiation codes were large, the agreement among the LW LBL codes was within 5%, except for stratospheric water vapour changes.

Most intercomparison studies of the RF of GHGs are for clear-sky and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}-free conditions; the introduction of clouds would greatly complicate the targets of research and are usually omitted in the intercomparison exercises of GCM radiation codes and LBL codes (e.g., {cite.8.'Collins_et_al_2006}; {cite.8.'Iacono_et_al_2008}). It is shown that clouds can reduce the magnitude of RF due to GHGs by about 25% ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Worden_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Zhang_et_al_2011}), but the influence of clouds on the diversity in RF is found to be within 5% in four detailed radiative transfer schemes with realistic cloud distributions ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2005}). Estimates of GHG RF are based on the LBL codes or the radiative transfer codes compared and validated against LBL models, and the uncertainty range from {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} in the RF of GHG of 10% is retained. We underscore that uncertainty in RF calculations in many {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} is substantially higher owing both to radiative transfer codes and meteorological data such as clouds adopted in the simulations.
