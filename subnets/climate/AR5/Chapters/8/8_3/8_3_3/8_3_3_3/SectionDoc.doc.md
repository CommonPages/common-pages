title: 8.3.3.3 - Stratospheric Water Vapour

Stratospheric water vapour is dependent on the amount entering from the tropical {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and from direct injection by volcanic plumes ({cite.8.'Joshi_and_Jones_2009}) and aircraft, and the in situ chemical production from the oxidation of {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and hydrogen. This contrasts with tropospheric water vapour which is almost entirely controlled by the balance between evaporation and precipitation (see {FAQ_8_1 FAQ 8.1}). We consider trends in the transport (for instance, due to the {Glossary.*Brewer_Dobson_circulation Brewer–Dobson circulation} or {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} temperature changes) to be climate {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} rather than a {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} so the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} RFs come from oxidation of CH4 and hydrogen, and {Topics.*Emissions emissions} from stratospheric aircraft.

{cite.8.'Myhre_et_al_2007 Myhre et al. (2007)} used observations of the vertical profile of CH4 to deduce a contribution from oxidation of anthropogenic CH4 of 0.083 W m–2 which compares with the value of 0.07 W m–2 from calculations in a 2D model in {cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005 Hansen et al. (2005)}. Both of these values are consistent with {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} which obtained the stratospheric water vapour forcing by scaling the CH4 direct forcing by 15%. Thus the time evolution of this forcing is also obtained by scaling the CH4 forcing by 15%. The best estimate and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range from AR4 of 0.07 (0.02 to 0.12) W m–2 remain unchanged and the large uncertainty range is due to large differences found in the intercomparison studies of radiative transfer modelling for changes in stratospheric water vapour (see {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_1 Section 8.3.1}).

RF from the current aircraft fleet through stratospheric water vapour emissions is very small. {cite.8.'Wilcox_et_al_2012 Wilcox et al. (2012)} estimate a contribution from civilian aircraft in 2005 of 0.0009 (0.0003 to 0.0013) W m–2 with high confidence in the upper limit. Water vapour emissions from aircraft in the troposphere also contribute to contrails which are discussed in {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_4.8_3_4_5 Section 8.3.4.5}.
