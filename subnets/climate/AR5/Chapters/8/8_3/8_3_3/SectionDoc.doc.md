title: 8.3.3 - Ozone and Stratospheric Water Vapour

Unlike for the {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}, the estimate of the tropospheric and stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} concentration changes are almost entirely model based for the full pre-industrial to present-day interval (though, especially for the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}, more robust observational evidence on changes is available for recent decades; see {Chapters.2.2_2 Section 2.2}).

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessed the RF (for 1750–2005) from tropospheric ozone to be 0.35 W m–2 from multi-model studies with a high 95th percentile of 0.65 W m–2 to allow for the possibility of model overestimates of the pre-industrial tropospheric ozone levels. The stratospheric ozone RF was assessed from observational trends from 1979 to 1998 to be –0.05 ± 0.1 W m–2, with the 90% confidence range increased to reflect uncertainty in the {Glossary.*Trend trend} prior to 1979 and since 1998. In AR4 the RF from stratospheric water vapour generated by {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} oxidation was assessed to be +0.07 ± 0.05 W m–2 based on {cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005 Hansen et al. (2005)}.

Since AR4, there have been a few individual studies of tropospheric or stratospheric ozone {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2006a}, 2006c, 2013a; Skeieetal., 2011a; Søvdeetal., 2011), a multi-model study of stratospheric ozone RF in the 2010 WMO stratospheric ozone assessment ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2011b}), and the ACCMIP multi-model study of tropospheric and tropospheric + stratospheric chemistry models ({cite.8.'Conley_et_al_2013}; {cite.8.'Stevenson_et_al_2013}). There is now greater understanding of how tropospheric ozone {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} can affect stratospheric ozone, and how ODSs can affect tropospheric ozone ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2013a}). We assess the total ozone RF to be +0.35 (0.15 to 0.55) W m–2. This can be split according to altitude or by emitted species ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2013a}). We assess these contributions to be 0.40 (0.20 to 0.60) W m–2 for ozone in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} and –0.05 ± 0.10 W m–2 for ozone in the stratosphere based on the studies presented in {'Table_8_3 Table 8.3}. Alternatively, the contributions to the total ozone forcing can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} as 0.50 (0.30 to 0.70) W m–2 from ozone precursors and –0.15 (–0.3 to 0.0) W m–2 from the effect of ODSs. The value attributed to ODSs is assessed to be slightly smaller in magnitude than in the two studies quoted in {'Table_8_3 Table 8.3} (Søvde et al., 2011; {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2013a}) because the models used for these had stratospheric ozone RFs with higher magnitudes than the ACCMIP mean ({cite.8.'Conley_et_al_2013}). Differences between the ERFs and RFs for tropospheric and stratospheric ozone are likely to be small compared to the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the RFs ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2013b}), so the assessed values for the ERFs are the same as those for the RFs.

{table:'Table_8_3}

The influence of climate change is typically included in ozone RF estimates as those are based on modelled concentration changes, but the available literature provides insufficient evidence for the sign and magnitude of the impact and we therefore refrain from giving an estimate except to assess that it is very likely to be smaller than the overall uncertainty in the total RF. Unlike the WMGHGs, there are significant latitudinal variations in the RFs from changes in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. The implications of inhomogeneous RFs are explored in more detail in {Chapters.8.8_6 Section 8.6}.

There has been one study since AR4 ({cite.8.'Myhre_et_al_2007}) on the RF from water vapour formed from the stratospheric oxidation of CH4 ({Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_3.8_3_3_3 Section 8.3.3.3}). This is consistent with the AR4 value and so has not led to any change in the recommended value of 0.07 (0.02 to 0.12) W m–2 since AR4.
