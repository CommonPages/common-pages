title: 8.3.2.4.3 - Perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride

These gases have lifetimes of thousands to tens of thousands of years (Table 8.A.1); therefore {Topics.*Emissions emissions} essentially accumulate in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} on the time scales considered here. CF4 has a natural {Glossary.*Source source} and a 1750 concentration of 35 ppt (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_1.2_2_1_1.2_2_1_1_4 Section 2.2.1.1.4}). These gases currently contribute 0.01 W mâ€“2 of the total {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}.
