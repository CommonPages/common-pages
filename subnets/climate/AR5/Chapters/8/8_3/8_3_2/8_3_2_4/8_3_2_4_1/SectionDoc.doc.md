title: 8.3.2.4.1 - Chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons

The CFCs and HCFCs contribute approximately 11% of the {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}. Although {Topics.*Emissions emissions} have been drastically reduced for CFCs, their long lifetimes mean that reductions take substantial time to affect their concentrations. The RF from CFCs has declined since 2005 (mainly due to a reduction in the concentrations of {Glossary.*CFC CFC}-11 and CFC-12), whereas the RF from HCFCs is still rising (mainly due to {Glossary.*HCFC HCFC}-22).
