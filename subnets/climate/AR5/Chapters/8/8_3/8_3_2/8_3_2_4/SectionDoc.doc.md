title: 8.3.2.4 - Other Well-mixed Greenhouse Gases

RFs of the other {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHG} are shown in {'Figure_8_6 Figure 8.6} (b and c) and {'Table_8_2 Table 8.2}. The contribution of groups of {Glossary.*Halocarbons halocarbons} to the rate of change of {Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} is shown in {'Figure_8_6 Figure 8.6} (d). Between 1970 and 1990 halocarbons made a significant contribution to the rate of change of RF. The rate of change in the total WMGHG RF was higher in 1970 to 1990 with high confidence compared to the present owing to higher contribution from non-{Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} gases especially the halocarbons. Since the {Glossary.*Montreal_Protocol Montreal Protocol} and its amendments, the rate of change of RF from halocarbons and related compounds has been much less, but still just positive (total RF of 0.360 W m–2 in 2011 compared to 0.351 W m–2 in 2005) as the growth of HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs and other halogens (SF6, SO2F2, NF3) RFs (total 0.022 W m–2 since 2005) more than compensates for the decline in the CFCs, CH3CCl3 and CCl4 RFs (–0.013 W m–2 since 2005). The total halocarbon RF is dominated by four gases, namely {Glossary.*CFC CFC}-12, trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), chlorodifluoromethane ({Glossary.*HCFC HCFC}-22) and trichlorofluoroeethane (CFC-113) in that order, which account for about 85% of the total halocarbon RF (see {'Table_8_2 Table 8.2}) . The indirect RF from the impacts of ODSs is discussed in {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_3.8_3_3_2 Section 8.3.3.2}.
