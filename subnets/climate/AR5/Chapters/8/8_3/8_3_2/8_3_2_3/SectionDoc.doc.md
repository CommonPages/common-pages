title: 8.3.2.3 - Nitrous Oxide

Concentrations of nitrous oxide have risen from 270 ± 7 ppb in 1750 to 324.2 ± 0.1 ppb in 2011, an increase of 5 ppb since 2005 (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_1.2_2_1_1.2_2_1_1_3 Section 2.2.1.1.3}). N O now has the third largest {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} of the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} 2 gases, at 0.17 ± 0.03 W m–2 an increase of 6% since 2005 (see {'Table_8_2 Table 8.2}) where the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} is due approximately equally to the pre-industrial concentration and radiative transfer. Only the direct RF from changing nitrous oxide concentrations is included. Indirect effects of {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} on stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} are not taken into account here but are discussed briefly in {Chapters.8.8_7.8_7_2 Section 8.7.2}.
