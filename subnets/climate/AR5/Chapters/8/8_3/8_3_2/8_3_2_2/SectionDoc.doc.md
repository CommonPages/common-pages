title: 8.3.2.2 - Methane

Globally averaged surface {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} concentrations have risen from 722 ± 25 ppb in 1750 to 1803 ± 2 ppb by 2011 (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_1.2_2_1_1.2_2_1_1_2 Section 2.2.1.1.2}). Over that time scale the rise has been due predominantly to changes in anthropogenic-related CH4. {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of other compounds have also affected CH4 concentrations by changing its removal rate ({Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_3.8_2_3_3 Section 8.2.3.3}). Using the formula from {cite.8.'Myhre_et_al_1998 Myhre et al. (1998)} (see Supplementary Material Table 8.SM.1) the RF for CH4 from 1750 to 2011 is 0.48 ± 0.05 W m–2, with an {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} dominated by the radiative transfer calculation. This increase of 0.01 W m–2 since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} is due to the 29 ppb increase in the CH4 {Glossary.*Mixing_ratio mixing ratio}. This is much larger than the 11 ppb increase between {cite.1.'IPCC_2001 TAR} and AR4, and has been driven by increases in net natural and anthropogenic emissions, but the relative contributions are not well quantified. Recent trends in CH4 and their causes are discussed in Sections {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_1.2_2_1_1.2_2_1_1_2 2.2.1.1.2} and {Chapters.6.6_3.6_3_3.6_3_3_1 6.3.3.1}. CH4 concentrations do vary with latitude and decrease above the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause}; however, this variation contributes only 2% to the uncertainty in RF ({cite.8.'Freckleton_et_al_1998}).

In this section only the direct {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} from changing CH4 concentrations is addressed. CH4 emissions can also have indirect effects on climate through impacts on {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, stratospheric water vapour, {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}, sulphate {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} and lifetimes of HFCs and HCFCs ({cite.8.'Boucher_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Collins_et_al_2010}). Some of these are discussed further in Sections {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_3 8.3.3}, {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_1 8.5.1} and {Chapters.8.8_7.8_7_2 8.7.2}.
