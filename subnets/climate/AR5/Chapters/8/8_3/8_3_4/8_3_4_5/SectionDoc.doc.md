title: 8.3.4.5 - Contrails and Contrail-Induced Cirrus

{cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} assessed the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} of contrails (persistent linear contrails) as +0.01 (–0.007 to +0.02) W m–2 and provided no estimate for contrail induced cirrus. In AR5, {Chapters.7 Chapter 7} gives a best estimate of RF due to contrails of +0.01 (+0.005 to +0.03) W m–2 and an {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} estimate of the combined contrails and contrail-induced cirrus of +0.05 (+0.02 to +0.15) W m–2. Since AR4, the evidence for contrail-induced cirrus has increased because of observational studies (for further details see {Chapters.7.7_2.7_2_7 Section 7.2.7}).
