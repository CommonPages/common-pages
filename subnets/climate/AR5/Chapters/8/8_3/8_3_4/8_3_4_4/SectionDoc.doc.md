title: 8.3.4.4 - Black Carbon Deposition in Snow and Ice

Because absorption by ice is very weak at visible and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} in snow makes the snow darker and increases absorption. This is not enough darkening to be seen by eye, but it is enough to be important for climate (Warren and Wiscombe, 1980; {cite.8.'Clarke_and_Noone_1985}). Several studies since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} have re-examined this issue and find that the RF may be weaker than the estimates of {cite.8.'Hansen_and_Nazarenko_2004 Hansen and Nazarenko (2004)} in AR4 ({cite.8.'Flanner_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Koch_et_al_2009a}; {cite.8.'Rypdal_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Lee_et_al_2013}). The {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} BC on snow/ ice is assessed to have a positive global and annual mean RF of +0.04 W m−2, with a 0.02–0.09 W m−2 5 to 95% {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range (see further description in {Chapters.7.7_5.7_5_2.7_5_2_3 Section 7.5.2.3}). This RF has a two to four times larger global mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} change per unit {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} than a change in {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}.

In {'Figure_8_8 Figure 8.8}, the time evolution of global mean RF due to BC on snow and ice is shown based on multi-model simulations in ACCMIP ({cite.8.'Lee_et_al_2013}) for 1850, 1930, 1980 and 2000. The results show a maximum in the RF in 1980 with a small increase since 1850 and a 20% lower RF in 2000 compared to 1980. Those results are supported by observations. The BC concentration in the Arctic {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is observed to be declining since 1990, at least in the Western Hemisphere portion ({cite.8.'Sharma_et_al_2004}), which should lead to less deposition of BC on the snow surface. Surveys across Arctic during 1998 and 2005 to 2009 showed that the BC content of Arctic snow appears to be lower than in 1984 ({cite.8.'Doherty_et_al_2010}) and found BC concentrations in Canada, Alaska and the Arctic Ocean (e.g., {cite.8.'Hegg_et_al_2009}), about a factor of 2 lower than measured in the 1980s (e.g., {cite.8.'Clarke_and_Noone_1985}). Large-area field campaigns ({cite.8.'Huang_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Ye_et_al_2012}) found that the BC content of snow in northeast China is comparable to values found in Europe. The steep drop off in BC content of snow with latitude in northeast China may indicate that there is not much BC in the Arctic coming from China ({cite.8.'Huang_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Ye_et_al_2012}; {cite.8.'Wang_et_al_2013}). The change in the spatial pattern of {Topics.*Emissions emission} of BC is a main cause for the difference in the temporal development of RF due to BC on snow and ice compared to the BC from RF due to {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–radiation interaction over the last decades.
