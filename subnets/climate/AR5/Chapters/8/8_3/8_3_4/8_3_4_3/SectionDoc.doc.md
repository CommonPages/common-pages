title: 8.3.4.3 - Aerosol–Cloud Interactions

The RF by {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} effects on cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} was previously referred to as the Twomey or cloud albedo effect (see {Chapters.7.7_1 Section 7.1}). Although this RF can be calculated, no estimate of this forcing is given because it has heuristic value only and does not simply translate to the {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_cloud_interaction aerosol–cloud interaction}. The total aerosol ERF, namely ERF due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions (excluding {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} on snow and ice) provided in {Chapters.7 Chapter 7} is estimated with a 5 to 95% {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} between –1.9 and –0.1 W m–2 with a best estimate value of –0.9 W m–2 (medium confidence). The likely range of this forcing is between –1.5 and –0.4 W m–2. The estimate of ERF due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol-cloud interaction is lower (i.e., less negative) than the corresponding {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} RF estimate of –1.2 W m–2 because the latter was based mainly on {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} studies that did not take secondary processes (such as aerosol effects on mixed-phase and/or convective clouds and effects on {Glossary.*Longwave_radiation longwave radiation}) into account. This new best estimate of ERF due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interaction is also consistent with the studies allowing cloud-scale processes and related responses and with the lower estimates of this forcing inferred from satellite observations.

One reason an expert judgment estimate of ERF due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interaction is provided rather than ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction specifically is that the individual contributions are very difficult to disentangle. These contributions are the response of processes that are the outputs from a system that is constantly readjusting to multiple nonlinear {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}. Assumptions of independence and linearity are required to deduce ERF due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_radiation_interaction aerosol–radiation interaction} and ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction (although there is no a priori reason why the individual ERFs should be simply additive). Under these assumptions, ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction is deduced as the difference between ERF due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interaction and ERF due to aerosol–radiation interaction alone. This yields an ERF due to aerosol–cloud interaction estimate of –0.45 W m–2 which is much smaller in magnitude than the –1.4 W m–2 median forcing value of the models summarized in {'Figure_7_19 Figure 7.19} and is also smaller in magnitude than the AR4 estimates of –0.7 W m–2 for RF due to aerosol–cloud interaction.
