title: 8.3.5.6 - Conclusions

There is still a rather wide range of estimates of the {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} change due to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Land_Use_Change land use change}, and its {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}. Although most published studies provide an estimate close to –0.2 W m–2, there is convincing evidence that it may be somewhat weaker as the albedo difference between natural and anthropogenic land cover may have been overestimated. In addition, non-radiative impact of land use have a similar magnitude, and may be of opposite sign, as the albedo effect (though these are not part of RF). A comparison of the impact of land use change according to seven {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} showed a wide range of results ({cite.8.'Pitman_et_al_2009}), partly due to difference in the implementation of land cover change, but mostly due to different assumptions on {Glossary.*Ecosystem ecosystem} albedo, plant phenology and {Glossary.*Evapotranspiration evapotranspiration}. There is no agreement on the sign of the temperature change induced by anthropogenic land use change. It is very likely that land use change led to an increase of the Earth albedo with a RF of –0.15 ± 0.10 W m–2, but a net cooling of the surface—accounting for processes that are not limited to the albedo—is about as likely as not.
