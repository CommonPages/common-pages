title: Box 8.1 - Definition of Radiative Forcing and Effective Radiative Forcing

The two most commonly used measures of {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} in this chapter are the radiative forcing (RF) and the effective radiative forcing ({Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF}). RF is defined, as it was in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, as the change in net downward radiative flux at the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, while holding surface and tropospheric temperatures and state variables such as water vapor and cloud cover fixed at the unperturbed values.

ERF is the change in net TOA downward radiative flux after allowing for atmospheric temperatures, water vapour and clouds to adjust, but with {Glossary.*Surface_temperature surface temperature} or a portion of surface conditions unchanged. Although there are multiple methods to calculate ERF, we take ERF to mean the method in which sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} cover are fixed at climatological values unless otherwise specified. Land surface properties (temperature, snow and ice cover and vegetation) are allowed to adjust in this method. Hence ERF includes both the effects of the forcing agent itself and the rapid adjustments to that agent (as does RF, though stratospheric temperature is the only adjustment for the latter). In the case of aerosols, the rapid adjustments of clouds encompass effects that have been referred to as indirect or semi-direct forcings (see {'Figure_7_3 Figure 7.3} and {Chapters.7.7_5 Section 7.5}), with some of these same cloud responses also taking place for other forcing agents (see {Chapters.7.7_2 Section 7.2}). Calculation of ERF requires longer simulations with more complex models than calculation of RF, but the inclusion of the additional rapid adjustments makes ERF a better indicator of the eventual global mean temperature response, especially for aerosols. When forcing is {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to {Topics.*Emissions emissions} or used for calculation of emission metrics, additional responses including atmospheric chemistry and the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} are also included in both RF and ERF (see {Chapters.8.8_1.8_1_2 Section 8.1.2}). The general term forcing is used to refer to both RF and ERF.
