title: 8.5 - Synthesis of Global Mean Radiative Forcing, Past and Future

The {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} can be used to quantify the various agents that drive climate change over the Industrial Era or the various contributions to future climate change. There are multiple ways in which RF can be {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to underlying causes, each providing various perspectives on the importance of the different factors driving climate change. This section evaluates the RF with respect to emitted component and with respect to the ultimate atmospheric concentrations. The {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the RF agents vary and the confidence levels for these are presented in this section. Finally, this section shows historical and {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} of future time evolution of RF.
