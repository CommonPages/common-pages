title: 8.5.3 - Future Radiative Forcing

Projections of global mean RF are assessed based on results from multiple sources examining the RF due to RCP {Topics.*Emissions emissions}: the ACCMIP initiative (see {Chapters.8.8_2 Section 8.2}) provides analysis of the RF or {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing ERF} due to aerosols and ozone (Shindell et al., 2013c), while {Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG}, land use and stratospheric water RFs are taken from the results of calculations with the reduced-complexity Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change 6 (MAGICC6) driven by the RCP emissions and land use ({cite.8.'Meinshausen_et_al_2011a}). While MAGICC6 also estimated ozone and aerosol RF, those values differ substantially from the ACCMIP values and are considered less realistic. Additional discussion of biases in the MAGICC6 results due to the simplified representations of atmospheric chemistry and the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle}, along with further discussion on the representativeness of the RCP {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} in context with the broader set of {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} in the literature, is presented in {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_5 Section 11.3.5} and {Chapters.12.12_3 Section 12.3} (also see {Chapters.8.8_2 Section 8.2}). As the ACCMIP project provided projected {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} primarily at 2030 and 2100, we hereafter highlight those times. Although understanding the relative contributions of various processes to the overall effect of aerosols on forcing is useful, we emphasize the total aerosol ERF, which includes all aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, as this is the most indicative of the aerosol forcing driving climate change. We also present traditional RF due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_radiation_interaction aerosol–radiation interaction} (previously called {Glossary.*Direct_aerosol_effect direct aerosol effect}) but do not examine further the various components of aerosol ERF. {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} forcing estimates, both mean and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} ranges, are derived from the 10 ACCMIP models, 8 of which are also CMIP5 models. We analyze forcing during the 21st century (relative to 2000), and hence the WMGHG forcing changes are in addition to persistent forcing from historical WMGHG increases.

Analysis of forcing at 2030 relative to 2000 shows that under {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, total ozone (tropospheric and stratospheric) forcing is near zero, RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction is positive but small, and hence WMGHG forcing dominates changes over this time period ({'Figure_8_21 Figure 8.21}). WMGHG forcing is dominated by increasing {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, as declining {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} and increasing {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O} have nearly offsetting small contributions to forcing. Aerosol ERF was not evaluated for this RCP under ACCMIP, and values cannot be readily inferred from RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction as these are not directly proportional. Under {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}, RF due to aerosol– radiation interaction in 2030 is weakly negative, aerosol ERF is positive with a fairly small value and large uncertainty range, total ozone forcing is positive but small (~0.1 W m–2), and thus WMGHG forcing again dominates with a value exceeding 1 W m–2. As with RCP2.6, WMGHG forcing is dominated by CO2, but under this scenario the other {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} all contribute additional positive forcing. Going to 2100, ozone forcing diverges in sign between the two scenarios, consistent with changes in the tropospheric ozone burden ({'Figure_8_4 Figure 8.4}) which are largely attributable to projected CH4 emissions, but is small in either case. {Glossary.*Ozone Ozone} RF is the net impact of a positive forcing from stratospheric ozone recovery owing to reductions in {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} ozone-depleting halocarbon emissions in both scenarios and a larger impact from changes in tropospheric {Glossary.*Precursors precursors} (Shindell et al., 2013c) which have a negative forcing in RCP2.6 and a positive forcing in RCP8.5.

The two scenarios are fairly consistent in their trends in RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction by component ({'Figure_8_21 Figure 8.21}). There is positive RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction due to reductions in sulfate aerosol. This is largely offset by negative RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction by primary carbonaceous aerosols and especially by nitrate (though nearly all CMIP5 models did not include nitrate), leaving net aerosol RF due to aerosol–radiation interaction values that are very small, 0.1 W m–2 or less in magnitude, in either scenario at 2030 and 2100. Nitrate aerosols continue to increase through 2100 as ammonia emissions rise steadily due to increased use of agricultural fertilizer even as all other aerosol precursor emissions decrease ({'Figure_8_2 Figure 8.2}), including sulphur dioxide which drives the reduction in sulphate aerosol that also contributes to additional formation of nitrate aerosols in the future ({cite.8.'Bauer_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Bellouin_et_al_2011}). Aerosol ERF is likely similar at this time in all scenarios given that they all have greatly reduced emissions of all aerosols and aerosol precursors other than ammonia. Aerosol ERF shows a large positive value at 2100 relative to 2000, nearly returning to its 1850 levels (the 2100 versus 1850 ERF represents a decrease in ERF of 91% relative to the 2000 versus 1850 value), as is expected given the RCP emissions. Thus although some models project large increases in nitrate RF in the future, the reduction in overall aerosol loading appears to lead to such a strong reduction in aerosol ERF that the impact of aerosols becomes very small under these {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs}. Of course the projections of drastic reductions in primary aerosol as well as aerosol and ozone precursor emissions may be overly optimistic as they assume virtually all nations in the world become wealthy and that emissions reductions are directly dependent on wealth. The RCPs also contain substantially lower projected growth in {Glossary.*HFC HFC} emissions than in some studies (e.g., {cite.8.'Velders_et_al_2009}).

Although aerosol ERF becomes less negative by nearly 1 W m–2 from 2000 to 2100, this change is still small compared with the increased WMGHG forcing under RCP8.5, which is roughly 6 W m–2 during this time ({'Figure_8_21 Figure 8.21}). Roughly 5 W m–2 of this WMGHG forcing comes from CO2, with substantial additional forcing from increases in both CH4 and nitrous oxide and only a very small negative forcing from reductions in {Glossary.*Halocarbons halocarbons}. Under RCP2.6, the WMGHG forcing is only about 0.5 W m–2 during this time, as relatively strong decreases in CH4 and halocarbon forcing offset roughly 40% of the increased CO2 forcing, which is itself far less than under RCP8.5. Hence under this scenario, the projected future forcing due to aerosol reductions is actually stronger than the WMGHG forcing. Viewing the timeseries of the various forcings, however, indicates that aerosol ERF is returning to its pre-industrial levels, so that net forcing becomes increasingly dominated by WMGHGs regardless of scenario during the 21st century ({'Figure_8_22 Figure 8.22}). As the forcing is so heavily dominated by WMGHGs at 2100, and the WMGHG concentrations (CO2) or emissions (others) were chosen to match forcing targets, all the scenarios show net forcing values at that time that are fairly close to the scenarios’ target values. The reduced aerosol forcing, with its large uncertainty, leads to a pronounced decrease in the uncertainty of the total net forcing by 2100. Based on the spread across ACCMIP models (using ERF for aerosols and converting to ERF for {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}), the 90% confidence interval (CI) is about 20% for the 2100 net forcing, versus 26% for 2030 under RCP8.5 and 45–61% for 1980 and 2000 (Shindell et al., 2013c). The total ERF due to all causes has been independently estimated based on the transient response in the CMIP5 models and a linear forcing-response relationship derived through regression of the modelled response to an instantaneous increase in CO2 ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2013}). Uncertainties based on {Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} behave similarly, with the 90% CI for net total ERF decreasing from 53% for 2003 to only 24 to 34% for 2100. Forcing relative to 2000 due to land use (via {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} only) and stratospheric water vapor changes are not shown separately as their projected values under the four RCPs are quite small: –0.09 to 0.00 and –0.03 to 0.10 W m–2, respectively.

The CMIP5 forcing estimates ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2013}) for the total projected 2030 and 2100 ERF are slightly smaller than the results obtained from the ACCMIP models (or the RCP targets; see {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_3 Section 12.3.3}). Examining the subset of models included in both this regression analysis and in ACCMIP shows that the ACCMIP subset show forcings on the low side of the mean value obtained from the full set of CMIP5 analyzed, indicating that the discrepancy between the methods is not related to analysis of a different set of models. Instead, it may reflect nonlinearities in the response to forcing that are not represented by the regression analysis of the response to abrupt CO2 increase experiments ({cite.8.'Long_and_Collins_2013}) or differences in the response to other forcing agents relative to the response to CO2 used in deriving the CMIP5 estimates (see also 12.3.3).

Natural forcings will also change in the future. The magnitudes cannot be reliably projected, but are likely to be small at multi-decadal scales (see {Chapters.8.8_4 Section 8.4}). Brief episodic volcanic forcing could be large, however.
