title: 8.2.2 - Global Chemistry Modelling in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5

Because the distribution of NTCFs cannot be estimated from observations alone, coupled chemistry-climate simulations are required to define their evolution and associated {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}. While several CMIP5 modeling groups performed simulations with interactive chemistry (i.e., computed simultaneously within the {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model}), many models used as input pre-computed distributions of radiatively active gases and/ or aerosols. To assess the distributions of chemical species and their respective RF, many research groups participated in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate {Topics.*Model_Intercomparison Model Intercomparison} Project (ACCMIP).

The ACCMIP simulations ({cite.8.'Lamarque_et_al_2013}) were defined to provide information on the long-term changes in atmospheric composition with a few, well-defined atmospheric simulations. Because of the nature of the simulations (pre-industrial, present-day and future climates), only a limited number of chemistry-transport models (models which require a full definition of the meteorological fields needed to simulate physical processes and transport) participated in the ACCMIP project, which instead drew primarily from the same General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}) as CMIP5 (see {cite.8.'Lamarque_et_al_2013} for a list of the participating models and their configurations), with extensive model evaluation against observations ({cite.8.'Bowman_et_al_2013}; {cite.8.'Lee_et_al_2013}; Shindell et al., 2013c; {cite.8.'Voulgarakis_et_al_2013}; {cite.8.'Young_et_al_2013}).

In all CMIP5/ACCMIP chemistry simulations, {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} and {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} burning {Topics.*Emissions emissions} are specified. More specifically, a single set of historical anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions ({cite.8.'Lamarque_et_al_2010}) and one set of emissions for each of the {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} (van Vuuren et al., 2011) was defined ({'Figure_8_2 Figure 8.2}). This was designed to increase the comparability of simulations. However, these uniform emission specifications mask the existing uncertainty (e.g., {cite.8.'Bond_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Lu_et_al_2011}), so that there is in fact a considerable range in the estimates and time evolution of recent anthropogenic emissions ({cite.8.'Granier_et_al_2011}). Historical reconstructions of biomass burning (wildfires and {Glossary.*Deforestation deforestation}) also exhibit quite large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({cite.8.'Kasischke_and_Penner_2004}; {cite.8.'Ito_and_Penner_2005}; {cite.8.'Schultz_et_al_2008}; van der Werf et al., 2010). In addition, the RCP biomass burning {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} do not include the {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} between climate change and fires discussed in {cite.8.'Bowman_et_al_2009 Bowman et al. (2009)}, {cite.8.'Pechony_and_Shindell_2010 Pechony and Shindell (2010)} and {cite.8.'Thonicke_et_al_2010 Thonicke et al. (2010)}. Finally, the RCP anthropogenic precursor emissions of NTCFs tend to span a smaller range than available from existing {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} (van Vuuren et al., 2011). The ACCMIP simulations therefore provide an estimate of the uncertainty due to range of representation of physical and chemical processes in models, but do not incorporate uncertainty in emissions.
