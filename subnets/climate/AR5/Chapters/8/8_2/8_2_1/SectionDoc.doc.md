title: 8.2.1 - Introduction

Most radiatively active compounds in the Earthâ€™s {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} are chemically active, meaning that atmospheric chemistry plays a large role in determining their burden and residence time. In the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, a gaseous chemically active compound can be affected by (1) interaction with other species (including aerosols and water) in its immediate vicinity and (2) interaction with {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} (photolysis). Physical processes (wet removal and dry deposition) act on some chemical compounds (gas or aerosols) to further define their residence time in the atmosphere. Atmospheric chemistry is characterized by many interactions and patterns of temporal or spatial variability, leading to significant nonlinearities ({cite.8.'Kleinman_et_al_2001}) and a wide range of time scales of importance ({cite.8.'Isaksen_et_al_2009}).

This section assesses updates in understanding of processes, modelling and observations since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (see {Chapters.2.2_3 Section 2.3}) on key reactive species contributing to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF}. Note that aerosols, including processes responsible for the formation of aerosols, are extensively described in {Chapters.7.7_3 Section 7.3}.
