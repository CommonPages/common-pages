title: 8.2.3.6 - Aerosols

{Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol} particles are present in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} with size ranges from a few nanometres to tens of micrometres. They are the results of direct emission (primary aerosols: {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC}, OC, sea salt, dust) into the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} or as products of chemical reactions (secondary inorganic aerosols: sulphate, nitrate, ammonium; and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs)) occurring in the atmosphere. Secondary inorganic aerosols are the products of reactions involving sulphur dioxide, ammonia and nitric oxide {Topics.*Emissions emissions}. SOAs are the result of chemical reactions of non-methane hydrocarbons (and their products) with the hydroxyl radical (OH), {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}, nitrate (NO3) or photolysis ({cite.8.'Hallquist_et_al_2009}). Thus although many hydrocarbons in the atmosphere are of biogenic origin, {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} pollutants can have impacts on their conversion to SOAs. There is tremendous complexity and still much {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the processes involved in the formation of SOAs ({cite.8.'Hallquist_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Carslaw_et_al_2010}). Additional information can be found in {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_2 Section 7.3.2}.

Once generated, the size and composition of aerosol particles can be modified by additional chemical reactions, condensation or evaporation of gaseous species and coagulation ({cite.8.'Seinfeld_and_Pandis_2006}). It is this set of processes that defines their physical, chemical and optical properties, and hence their impact on radiation and clouds, with large regional and global differences (see {Chapters.7.7_3.7_3_3 Section 7.3.3}). Furthermore, their distribution is affected by transport and deposition, defining a residence time in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} of usually a few days ({cite.8.'Textor_et_al_2006}).
