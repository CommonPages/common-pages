title: 8.2.3.2 - Stratospheric Ozone and Water Vapour

Stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} has experienced significant depletion since the 1960s due to bromine and chlorine-containing compounds ({cite.8.'Solomon_1999}), leading to an estimated global decrease of stratospheric ozone of 5% between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the decrease being largest over Antarctica ({cite.8.'Fioletov_et_al_2002}). Most of the ozone loss is associated with the long-lived bromine and chlorine-containing compounds (chlorofluorocarbons and substitutes) released by {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities}, in addition to {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}. This is in addition to a background level of natural {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of short-lived halogens from oceanic and volcanic sources.

With the advent of the {Glossary.*Montreal_Protocol Montreal Protocol} and its amendments, emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and replacements have strongly declined ({cite.8.'Montzka_et_al_2011}), and signs of ozone stabilization and even possibly recovery have already occurred ({cite.8.'Mader_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Salby_et_al_2012}). A further consequence is that N2O emissions ({Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_3.8_2_3_4 Section 8.2.3.4}) likely dominate all other emissions in terms of ozone-depleting potential ({cite.8.'Ravishankara_et_al_2009}). Chemistry-{Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} with resolved stratospheric chemistry and dynamics recently {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} an estimated global mean total ozone column recovery to 1980 levels to occur in 2032 (multi-model mean value, with a range of 2024 to 2042) under the A1B scenario ({cite.8.'Eyring_et_al_2010a}). Increases in the stratospheric burden and acceleration of the stratospheric circulation leads to an increase in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}–{Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} flux of ozone (Shindell et al., 2006c; {cite.8.'Grewe_2007}; {cite.8.'Hegglin_and_Shepherd_2009}; {cite.8.'Zeng_et_al_2010}). This is also seen in recent {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} simulations, with the impact of increasing tropospheric burden ({cite.8.'Kawase_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Lamarque_et_al_2011}). However, observationally based estimates of recent trends in age of air ({cite.8.'Engel_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Stiller_et_al_2012}) do not appear to be consistent with the acceleration of the stratospheric circulation found in model simulations, possibly owing to inherent difficulties with extracting trends from SF6 observations ({cite.8.'Garcia_et_al_2011}).

Oxidation of {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4} in the stratosphere (see {Chapters.8.8_2.8_2_3.8_2_3_3 Section 8.2.3.3}) is a significant {Glossary.*Source source} of water vapour and hence the long-term increase in CH4 leads to an {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} (see {Chapters.8.8_3 Section 8.3}) in the stratosphere. Stratospheric water vapour abundance increased by an average of 1.0 ± 0.2 (1-σ) ppm during 1980–2010, with CH4 oxidation explaining approximately 25% of this increase ({cite.8.'Hurst_et_al_2011}). Other factors contributing to the long-term change in water vapour include changes in tropical {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} temperatures (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_2.2_2_2_1 Section 2.2.2.1}).
