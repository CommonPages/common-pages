title: 8.2.3.4 - Nitrous Oxide

Nitrous oxide ({Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}) in 2011 has a surface concentration 19% above its 1750 level (Sections {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_1.2_2_1_1.2_2_1_1_3 2.2.1.1.3} and {Chapters.8.8_3.8_3_2.8_3_2_3 8.3.2.3}). Increases in N2O lead to depletion of midto upper-stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and increase in mid-latitude lower stratospheric ozone (as a result of increased photolysis rate from decreased ozone above). This impacts tropospheric chemistry through increase in {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}–{Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} exchange of ozone and odd nitrogen species and increase in tropospheric photolysis rates and OH formation ({cite.8.'Prather_and_Hsu_2010}). {Glossary.*Anthropogenic Anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} represent around 30 to 45% of the present-day global total, and are mostly from agricultural and soil sources ({cite.8.'Fowler_et_al_2009}) and fossil-fuel activities. Natural emissions come mostly from microbial activity in the soil. The main {Glossary.*Sink sink} for N2O is through photolysis and oxidation reactions in the stratosphere, leading to an estimated {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of 131 ± 10 years ({cite.8.'Prather_et_al_2012}), slightly larger than previous estimates ({cite.8.'Prather_and_Hsu_2010}; {cite.8.'Montzka_et_al_2011}). The addition of N2O to the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} changes its own lifetime through feedbacks that couple N2O to stratospheric NOy and ozone depletion ({cite.8.'Prather_1998}; {cite.8.'Ravishankara_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Prather_and_Hsu_2010}), so that the lifetime of a perturbation is less than that of the total burden, 121 ± 10 years (1-σ; {cite.8.'Prather_et_al_2012}) and is used in calculations of metrics ({Chapters.8.8_7 Section 8.7}).
