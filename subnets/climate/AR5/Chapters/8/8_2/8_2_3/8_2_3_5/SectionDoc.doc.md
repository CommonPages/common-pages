title: 8.2.3.5 - Halogenated Species

Halogenated species can be powerful greenhouse gases ({Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}). Those containing chlorine and bromine also deplete stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} and are referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Most of those compounds do not have natural {Topics.*Emissions emissions} and, because of the implementation of the {Glossary.*Montreal_Protocol Montreal Protocol} and its amendments, total emissions of ODSs have sharply decreased since the 1990s ({cite.8.'Montzka_et_al_2011}). For CFCs, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and SF6 the main loss is through photolysis in the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}. The {Glossary.*CFC CFC} substitutes (hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)) are destroyed by OH oxidation in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}. Their global concentration has steadily risen over the recent past (see {Chapters.2.2_2.2_2_1.2_2_1_1.2_2_1_1_4 Section 2.2.1.1.4}).
