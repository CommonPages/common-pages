title: Box 8.4 - Choices Required When Using Emission Metrics

Time frames: One can apply a backward-looking (i.e., historical) or a forward-looking perspective on the responses to {Topics.*Emissions emissions}. In the forward-looking case one may use pulses of emissions, sustained emissions or emission {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. All choices of emission perturbations are somewhat artificial and idealized, and different choices serve different purposes. One may use the level (e.g., degrees Celsius) or rate of change (e.g., degrees Celsius per decade). Furthermore, the effects of emissions may be estimated at a particular time or be integrated over time up to a chosen time horizon. Alternatively, discounting of future effects may be introduced (i.e., a weighting of effects over time).

Type of effect or end-point: {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing Radiative forcing}, temperature change or {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change}, for example, could be examined ({'Figure_8_27 Figure 8.27}). Metrics may also include eco/biological or socioeconomic damages. The choice of climate impact parameters is related to which aspects of climate change are considered relevant for interpretation of ‘dangerous {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} interference with the climate system’ ({Glossary.*United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change UNFCCC} Article 2).

Spatial dimension for emission and response: Equal-mass emissions of NTCFs from different regions can induce varying global mean climate responses, and the {Glossary.*Climate_response climate response} also has a regional component irrespective of the regional variation in emissions. Thus, metrics may be given for {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of emission as well as region of response.

Some of the choices involved in metrics are scientific (e.g., type of model, and how processes are included or parameterized in the models). Choices of time frames and climate impact are policy-related and cannot be based on science alone, but scientific studies can be used to analyse different approaches and policy choices.
