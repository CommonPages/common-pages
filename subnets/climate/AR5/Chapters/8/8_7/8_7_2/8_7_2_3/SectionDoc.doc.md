title: 8.7.2.3 - Impact by Emitted Component

We now use the metrics evaluated here to estimate climate impacts of various components (in a forward looking perspective). {'Figure_8_32 Figure 8.32} shows global {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of some selected components weighted by the {Glossary.*Global_Warming_Potential GWP} and GTP. The time horizons are chosen as examples and illustrate how the perceived impacts of components—relative to the impact of the reference gas—vary strongly as function of impact parameter (integrated {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} in GWP or end-point temperature in GTP) and with time horizon.

We may also calculate the temporal development of the temperature responses to pulse or sustained emissions using the AGTP {Glossary.*Metric metric}. {'Figure_8_33 Figure 8.33} shows that for a one-year pulse the impacts of {Glossary.*Near_term_climate_forcers NTCF} decay quickly owing to their atmospheric adjustment times even if effects are prolonged due to climate {Glossary.*Adjustment_time_or_response_time_Ta response time} (in the case of constant emissions the effects reach approximately constant levels since the emissions are replenished each year, except for {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2}, which has a fraction remaining in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} on time scales of centuries). {'Figure_8_33 Figure 8.33} also shows how some components have strong short-lived effects of both signs while CO2 has a weaker initial effect but one that persists to create a long-lived warming effect. Note that there are large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} related to the metric values (as discussed in {Chapters.8.8_7.8_7_1.8_7_1_4 Section 8.7.1.4}); especially for the NTCFs.

These examples show that the outcome of comparisons of effects of emissions depends strongly on choice of time horizon and metric type. Such end-user choices will have a strong influence on the calculated contributions from NTCFs versus {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs} or non-CO2 versus CO2 emissions. Thus, each specific analysis should use a design chosen in light of the context and questions being asked.
