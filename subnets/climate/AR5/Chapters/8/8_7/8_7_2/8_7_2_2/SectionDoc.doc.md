title: 8.7.2.2 - Metrics for Near-Term Climate Forcers

The {Glossary.*Global_Warming_Potential GWP} concept was initially used for the {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}, but later for NTCFs as well. There are, however, substantial challenges related to calculations of GWP (and GTP) values for these components, which is reflected in the large ranges of values in the literature. Below we present and assess the current status of knowledge and quantification of metrics for various NTCFs.
