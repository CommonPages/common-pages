title: 8.7.2.2.4 - Summary of status of metrics for near-term climate forcers

The metrics provide a format for comparing the magnitudes of the various {Topics.*Emissions emissions} as well as for comparing effects of emissions from different regions. They can also be used for comparing results from different studies. Much of the spread in results is due to differences in experimental design and how the models treat physical and chemical processes. Unlike most of the {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect WMGHGs}, many of the NTCFs are tightly coupled to the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric chemistry, leading to a much larger spread in results as these are highly complex processes that are difficult to validate on the requisite small spatial and short temporal scales. The confidence level is lower for many of the {Glossary.*Near_term_climate_forcers NTCF} compared to {Glossary.*Well_mixed_greenhouse_gas WMGHG} and much lower where {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol}–cloud interactions are important (see {Chapters.8.8_5.8_5_1 Section 8.5.1}). There are particular difficulties for NOX, because the net impact is a small residual of opposing effects with quite different spatial distributions and temporal behaviour. Although climate–carbon feedbacks for non-{Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} emissions have not been included in the NTCF metrics (other than {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}) presented here, they can greatly increase those values ({cite.8.'Collins_et_al_2013}) and likely provide more realistic results.
