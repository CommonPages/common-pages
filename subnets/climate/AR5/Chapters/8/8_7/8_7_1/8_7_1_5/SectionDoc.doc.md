title: 8.7.1.5 - New Metric Concepts

New {Glossary.*Metric metric} concepts have been developed both to modify physical metrics to address shortcomings as well as to replace them with metrics that account for economic dimensions of problems to which metrics are applied. Modifications to physical metrics have been proposed to better represent {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} emissions from bioenergy, regional patterns of response, and for peak temperature limits.

{Topics.*Emissions Emissions} of CO2 from the combustion of {Glossary.*Biomass biomass} for energy in national emission inventories are currently assumed to have no net RF, based on the assumption that these emissions are compensated by biomass regrowth ({cite.8.'IPCC_1996}). However, there is a time lag between combustion and regrowth, and while the CO2 is resident in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} it leads to an additional RF. Modifications of the {Glossary.*Global_Warming_Potential GWP} and GTP for bioenergy (GWPbio, GTPbio) have been developed ({cite.8.'Cherubini_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Cherubini_et_al_2012}). The GWPbio give values generally between zero (current default for bioenergy) and one (current for {Glossary.*Fossil_fuel_emissions fossil fuel emissions}) ({cite.8.'Cherubini_et_al_2011}), and negative values are possible for GTPbio due to the fast time scale of atmospheric–ocean CO2 exchange relative to the growth cycle of biomass ({cite.8.'Cherubini_et_al_2012}). GWPbio and GTPbio have been used in only a few applications, and more research is needed to assess their robustness and applicability. Metrics for biogeophysical effects, such as {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} changes, have been proposed ({cite.8.'Betts_2000}; {cite.8.'Rotenberg_and_Yakir_2010}) , but as for NTCFs regional variations are important ({cite.8.'Claussen_et_al_2001}) and the RF concept may not be adequate ({cite.8.'Davin_et_al_2007}).

New concepts have also been developed to capture information about regional patterns of responses and cancelling effects that are lost when global mean metrics are used. The use of nonlinear damage functions to capture information on the spatial pattern of responses has been explored ({cite.8.'Shine_et_al_2005b}; {cite.8.'Lund_et_al_2012}). In addition, the Absolute Regional Temperature Potential (ARTP) ({cite.8.'Shindell_2012}; {cite.8.'Collins_et_al_2013}) has been developed to provide estimates of impacts at a sub-global scale. ARTP gives the time-dependent temperature response in four latitude bands as a function of the regional {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} imposed in all bands. These metrics, as well as new regional precipitation metrics ({cite.8.'Shindell_et_al_2012b}), require additional studies to determine their robustness.

Alternatives to the single basket approach adopted by the {Glossary.*Kyoto_Protocol Kyoto Protocol} are a component-by-component approach or a multi-basket approach ({cite.8.'Rypdal_et_al_2005}; {cite.8.'Daniel_et_al_2012}; {cite.8.'Sarofim_2012}; {cite.8.'Jackson_2009}). {cite.8.'Smith_et_al_2012 Smith et al. (2012)} show how peak temperature change is constrained by cumulative emissions (see 12.5.4) for gases with long lifetimes and emissions rates for shorter-lived gases (including {Glossary.*Methane_CH4 CH4}). Thus, they divide gases into two baskets and present two metrics that can be used for estimating peak temperature for various emission {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. This division of gases into the two baskets is sensitive to the time of peak temperature in the different scenarios. The approach uses time invariant metrics that do not account for the timing of emissions relative to the target year. The choice of time horizon is implicit in the scenario assumed and this approach works only for a peak scenario.

A number of new metrics have been developed to add economic dimensions to purely physically based metrics such as the GWP and GTP. The use of physical metrics in policy contexts has been criticized by economists ({cite.8.'Reilly_and_Richards_1993}; {cite.8.'Schmalensee_1993}; {cite.8.'Hammitt_et_al_1996}; {cite.8.'Reilly_et_al_1999}; {cite.8.'Bradford_2001}; De Cara et al., 2008). A prominent use of metrics is to set relative prices of gases when implementing a multi-gas policy. Once a particular policy has been agreed on, economic metrics can address policy goals more directly than physical metrics by accounting not only for physical dimensions but also for economic dimensions such as {Glossary.*Mitigation mitigation} costs, damage costs and discount rates (see WGIII, {Chapters.3 Chapter 3}; {cite.8.'Deuber_et_al_2013}).

For example, if mitigation policy is set within a cost-effectiveness framework with the aim of making the least cost mix of emissions reductions across components to meet a global temperature target, the ‘price ratio’ ({cite.8.'Manne_and_Richels_2001}), also called the Global Cost Potential (GCP) ({cite.8.'Tol_et_al_2012}), most directly addresses the goal. The choice of target is a policy decision; metric values can then be calculated based on an agreed upon target. Similarly, if policy is set within a cost–benefit framework, the metric that directly addresses the policy goal is the ratio of the marginal damages from the emission of a gas (i.e., the damage costs to society resulting from an incremental increase in emissions) relative to the marginal damages of an emission of CO2, known as the Global Damage Potential (GDP) (Kandlikar, 1995). Both types of metrics are typically determined within an integrated climate– economy model, since they are affected both by the response of the climate system as well as by economic factors.

If other indexes, such as the GWP, are used instead of an economic cost-minimizing index, costs to society will increase. Cost implications at the project or country level could be substantial under some circumstances ({cite.8.'Godal_and_Fuglestvedt_2002}; {cite.8.'Shine_2009}; {cite.8.'Reisinger_et_al_2013}). However, under idealized conditions of full participation in mitigation policy, the increase is relatively small at the global level, particularly when compared to the cost savings resulting from a multi(as opposed to single-) gas mitigation strategy even when based on an imperfect metric (O’Neill, 2003; {cite.8.'Aaheim_et_al_2006}; {cite.8.'Johansson_et_al_2006}; {cite.8.'Johansson_2012}; {cite.8.'Reisinger_et_al_2013}; {cite.8.'Smith_et_al_2013}).

Purely physical metrics continue to be used in many contexts due at least in part to the added {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in mitigation and damage costs, and therefore in the values of economic metrics ({cite.8.'Boucher_2012}). Efforts have been made to view purely physical metrics such as GWPs and GTPs as approximations of economic indexes. GTPs, for example, can be interpreted as an approximation of a Global Cost Potential designed for use in a cost-effectiveness setting ({cite.8.'Shine_et_al_2007}; {cite.8.'Tol_et_al_2012}). Quantitative values for time-dependent GTPs reproduce in broad terms several features of the Global Cost Potential such as the rising value of metrics for short-lived gases as a climate policy target is approached ({cite.8.'Tanaka_et_al_2013}). {'Figure_8_30 Figure 8.30} shows how contributions of {Glossary.*Nitrous_oxide_N2O N2O}, CH4 and {Glossary.*Black_carbon BC} to warming in the target year changes over time. The contributions are given relative to CO2 and show the effects of emission occurring at various times. Similarly, GWPs can be interpreted as approximations of the Global Damage Potential designed for a cost–benefit framework ({cite.8.'Tol_et_al_2012}). These interpretations of the GTP and GWP imply that using even a purely physical metric in an economic policy context involves an implicit economic valuation.

In both cases, a number of simplifying assumptions must be made for these approximations to hold ({cite.8.'Tol_et_al_2012}). For example, in the case of the GWP, the influence of emissions on RF, and therefore implicitly on costs to society, beyond the time horizon is not taken into account, and there are substantial numerical differences between GWP and GDP values ({cite.8.'Marten_and_Newbold_2012}). In the case of the GTP, the influence of emissions on temperature change (and costs) is included only at the time the target is reached, but not before nor after. Other metrics have been developed to more closely approximate GCPs or GDPs. The Cost-Effective Temperature Potential (CETP) reproduces values of the GCP more closely than does the GTP ({cite.8.'Johansson_2012}). It is similar to the GTP but accounts for post-target temperature effects based on an assumption about how to value costs beyond the time the target is reached. Metrics have also been proposed that take into account forcing or temperature effects that result from emissions trajectories over broad time spans, and that behave similarly to GCP and GTP ({cite.8.'Tanaka_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Manning_and_Reisinger_2011}) or to GWP (e.g., O’Neill, 2000; {cite.8.'Peters_et_al_2011a}; {cite.8.'Gillett_and_Matthews_2010}; {cite.8.'Azar_and_Johansson_2012}).
