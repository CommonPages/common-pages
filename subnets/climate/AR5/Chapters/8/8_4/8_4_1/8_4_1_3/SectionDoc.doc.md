title: 8.4.1.3 - Attempts to Estimate Future Centennial Trends of Total Solar Irradiance

Cosmogenic isotope and sunspot data ({cite.8.'Rigozo_et_al_2001}; {cite.8.'Solanki_and_Krivova_2004}; {cite.8.'Abreu_et_al_2008}) reveal that currently the Sun is in a grand activity maximum that began about 1920 (20th century grand maximum). However, SC 23 showed an activity decline not previously seen in the satellite era ({cite.8.'McComas_et_al_2008}; {cite.8.'Smith_and_Balogh_2008}; {cite.8.'Russell_et_al_2010}). Most current estimations suggest that the forthcoming solar cycles will have lower {Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} than those for the past 30 years ({cite.8.'Abreu_et_al_2008}; {cite.8.'Lockwood_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Rigozo_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Russell_et_al_2010}). Also there are indications that the mean magnetic field in {Glossary.*Sunspots sunspots} may be diminishing on decadal level. A linear expansion of the current {Glossary.*Trend trend} may indicate that of the order of half the sunspot activity may disappear by about 2015 ({cite.8.'Penn_and_Livingston_2006}). These studies only suggest that the Sun may have left the 20th century grand maximum and not that it is entering another grand minimum. But other works propose a grand minimum during the 21st century, estimating an RF within a range of -0.16 to 0.12 W mâ€“2 between this future minimum and the present-day TSI ({cite.8.'Jones_et_al_2012}). However, much more evidence is needed and at present there is very low confidence concerning future solar {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} estimates.

Nevertheless, even if there is such decrease in the {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity}, there is a high confidence that the TSI RF variations will be much smaller in magnitude than the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} increased forcing due to GHG (see {Chapters.12.12_3.12_3_1 Section 12.3.1}).
