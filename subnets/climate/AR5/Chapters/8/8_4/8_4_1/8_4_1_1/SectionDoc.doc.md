title: 8.4.1.1 - Satellite Measurements of Total Solar Irradiance

Total solar irradiance ({Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI}) measured by the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on the spaceborne Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) is 1360.8 ± 0.5 W m–2 during 2008 ({cite.8.'Kopp_and_Lean_2011}) which is ~4.5 W m–2 lower than the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD) TSI composite during 2008 ({cite.8.'Frohlich_2009}).The difference is probably due to instrumental biases in measurements prior to TIM. Measurements with the PREcision MOnitor Sensor (PREMOS) instrument support the TIM absolute values ({cite.8.'Kopp_and_Lean_2011}). The TIM calibration is also better linked to national standards which provides further support that it is the most accurate (see Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6). Given the lower TIM TSI values relative to currently used standards, most {Glossary.*General_circulation general circulation} models are calibrated to incorrectly high values. However, the few tenths of a percent bias in the absolute TSI value has minimal consequences for climate simulations because the larger {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in cloud properties have a greater effect on the radiative balance. As the maximum-to-minimum TSI relative change is well-constrained from observations, and historical variations are calculated as changes relative to modern values, a revision of the absolute value of TSI affects {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} by the same fraction as it affects TSI. The downward revision of TIM TSI with respect to PMOD, being 0.3%, thus has a negligible impact on RF, which is given with a relative uncertainty of several tenths of a percent.

Since 1978, several independent space-based instruments have directly measured the TSI. Three main composite series were constructed, referred to as the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) ({cite.8.'Willson_and_Mordvinov_2003}), the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB) ({cite.8.'Dewitte_et_al_2004}) and the PMOD ({cite.8.'Frohlich_2006}) series. There are two major differences between ACRIM and PMOD. The first is the rapid drift in calibration between PMOD and ACRIM before 1981. This arises because both composites employ the Hickey– Frieden (HF) radiometer data for this interval, while a re-evaluation of the early HF degradation has been implemented by PMOD but not by ACRIM. The second one, involving also RMIB, is the bridging of the gap between the end of ACRIM I (mid-1989) and the beginning of ACRIM II (late 1991) observations, as it is possible that a change in HF data occurred during this gap. This possibility is neglected in ACRIM and thus its TSI increases by more than 0.5 W m–2 during {Glossary.*Solar_11_year_cycle solar cycle} (SC) 22. These differences lead to different long-term TSI trends in the three composites (see {'Figure_8_10 Figure 8.10}): ACRIM rises until 1996 and subsequently declines, RMIB has an upward {Glossary.*Trend trend} through 2008 and PMOD shows a decline since 1986 which unlike the other two composites, follows the solar-cycle-averaged sunspot number ({cite.8.'Lockwood_2010}). Moreover, the ACRIM trend implies that the TSI on time scales longer than the SC is positively correlated with the cosmic ray variation indicating a decline in TSI throughout most of the 20th century (the opposite to most TSI reconstructions produced to date; see {Chapters.8.8_4.8_4_1.8_4_1_2 Section 8.4.1.2}). Furthermore, extrapolating the ACRIM TSI long-term drift would imply a brighter Sun in the Maunder minimum (MM) than now, again opposite to most TSI reconstructions ({cite.8.'Lockwood_and_Frohlich_2008}). Finally, analysis of instrument degradation and pointing issues (Lee et al., 1995) and independent modeling based on solar magnetograms ({cite.8.'Wenzler_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Ball_et_al_2012}), confirm the need for correction of HF data, and we conclude that PMOD is more accurate than the other composites.

TSI variations of approximately 0.1% were observed between the maximum and minimum of the 11-year SC in the three composites mentioned above ({cite.8.'Kopp_and_Lean_2011}). This variation is mainly due to an interplay between relatively dark {Glossary.*Sunspots sunspots}, bright faculae and bright network elements (Foukal and Lean, 1988; see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1.5_2_1_2 Section 5.2.1.2}). A declining trend since 1986 in PMOD solar minima is evidenced in {'Figure_8_10 Figure 8.10}. Considering the PMOD solar minima values of 1986 and 2008, the RF is –0.04 W m–2. Our assessment of the uncertainty range of changes in TSI between 1986 and 2008 is –0.08 to 0.0 W m–2 and thus very likely negative, and includes the uncertainty in the PMOD data ({cite.8.'Frohlich_2009}; see Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6) but is extended to also take into account the uncertainty of combining the satellite data.

For incorporation of TIM data with the previous and overlapping data, in {'Figure_8_10 Figure 8.10} we have standardized the composite time series to the TIM series (over 2003–2012, the procedure is explained in Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6. Moreover as we consider annual averages, ACRIM and PMOD start at 1979 because for 1978 both composites have only two months of data.
