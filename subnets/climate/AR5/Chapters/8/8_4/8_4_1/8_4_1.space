  |{Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} variations of approximately 0.1% were observed between the maximum and minimum of the 11-year Solar Cycle. The best estimate from our assessment of the most reliable TSI {Glossary.*Reconstruction_of_climate_variable reconstruction} gives a 7-year running mean {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing RF} between the minima of 1745 and 2008 of 0.05 W mâ€“2. The RF and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} range have been obtained in a different way in AR5 compared to {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, and is almost half of that in AR4.
