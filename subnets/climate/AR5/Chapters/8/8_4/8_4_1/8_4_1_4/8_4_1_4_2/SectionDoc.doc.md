title: 8.4.1.4.2 - Measurements of spectral irradiance

Solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variations in the far (120 to 200 nm) and middle (200 to 300 nm) ultraviolet (UV) are the primary driver for heating, composition, and dynamic changes of the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere}, and although these wavelengths compose a small portion of the incoming radiation they show large relative variations between the maximum and minimum of the SC compared to the corresponding {Glossary.*Total_solar_irradiance TSI} changes. As UV heating of the stratosphere over a SC has the potential to influence the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} indirectly, through dynamic coupling, and therefore climate ({cite.8.'Haigh_1996}; {cite.8.'Gray_et_al_2010}), the UV may have a more significant impact on climate than changes in TSI alone would suggest. Although this indicates that metrics based only on TSI are not appropriate, UV measurements present several controversial issues and modelling is not yet robust.

Multiple space-based measurements made in the past 30 years indicated that UV variations account for about 30% of the SC TSI variations, while about 70% were produced within the visible and infrared ({cite.8.'Rottman_2006}). However, current models and data provide the range of 30 to 90% for the contribution of the UV variability below 400 nm to TSI changes ({cite.8.'Ermolli_et_al_2013}), with a more probable value of ~60% ({cite.8.'Morrill_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Ermolli_et_al_2013}). The Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) on board SORCE ({cite.8.'Harder_et_al_2009}) shows, over the SC 23 declining phase, measurements that are rather inconsistent with prior understanding, indicating that additional validation and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} estimates are needed ({cite.8.'DeLand_and_Cebula_2012}; {cite.8.'Lean_and_Deland_2012}). A wider exposition can be found in Supplementary Material Section 8.SM.6.
