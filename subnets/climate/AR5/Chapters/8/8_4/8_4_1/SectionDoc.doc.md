title: 8.4.1 - Solar Irradiance

In earlier IPCC reports the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} was estimated as the instantaneous RF at TOA. However, due to wavelength-{Glossary.*Albedo albedo} dependence, {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation}-wavelength dependence and absorption within the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} and the resulting stratospheric adjustment, the RF is reduced to about 78% of the TOA instantaneous RF ({cite.8.'Gray_et_al_2009}). There is low confidence in the exact value of this number, which can be model and time scale dependent ({cite.8.'Gregory_et_al_2004}; {cite.8.'Hansen_et_al_2005}). {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} gives an 11-year running mean instantaneous TOA RF between 1750 and the present of 0.12 W m–2 with a range of estimates of 0.06 to 0.30 W m–2, equivalent to a RF of 0.09 W m–2 with a range of 0.05 to 0.23 W m–2. For a consistent treatment of all forcing agents, hereafter we use RF while numbers quoted from AR4 will be provided both as RF and instantaneous RF at TOA.
