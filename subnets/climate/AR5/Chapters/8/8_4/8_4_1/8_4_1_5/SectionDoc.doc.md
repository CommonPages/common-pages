title: 8.4.1.5 - The Effects of Cosmic Rays on Clouds

Changing cloud amount or properties modify the Earth’s {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} and therefore affect climate. It has been hypothesized that cosmic ray flux create atmospheric ions which facilitates {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} nucleation and new particle formation with a further impact on cloud formation (Dickinson, 1975; {cite.8.'Kirkby_2007}). High {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity} means a stronger heliospheric magnetic field and thus a more efficient screen against cosmic rays. Under the hypothesis underlined above, the reduced cosmic ray flux would promote fewer clouds amplifying the warming effect expected from high solar activity. There is evidence from laboratory, field and modelling studies that ionization from cosmic ray flux may enhance aerosol nucleation in the free {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({cite.8.'Merikanto_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Mirme_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Kirkby_et_al_2011}). However, there is high confidence (medium evidence and high agreement) that the cosmic ray– ionization mechanism is too weak to influence global concentrations of {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei cloud condensation nuclei} or their change over the last century or during a SC in a climatically significant way ({cite.8.'Harrison_and_Ambaum_2010}; {cite.8.'Erlykin_and_Wolfendale_2011}; Snow-Kropla et al., 2011). A detailed exposition is found in {Chapters.7.7_4.7_4_6 Section 7.4.6}.
