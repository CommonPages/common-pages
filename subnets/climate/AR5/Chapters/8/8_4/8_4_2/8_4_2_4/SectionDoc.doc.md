title: 8.4.2.4 - Future Effects

We expect large eruptions over the next century but cannot predict when. {cite.8.'Ammann_and_Naveau_2003 Ammann and Naveau (2003)} and {cite.8.'Stothers_2007 Stothers (2007)} suggested an 80-year periodicity in past eruptions, but the data record is quite short and imperfect, and there is no mechanism proposed that would cause this. While the period 1912–1963 was unusual for the past 500 years in having no large volcanic eruptions, and the period 1250–1300 had the most globally climatically significant eruptions in the past 1500 years ({cite.8.'Gao_et_al_2008}), current knowledge only allows us to predict such periods on a statistical basis, assuming that the recent past distributions are stationary. {cite.8.'Ammann_and_Naveau_2003 Ammann and Naveau (2003)}, {cite.8.'Gusev_2008 Gusev (2008)}, and {cite.8.'Deligne_et_al_2010 Deligne et al. (2010)} studied these statistical properties and {cite.8.'Ammann_and_Naveau_2010 Ammann and Naveau (2010)} showed how they could be used to produce a statistical distribution for future simulations. Although the future {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} from volcanic eruptions will depend only on the stratospheric {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} loading for most forcing mechanisms, the future effects on reducing {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} will diminish as ozone depleting substances diminish in the future ({cite.8.'Eyring_et_al_2010b}).
