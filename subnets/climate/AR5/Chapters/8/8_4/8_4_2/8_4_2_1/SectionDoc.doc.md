title: 8.4.2.1 - Introduction

Volcanic eruptions that inject substantial amounts of SO2 gas into the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} are the dominant natural cause of externally forced climate change on the annual and multi-decadal time scales, both because of the multi-decadal variability of eruptions and the time scale of the climate system response, and can explain much of the pre-industrial climate change of the last millennium ({cite.8.'Schneider_et_al_2009}; {cite.8.'Brovkin_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Legras_et_al_2010}; {cite.8.'Miller_et_al_2012}). Although volcanic eruptions inject both mineral particles (called ash or tephra) and sulphate {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} precursor gases (predominantly SO2) into the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, it is the sulphate aerosols, which because of their small size are effective scatterers of sunlight and have long lifetimes, that are responsible for RF important for climate. Global annually averaged {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} from volcanic eruptions since 1750 have been at least 100 times smaller than {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} emissions and inconsequential for climate on millennial and shorter time scales ({cite.8.'Gerlach_2011}). To be important for climate change, sulphur must be injected into the stratosphere, as the {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of aerosols in the {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} is only about one week, whereas sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere from tropical eruptions have a lifetime of about one year, and those from high-latitude eruptions last several months. Most stratospheric aerosols are from explosive eruptions that directly put sulphur into the stratosphere, but Bourassa et al. (2012, 2013) showed that sulphur injected into the upper troposphere can then be lifted into the stratosphere over the next month or two by deep {Glossary.*Convection convection} and large scale Asian summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} circulation, although {cite.8.'Vernier_et_al_2013 Vernier et al. (2013)} and {cite.8.'Fromm_et_al_2013 Fromm et al. (2013)} suggested that direct injection was also important. {cite.8.'Robock_2000 Robock (2000)}, {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2007}) and {cite.8.'Timmreck_2012 Timmreck (2012)} provide summaries of this relatively well understood {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} agent.

There have been no major volcanic eruptions since Mt Pinatubo in 1991 ({'Figure_8_12 Figure 8.12}), but several smaller eruptions have caused a RF for the years 2008–2011 of –0.11 (–0.15 to –0.08) W m–2, approximately twice the magnitude of the 1999–2002 RF of –0.06 (–0.08 to –0.04) W m–2, consistent with the trends noted in {cite.8.'Solomon_et_al_2011 Solomon et al. (2011)}. However, the CMIP5 simulations discussed elsewhere in this report did not include the recent small volcanic forcing in their calculations. New work has also produced a better understanding of high latitude eruptions, the hydrological response to volcanic eruptions ({cite.8.'Trenberth_and_Dai_2007}; {cite.8.'Anchukaitis_et_al_2010}), better long-term records of past volcanism and better understanding of the effects of very large eruptions.

There are several ways to measure both the SO2 precursor and sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere, using balloons, airplanes, and both groundand satellite-based remote sensing. Both the infrared and ultraviolet signals sensed by satellite instruments can measure SO2, and stratospheric aerosol measurements by space-based sensors have been made on a continuous basis since 1978 by a number of instruments employing solar and stellar occultation, limb scattering, limb emission, and lidar strategies ({cite.8.'Thomason_and_Peter_2006}; {cite.8.'Kravitz_et_al_2011}; {cite.8.'Solomon_et_al_2011}).

{cite.8.'Forster_et_al_2007 Forster et al. (2007)} described four mechanisms by which volcanic forcing influences climate: RF due to {Glossary.*Aerosol_radiation_interaction aerosol–radiation interaction}; differential (vertical or horizontal) heating, producing gradients and changes in circulation; interactions with other modes of circulation, such as El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}); and {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} depletion with its effects on stratospheric heating, which depends on anthropogenic chlorine (stratospheric ozone would increase with a volcanic eruption under low-chlorine conditions). In addition, the enhanced diffuse light from volcanic aerosol clouds impacts vegetation and hence the {Topics.*Carbon_Cycle carbon cycle} ({cite.8.'Mercado_et_al_2009}) and {Glossary.*Aerosol_cloud_interaction aerosol–cloud interaction} of sulphate aerosols on clouds in the troposphere can also be important ({cite.8.'Schmidt_et_al_2010}), though {cite.8.'Frolicher_et_al_2011 Frolicher et al. (2011)} showed that the impacts of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption on the carbon cycle were small.
