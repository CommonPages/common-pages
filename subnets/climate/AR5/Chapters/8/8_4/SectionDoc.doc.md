title: 8.4 - Natural Radiative Forcing Changes: Solar and Volcanic

Several natural drivers of climate change operate on multiple time scales. Solar variability takes place at many time scales that include centennial and millennial scales ({cite.8.'Helama_et_al_2010}), as the radiant energy output of the Sun changes. Also, variations in the astronomical alignment of the Sun and the Earth (Milankovitch cycles) induce cyclical changes in RF, but this is substantial only at millennial and longer time scales (see {Chapters.5.5_2.5_2_1.5_2_1_1 Section 5.2.1.1}). Volcanic forcing is highly episodic, but can have dramatic, rapid impacts on climate. No major asteroid impacts occurred during the reference period (1750â€“2012) and thus this effect is not considered here. This section discusses solar and volcanic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}, the two dominant natural contributors of climate change since the pre-industrial time.
