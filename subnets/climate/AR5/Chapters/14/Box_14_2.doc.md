title: Box 14.2 - Blocking

Atmospheric blocking is associated with persistent, slow-moving high-pressure systems that interrupt the prevailing westerly winds of middle and high latitudes and the normal eastward progress of extratropical storm systems. Overall, blocking activity is more frequent at the exit zones of the jet stream and shows appreciable seasonal variability in both hemispheres, reaching a maximum in winter– spring and a minimum in summer–autumn (e.g., {cite.14.'Wiedenmann_et_al_2002}). In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the preferred locations for winter blocking are the North Atlantic and North Pacific, whereas continental blocks are relatively more frequent in summer ({cite.14.'Tyrlis_and_Hoskins_2008}; {cite.14.'Barriopedro_et_al_2010}). Southern Hemisphere (SH) blocking is less frequent than in the NH, and it tends to be concentrated over the Southeast Pacific and the Indian Ocean ({cite.14.'Berrisford_et_al_2007}).

{Glossary.*Blocking Blocking} is a complex phenomenon that involves largeand small-scale components of the atmospheric circulation, and their mutual interactions. Although there is not a widely accepted blocking theory, transient eddy activity is considered to play an important role in blocking occurrence and maintenance through feedbacks between the large-scale flow and synoptic eddies (e.g., {cite.14.'Yamazaki_and_Itoh_2009}).

Blocking is an important component of intraseasonal variability in the extratropics and causes climate anomalies over large areas of Europe ({cite.14.'Trigo_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Masato_et_al_2012}), North America ({cite.14.'Carrera_et_al_2004}), East Asia (e.g., {cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Cheung_et_al_2012}), high-latitude regions of the SH ({cite.14.'Mendes_et_al_2008}) and Antarctica ({cite.14.'Massom_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Scarchilli_et_al_2011}). Blocking can also be responsible for {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} (e.g., {cite.14.'Buehler_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Pfahl_and_Wernli_2012}), such as cold spells in winter (e.g., 2008 in China, Zhou et al., 2009d; or 2010 in Europe, Cattiaux, 2010) and summer heat waves in the NH (e.g., 2010 in Russia, {cite.14.'Matsueda_2011}; {cite.14.'Lupo_et_al_2012}) and in southern Australia ({cite.14.'Pezza_et_al_2008}).

At interannual time scales, there are statistically significant relationships between blocking activity and several dominant modes of atmospheric variability, such as the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_1 Section 14.5.1}) and wintertime blocking in the Euro-Atlantic sector (Croci-Maspoli et al., 2007a; {cite.14.'Luo_et_al_2010}), the winter {Glossary.*Pacific_North_American_pattern PNA} ({Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_1 Section 14.7.1}) and blocking frequency in the North Pacific (Croci-Maspoli et al., 2007a), or the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}) and winter blocking activity near the New Zealand sector ({cite.14.'Berrisford_et_al_2007}). Multi-decadal variability in winter blocking over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific seem to be related, respectively, with the Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation Meridional Overturning Circulation} (AMOC; Häkkinen et al., 2011; {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_6 Section 14.7.6}) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}; {cite.14.'Chen_and_Yoon_2002}; {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_3 Section 14.7.3}), although this remains an open question.

Other important scientific issues related to the blocking phenomenon include the mechanisms of blocking onset and maintenance, twoway interactions between blocking and stratospheric processes (e.g., {cite.14.'Martius_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Woollings_et_al_2010}), influence on blocking of slowly varying components of the climate system (sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} ({Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}), {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice}, etc., {cite.14.'Liu_et_al_2012b}), and {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings}.

The most consistent long-term observed trends in blocking for the second half of the 20th century are the reduced winter activity over the North Atlantic (e.g., Croci-Maspoli et al., 2007b), which is consistent with the observed increasing North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) {Glossary.*Trend trend} from the 1960s to the mid-1990s ({Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_8 Section 2.7.8}), as well as an eastward shift of intense winter blocking over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ({cite.14.'Davini_et_al_2012}). The apparent decreasing trend in SH blocking activity (e.g., {cite.14.'Dong_et_al_2008}) seems to be in agreement with the upward trend in the SAM.

The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (Section 8.4.5) reported a tendency for General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}) to underestimate NH blocking frequency and persistence, although most models were able to capture the preferred locations for blocking occurrence and their seasonal distributions. Several intercomparison studies based on a set of CMIP3 models ({cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Vial_and_Osborn_2012}) revealed some progress in the simulation of NH blocking activity, mainly in the North Pacific, but only modest improvements in the North Atlantic. In the SH, blocking frequency and duration was also underestimated, particularly over the Australia–New Zealand sector ({cite.14.'Matsueda_et_al_2010}). CMIP5 models still show a general blocking frequency underestimation over the Euro-Atlantic sector, and some tendency to overestimate North Pacific blocking ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2.9_5_2_2 Section 9.5.2.2}), with considerable inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} ({Box_14_2 Box 14.2}, {'Box_14_2_Figure_1 Figure 1}).

Model biases in the mean flow, rather than in variability, can explain a large part of the blocking underestimation and they are usually evidenced as excessive zonality of the flow or systematic shifts in the latitude of the jet stream ({cite.14.'Matsueda_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2011b}; {cite.14.'Barnes_and_Hartmann_2012}; {cite.14.'Vial_and_Osborn_2012}; {cite.14.'Anstey_et_al_2013}; Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013). Increasing the horizontal {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} in atmospheric {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} with prescribed SSTs has been shown to significantly reduce blocking biases, particularly in the Euro-Atlantic sector and Australasian sectors (e.g., {cite.14.'Matsueda_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Jung_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Dawson_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Berckmans_et_al_2013}), while North Pacific blocking could be more sensitive to systematic errors in tropical SSTs ({cite.14.'Hinton_et_al_2009}). Also blocking biases are smaller in those CMIP5 models with higher horizontal and vertical resolution ({cite.14.'Anstey_et_al_2013}). However, the improvement of blocking simulation with increasing horizontal resolution is less clear in coupled models than in atmospheric GCMs with prescribed SSTs, indicating that both SSTs and the relative coarse resolution in OGCM ({cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2011b}) are important causes of blocking biases.

Most CMIP3 models {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} significant reductions in NH annual blocking frequency ({cite.14.'Barnes_et_al_2012}), particularly during winter, but CMIP5 models seem to indicate weaker decreases in the future (Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013) and a more complex response than that reported for CMIP3 models, including possible regional increases of blocking frequency in summer ({cite.14.'Cattiaux_et_al_2013}; {cite.14.'Masato_et_al_2013}). There is high agreement that winter blocking frequency over the North Atlantic and North Pacific will not increase under enhanced GHG concentrations ({cite.14.'Barnes_et_al_2012}; Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013). Future strengthening of the zonal wind and meridional jet displacements may partially account for some of the projected changes in blocking frequency over the ocean basins of both hemispheres ({cite.14.'Matsueda_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Barnes_and_Hartmann_2012}; Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013). Future trends in blocking intensity and persistence are even more uncertain, with no clear signs of significant changes. How the location and frequency of blocking events will evolve in future are both critically important for understanding {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} change in particular with respect to extreme conditions (e.g., {cite.14.'Sillmann_et_al_2011}; de Vries et al., 2013).

In summary, the increased ability in simulating blocking in some models indicate that there is medium confidence that the frequency of NH and SH blocking will not increase, while trends in blocking intensity and persistence remain uncertain. The implications for blocking related regional changes in North America, Europe and Mediterranean and Central and North Asia are therefore also uncertain [Box 14.2 and 14.8.3, 14.8.6, 14.8.8]
