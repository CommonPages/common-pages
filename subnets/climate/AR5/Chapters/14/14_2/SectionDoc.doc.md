title: 14.2 - Monsoon Systems

Monsoons are a seasonal phenomenon responsible for producing the majority of wet season rainfall within the tropics. The precipitation characteristics over the Asian-Australian, American and African monsoons can be viewed as an integrated global {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} system, associated with a global-scale atmospheric overturning circulation ({cite.14.'Trenberth_et_al_2000}). In {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_1 Section 14.2.1}, changes in precipitation of the global monsoon system are assessed. Changes in regional monsoons are assessed in {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_2 Section 14.2.2} to 14.2.4.
