title: 14.2.3 - American Monsoons

The American monsoons, the North America {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon} System (NAMS) and the South America Monsoon System (SAMS), are associated with large inter-seasonal differences in precipitation, humidity and atmospheric circulation ({cite.14.'Vera_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2010a}). NAMS and SAMS indices are often, though not always, defined in terms of precipitation characteristics ({cite.14.'Wang_and_LinHo_2002}).
