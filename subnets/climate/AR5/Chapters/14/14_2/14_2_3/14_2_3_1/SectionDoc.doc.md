title: 14.2.3.1 - North America Monsoon System

The warm season precipitation in northern Mexico and the southwestern USA is strongly influenced by the NAMS. It has been difficult to simulate many important NAMS-related phenomenon in global {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.14.'Castro_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Lin_et_al_2008b}; Cerezo-Mota et al., 2011), though the models capture gross-scale features associated with the NAMS seasonal cycle ({cite.14.'Liang_et_al_2008b}; Gutzler, 2009). See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.1.8 for a more detailed discussion of NAMS dynamics.

In the NAMS core {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, no distinct precipitation trends have been seen over the last half of the 20th century ({cite.14.'Anderson_et_al_2010}; Arriaga-Ramirez and Cavazos, 2010), due to countervailing trends in increasing intensity and decreasing frequency of events, as well as the decreasing length of the {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} season itself ({cite.14.'Englehart_and_Douglas_2006}). However, monsoonal stream flow in western Mexico has been decreasing, possibly as a result of changing precipitation characteristics or antecedent hydrological conditions rather than overall precipitation amounts ({cite.14.'Gochis_et_al_2007}). There has also been a systematic delay in monsoon onset, peak and termination ({cite.14.'Grantz_et_al_2007}) as well as an increase in extreme precipitation events associated with land-falling hurricanes ({cite.14.'Cavazos_et_al_2008}). Finally, positive trends in NAMS precipitation amounts have been detected in the northern fringes of the core area, that is, Arizona and western New Mexico ({cite.14.'Anderson_et_al_2010}), consistent with northward NAMS expansion during relatively warm periods in the {Glossary.*Holocene Holocene} ({cite.14.'Petersen_1994}; Mock and Brunelle-Daines, 1999; {cite.14.'Harrison_et_al_2003}; {cite.14.'Poore_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Metcalfe_et_al_2010}).

Over the coming century, CMIP5 simulations generally project a precipitation reduction in the core zone of the monsoon (Figures AI.27 and {'Figure_14_6 Figure 14.6}), but this signal is not particularly consistent across models, even under the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario ({cite.14.'Cook_and_Seager_2013}). Thus confidence in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of monsoon precipitation changes is currently low. CMIP5 models have no consensus on future changes of monsoon timing ({'Figure_14_6 Figure 14.6}). Temperature increases are consistently projected in all models (Annex I). This will likely increase the frequency of extreme summer temperatures ({cite.14.'Diffenbaugh_and_Ashfaq_2010}; {cite.14.'Anderson_2011}; {cite.14.'Duffy_and_Tebaldi_2012}), together with projected increase in consecutive dry days ({'Figure_14_6 Figure 14.6}).
