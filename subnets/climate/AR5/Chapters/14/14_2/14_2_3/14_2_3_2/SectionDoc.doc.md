title: 14.2.3.2 - South America Monsoon System

The SAMS mainly influences precipitation in the South American tropics and subtropics ({'Figure_14_1 Figure 14.1}). The main characteristics of SAMS onset are increased humidity flux from the Atlantic Ocean over northern South America, an eastward shift of the subtropical high, strong northwesterly moisture flux east of the tropical Andes, and establishment of the Bolivian High ({cite.14.'Raia_and_Cavalcanti_2008}; {cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2010a}; {cite.14.'Silva_and_Kousky_2012}). Recent SAMS indices have been calculated based on different variables, such as a large scale index ({cite.14.'Silva_and_Carvalho_2007}), moisture flux ({cite.14.'Raia_and_Cavalcanti_2008}), and wind ({cite.14.'Gan_et_al_2006}), in addition to precipitation (Nieto-Ferreira and Rickenbach, 2010; {cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}). As seen below, conclusions regarding SAMS changes can depend on the index chosen.

SAMS duration and amplitude obtained from the observed large-scale index have both increased in the last 32 years ({cite.14.'Jones_and_Carvalho_2013}). Increase of extreme precipitation and consecutive dry days have been observed in the SAMS {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} from 1969 to 2009 ({cite.14.'Skansi_et_al_2013}). The overall annual cycle of precipitation in the SAMS region, including SAMS onset and demise, is generally well represented by models ({cite.14.'Bombardi_and_Carvalho_2009}; {cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}). Extreme precipitation indices in SAMS region are also well simulated by CMIP5 models ({cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}). CMIP5 models subjected to historical {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} show increases in SAMS amplitude, earlier onset and later demise during the 1951–2005 period ({cite.14.'Jones_and_Carvalho_2013}). Using a precipitation based index, precipitation increases in austral summer but decreases in austral spring, indicating delayed SAMS onset in the CMIP3 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2011}). CMIP5 projections based on the global precipitation index ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_1 Section 14.2.1}) consistently show small precipitation increases and little change in onset and retreat ({cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_14_6 Figure 14.6}). On the other hand, when using a different index, earlier onsets and later demises and thus, longer duration of the SAMS by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) has been found ({cite.14.'Jones_and_Carvalho_2013}). Thus there is medium confidence that SAMS overall precipitation will remain unchanged. The different estimates of changes in timing underscores potential {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} related to SAMS timing due to differences in SAMS indices. The models do show significant and robust increases in extreme precipitation indices in the SAMS region, such as seasonal maximum 5-day precipitation total and number of consecutive dry days ({'Figure_14_6 Figure 14.6}), leading to medium confidence in projections of these characteristics.
