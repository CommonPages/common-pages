title: 14.2.2.4 - Australian Monsoon

Some indices of the Australian summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} ({cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Li_et_al_2012a}) show a clear post-1980 reduction, but another index by {cite.14.'Kajikawa_et_al_2010 Kajikawa et al. (2010)} does not fully exhibit this change. Over northwest Australia, summer rainfall has increased by more than 50% ({cite.14.'Rotstayn_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Shi_et_al_2008b}; {cite.14.'Smith_et_al_2008}), whereas over northeast Australia, summer rainfall has decreased markedly since around 1980 ({cite.14.'Li_et_al_2012a}).

Models in general show skill in representing the gross spatial characteristics of Australian monsoon summer precipitation ({cite.14.'Moise_et_al_2005}). Further, atmospheric General Circulation Models ({Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}) forced by {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} anomalies can skilfully reproduce monsoon-related zonal wind variability over recent decades ({cite.14.'Zhou_et_al_2009a}). Recent analysis of the skill of a suite of CMIP3 models showed a good representation in the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean, but a very large range of biases across individual models (more than a factor of 6; {cite.14.'Colman_et_al_2011}). Most CMIP models have biases in monsoon seasonality, but CMIP5 models generally perform better than CMIP3 ({cite.14.'Jourdain_et_al_2013}).

In climate change {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, overall changes in tropical Australian rainfall are small, with substantial {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}; {cite.14.'Moise_et_al_2012}; see also {'Figure_14_27 Figure 14.27}). Using a group of CMIP5 models that exhibit a realistic present-day climatology, most projections using the {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenario produced 5% to 20% more monsoon rainfall by the late 21st century compared to the pre-industrial period ({cite.14.'Jourdain_et_al_2013}). Most CMIP3 model projections suggest delayed monsoon onset and reduced monsoon duration over northern Australia. Weaker model agreement is seen over the interior of the Australian continent, where ensembles show an approximate 7-day delay of both the onset and retreat with little change in duration ({cite.14.'Zhang_et_al_2013a}). CMIP5 model agreement in changes of monsoon precipitation seasonality is low ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}).
