title: 14.2.2.3 - Maritime Continent Monsoon

Interaction between land and water characterizes the Maritime Continent {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} located between the Asian continent and Australia. It provides a land bridge along which maximum {Glossary.*Convection convection} marches from the Asian summer monsoon regime (generally peaking in June, July and August) to the Australian summer monsoon system (generally peaking in December, January and February).

Phenomena such as the {Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO} ({cite.14.'Tangang_et_al_2008}; {Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_2 Section 14.3.2}; {cite.14.'Hidayat_and_Kizu_2010}; {cite.14.'Salahuddin_and_Curtis_2011}), and {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({cite.14.'Aldrian_and_Djamil_2008}; {cite.14.'Moron_et_al_2010}; {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) influence Maritime Continent {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon} variability. Rainfall extremes in the Maritime Continent are strongly influenced by diurnal rainfall variability ({cite.14.'Qian_2008}; {cite.14.'Qian_et_al_2010a}; {cite.14.'Robertson_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Ward_et_al_2011}) as well as the MJO. There have been no obvious trends in extreme rainfall indices in Indonesia, except evidence of a decrease in some areas in annual rainfall and an increase in the ratio of the wet to dry season rainfall ({cite.14.'Aldrian_and_Djamil_2008}).

Modelling the Maritime Continent monsoon is a challenge because of the coarse {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of contemporary large-scale coupled {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} ({cite.14.'Aldrian_and_Djamil_2008}; {cite.14.'Qian_2008}). Most CMIP3 models tend to simulate increasing precipitation in the tropical central Pacific but declining trends over the Maritime Continent for June to August ({cite.14.'Ose_and_Arakawa_2011}), consistent with a decreasing zonal {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradient across the equatorial Pacific and a weakening {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.14.'Collins_et_al_2010}). Projections of CMIP5 models are consistent with those of CMIP3 models, with decreasing precipitation during boreal summer and increasing precipitation during boreal winter, but model agreement is not high (Figures AI.66-67; {'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22}, but see also {'Figure_14_27 Figure 14.27}).
