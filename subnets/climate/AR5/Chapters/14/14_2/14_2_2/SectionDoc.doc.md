title: 14.2.2 - Asian-Australian Monsoon

The seasonal variation in the thermal contrast between the large Eurasian landmass and the Pacific-Indian Oceans drives the powerful Asian-Australian {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} (AAM) system ({'Figure_14_3 Figure 14.3}), which consists of five major subsystems: Indian (also known as South Asian), East Asian, Maritime Continent, Australian, and Western North Pacific monsoons. More than 85% of CMIP5 models show an increase in mean precipitation of the East Asian summer (EAS) monsoon, while more than 95% of models project an increase in heavy precipitation events ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}). All models and all {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} project an increase in both the mean and extreme precipitation in the Indian summer monsoon (referred to as SAS in Figures {'Figure_14_3 14.3} and {'Figure_14_4 14.4}) . In these two regions, the interannual standard deviation of seasonal mean precipitation also increases. Over the Australian-Maritime Continent (AUSMC) monsoon {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, agreement among models is low. {'Figure_14_5 Figure 14.5} shows the time-series of circulation indices representing EAS, Indian (IND), Western North Pacific (WNP) and Australian (AUS) summer monsoon systems. The Indian monsoon circulation index is likely to decrease in the 21st century, while a slight increase in the East Asian monsoon circulation is {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected}. Scatter among models is large for the western North Pacific and Australian monsoon circulation change.

Factors that limit the confidence in quantitative assessment of monsoon changes include sensitivity to model {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ({cite.14.'Cherchi_and_Navarra_2007}; {cite.14.'Klingaman_et_al_2011}), model biases ({cite.14.'Levine_and_Turner_2012}; {cite.14.'Bollasina_and_Ming_2013}), poor skill in simulating the Maddenâ€“Julian Oscillation ({Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO}; {Chapters.9.9_1.9_1_3.9_1_3_3 Section 9.1.3.3}) and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in projected {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} changes ({cite.14.'Collins_et_al_2010}; {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) and in the representation of {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} effects ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_6 Section 9.4.6}).
