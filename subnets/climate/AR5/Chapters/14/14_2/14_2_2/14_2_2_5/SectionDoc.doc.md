title: 14.2.2.5 - Western North Pacific Monsoon

The western North Pacific summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} (WNPSM) occupies a broad oceanic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} of the South China and Philippine Seas, featuring a monsoon trough and a subtropical anticyclonic ridge to the north ({cite.14.'Zhang_and_Wang_2008}).

The western North Pacific monsoon does not show any {Glossary.*Trend trend} during 1950–1999. Since the late 1970s, the correlation has strengthened between interannual variability in the western North Pacific monsoon and {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}), a change mediated by Indian Ocean {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} ({cite.14.'Huang_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Xie_et_al_2010a}). This occurred despite a weakening of the Indian monsoon–ENSO correlation in this period ({cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2008a}).

CMIP5 models project little change in western North Pacific monsoon circulation ({'Figure_14_5 Figure 14.5}) but enhanced precipitation (Figures AI.66-67; {'Figure_12_22 Figure 12.22}; but see also {'Figure_14_24 Figure 14.24}) due to increased moisture convergence ({Chapters.12 Chapter 12}).
