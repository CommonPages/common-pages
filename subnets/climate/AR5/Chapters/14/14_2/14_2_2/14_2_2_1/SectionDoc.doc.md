title: 14.2.2.1 - Indian Monsoon

The Indian summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} is known to have undergone abrupt shifts in the past millennium, giving rise to prolonged and intense droughts ({cite.14.'Meehl_and_Hu_2006}; {cite.14.'Sinha_et_al_2011}; see also {Chapters.2 Chapter 2}). The observed recent weakening tendency in seasonal rainfall and the regional re-distribution has been partially {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to factors such as changes in {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon} and/or sulphate aerosols ({cite.14.'Chung_and_Ramanathan_2006}; {cite.14.'Lau_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Bollasina_et_al_2011}), land use ({cite.14.'Niyogi_et_al_2010}; see also {Chapters.10 Chapter 10}) and SSTs ({cite.14.'Annamalai_et_al_2013}). An increase in extreme rainfall events occurred at the expense of weaker rainfall events ({cite.14.'Goswami_et_al_2006}) over the central Indian {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}, and in many other areas ({cite.14.'Krishnamurthy_et_al_2009}). With a declining number of monsoon depressions ({cite.14.'Krishnamurthy_and_Ajayamohan_2010}), the upward {Glossary.*Trend trend} in extreme rainfall events may be due to enhanced moisture content ({cite.14.'Goswami_et_al_2006}) or warmer SSTs in the tropical Indian Ocean ({cite.14.'Rajeevan_et_al_2008}).

CMIP3 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} show suppressed rainfall over the equatorial Indian Ocean (Cai et al., 2011e; {cite.14.'Turner_and_Annamalai_2012}), and an increase in seasonal mean rainfall over India ({cite.14.'Ueda_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Annamalai_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Turner_et_al_2007a}; {cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2011b}; {cite.14.'Sabade_et_al_2011}). These results are generally confirmed by CMIP5 projections ({cite.14.'Chaturvedi_et_al_2012}). The projected changes in Indian monsoon rainfall increase with the {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} among {Glossary.*Representative_Concentration_Pathways RCPs} ({cite.14.'May_2011}; see {'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}; SAS).

In a suite of models that realistically simulate {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}–monsoon relationships, normal monsoon years are likely to become less frequent in the future, but there is no clear consensus about the occurrence of extreme monsoon years ({cite.14.'Turner_and_Annamalai_2012}). CMIP3 models indicate ENSO–monsoon relationships to persist in the future ({cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2011b}), but there is low confidence in the {Glossary.*Projection projection} of ENSO variability ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}). Sub-seasonal scale monsoon variability is linked to the {Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO} but again the confidence in the future projection of MJO remains low ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_2 Section 14.3.2}).

CMIP5 models project an increase in mean precipitation as well as its interannual variability and extremes ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}; SAS). All models project an increase in heavy precipitation events but disagree on CDD changes. Regarding seasonality, model agreement is high on an earlier onset and later retreat, and hence longer duration. The monsoon circulation weakens in the future ({'Figure_14_5 Figure 14.5}; IND) but the precipitation increases. Like the global monsoon ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_1 Section 14.2.1}), the precipitation increase is largely due to the increased moisture flux from ocean to land.
