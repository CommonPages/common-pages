title: 14.2.2.2 - East Asian Monsoon

The East Asian {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} is characterized by a wet season and southerly flow in summer and by dry cold northerly flow in winter. The East Asian summer (EAS) monsoon circulation has experienced an inter-decadal weakening from the 1960s to the 1980s ({cite.14.'Hori_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Li_et_al_2010a}), associated with deficient rainfall in North China and excessive rainfall in central East China along 30Â°N ({cite.14.'Hu_1997}; {cite.14.'Wang_2001}; {cite.14.'Gong_and_Ho_2002}; {cite.14.'Yu_et_al_2004}). The summer monsoon circulation has begun to recover in recent decades ({cite.14.'Liu_et_al_2012a}; {cite.14.'Zhu_et_al_2012}). The summer rainfall amount over East Asia shows no clear {Glossary.*Trend trend} during the 20th century ({cite.14.'Zhang_and_Zhou_2011}), although significant trends may be found in local station records ({cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2006}). The winter monsoon circulation weakened significantly after the 1980s ({cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2009a}; {cite.14.'Wang_and_Chen_2010}). See Supplementary Material Sections 14.SM.1.3 to 14.SM.1.7 for additional discussions of natural variability.

CMIP3 models show reasonable skill in simulating large-scale circulation of the EAS monsoon ({cite.14.'Boo_et_al_2011}), but their performance is poor in reproducing the monsoon rainband ({cite.14.'Lin_et_al_2008a}; {cite.14.'Li_and_Zhou_2011}). Only a few CMIP3 models reproduce the Baiu rainband ({cite.14.'Ninomiya_2012}) and high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} models ({cite.14.'Kitoh_and_Kusunoki_2008}) show better performance than low resolution CMIP3 type models in simulating the monsoon rainband ({cite.14.'Kitoh_and_Kusunoki_2008}). CMIP3 models show large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of monsoon precipitation and circulation ({cite.14.'Ding_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Kripalani_et_al_2007a}) but the simulation of interannual variability of the EAS monsoon circulation has improved from CMIP3 to CMIP5 ({cite.14.'Sperber_et_al_2012}). Climate change may bring a change in the position of the monsoon rain band ({cite.14.'Li_et_al_2010a}).

CMIP5 projections indicate a likely increase in both the circulation ({'Figure_14_5 Figure 14.5}) and rainfall of the EAS monsoon ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}) throughout the 21st century. This is different from other Asian-Australian monsoon subsystems, where the increase in precipitation ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}) is generally associated with weakening monsoon circulation ({'Figure_14_5 Figure 14.5}). Interannual variability of seasonal mean rainfall is very likely to increase except for {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}). Heavy precipitation events (SDII and R5d) are also very likely to increase. CMIP5 models project an earlier monsoon onset and longer duration but the spread among models is large ({'Figure_14_4 Figure 14.4}).
