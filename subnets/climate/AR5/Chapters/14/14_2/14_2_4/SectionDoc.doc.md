title: 14.2.4 - African Monsoon

In Africa, {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} circulation affects precipitation in West Africa where notable upper air flow reversals are observed. East and south African precipitation is generally described by variations in the tropical convergence zone rather than as a monsoon feature. This section covers the West African monsoon, and {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_7 Section 14.8.7} also covers the latter two regions.

The West African monsoon develops during northern spring and summer, with a rapid northward jump of the rainfall belt from along the Gulf of Guinea at 5°N in May to June to the Sahel at 10°N in July to August. Factors influencing the West African monsoon include interannual to decadal variations, land processes and the direct response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing}. Cross-equatorial tropical Atlantic {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} patterns influence the monsoon flow and moistening of the boundary layer, so that a colder northern tropical Atlantic induces negative rainfall anomalies ({cite.14.'Biasutti_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Giannini_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Xue_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Rowell_2011}).

In CMIP3 simulations, rainfall is projected to decrease in the early part but increase towards the end of the rainy season, implying a small delay in the monsoon season and an intensification of late-season rains ({cite.14.'Biasutti_and_Sobel_2009}; {cite.14.'Biasutti_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}). CMIP5 models, on the other hand, simulate the variability of tropical Atlantic SST patterns with little credibility ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_5.9_4_2_5_2 Section 9.4.2.5.2}) and model {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} is known to limit the ability to capture the mesoscale ‘squall line’ systems that form a central element in the maintenance of the rainy season (Ruti and Dell’Aquila, 2010; see also {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_7 Section 14.8.7}). Therefore, {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of the West African monsoon rainfall appear to be uncertain, reflected by considerable model deficiencies and spread in the projections ({'Figure_14_7 Figure 14.7}). Note that this figure is based on a somewhat eastward extended area for the West African monsoon (NAF in {'Figure_14_3 Figure 14.3}), seen as a component of the global monsoon system ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_1 Section 14.2.1}). The limitations of model simulations in the {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} arising from the lack of convective organization ({cite.14.'Kohler_et_al_2010}) leading to the underestimation of interannual variability ({cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2009}) imply that confidence in projections of the African monsoon is low.

The limited information that could be deduced from CMIP3 has not improved much in CMIP5. {'Figure_14_7 Figure 14.7} largely confirms the findings based on CMIP3. The CMIP5 model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} projects a modest change in the onset date (depending on the scenario) and a small delay in the retreat date, leading to a small increase in the duration of the rainy season. The delay in the monsoon retreat is larger in the high-end {Topics.*Emissions emission} {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}. The interannual variance and the 5-day rain intensity show a robust increase, while a small increase in dry day periods is less significant.
