title: 14.2.1 - Global Overview

The global land {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} precipitation displays a decreasing {Glossary.*Trend trend} over the last half-century, with primary contributions from the weakened summer monsoon systems in the NH ({cite.14.'Wang_and_Ding_2006}). The combined global ocean–land monsoon precipitation has intensified during 1979–2008, mainly due to an upward trend in the NH summer oceanic monsoon precipitation ({cite.14.'Zhou_et_al_2008b}; {cite.14.'Hsu_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2012b}). Because the fractional increase in monsoon area is greater than that in total precipitation, the ratio of the latter to the former (a measure of the global monsoon intensity) exhibits a decreasing trend ({cite.14.'Hsu_et_al_2011}). CMIP5 models generally reproduce the observed global monsoon domain, but the disparity between the best and poorest models is large ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2.9_5_2_4 Section 9.5.2.4}).

In the CMIP5 models the global monsoon area (GMA), the global monsoon total precipitation (GMP) and the global monsoon precipitation intensity (GMI) are projected to increase by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100, {cite.14.'Hsu_et_al_2013}; {cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_14_1 Figure 14.1}). See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.1.2 for the definitions of GMA, GMP and GMI. The CMIP5 model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} show an expansion of GMA mainly over the central to eastern tropical Pacific, the southern Indian Ocean and eastern Asia. In all RCP {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, GMA is very likely to increase, and GMI is likely to increase, resulting in a very likely increase in GMP, by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100). The 100-year median changes in GMP are +5%, +8%, +10%, and +16% in {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6}, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} scenarios, respectively. Indices of precipitation extremes such as simple daily precipitation intensity index (SDII), defined as the total precipitation divided by the number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 1 mm, annual maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5d) and consecutive dry days (CDD) all indicate that intense precipitation will increase at larger rates than those of mean precipitation ({'Figure_14_1 Figure 14.1}). The standard deviation of interannual variability in seasonal average precipitation (Psd) is projected to increase by many models but some models show a decrease in Psd. This is related to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in projections of future changes in tropical sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} ({Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST}). Regarding seasonality, CMIP5 models project that monsoon onset dates will come earlier or not change much while monsoon retreat dates will delay, resulting in a lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions.

CMIP5 models show a decreasing trend of lower-{Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} wind convergence (dynamical factor) throughout the 20th and 21st centuries ({'Figure_14_2 Figure 14.2}d). With increased moisture (see also {Chapters.12.12_4 Section 12.4}), the moisture flux convergence shows an increasing trend from 1980 through the 21st century ({'Figure_14_2 Figure 14.2}c). Surface evaporation shows a similar trend ({'Figure_14_2 Figure 14.2}b) associated with warmer SSTs. Therefore, the global monsoon precipitation increases ({'Figure_14_2 Figure 14.2}a) due to increases in moisture flux convergence and surface evaporation despite a weakened monsoon circulation. Besides greenhouse gases ({Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}), monsoons are affected by changes in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} loadings ({cite.14.'Ramanathan_et_al_2005}). The aerosol direct {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} may heat the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} but cools the surface, altering atmospheric stability and inducing horizontal pressure gradients that modulate the large-scale circulation and hence monsoon rainfall ({cite.14.'Lau_et_al_2008}). However, the representation of aerosol forcing differs among models, and remains an important {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty ({Chapters.7 Chapter 7} and {Chapters.12.12_2.12_2_2 Section 12.2.2}), particularly in some regional monsoon systems.
