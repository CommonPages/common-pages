title: 14.4.2 - El Niño Changes over Recent Decades and in the Future

The amplitude modulation of {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} at longer time scales has been observed in reconstructed instrumental records ({cite.14.'Gu_and_Philander_1995}; {cite.14.'Wang_1995}; {cite.14.'Mitchell_and_Wallace_1996}; {cite.14.'Wang_and_Wang_1996}; {cite.14.'Power_et_al_1999}; {cite.14.'An_and_Wang_2000}; {cite.14.'Yeh_and_Kirtman_2005}; {cite.14.'Power_and_Smith_2007}; {Chapters.5.5_4.5_4_1 Section 5.4.1}), in {Glossary.*Proxy proxy} records ({cite.14.'Cobb_et_al_2003}; {cite.14.'Braganza_et_al_2009}; Li et al., 2011c; {cite.14.'Yan_et_al_2011}), and is also simulated by coupled {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} ({cite.14.'Lau_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Wittenberg_2009}). Some studies have suggested that the modulation was due to changes in mean climate conditions in the tropical Pacific ({cite.14.'An_and_Wang_2000}; {cite.14.'Fedorov_and_Philander_2000}; {cite.14.'Wang_and_An_2001}, 2002; Li et al., 2011c), as observed since the 1980s ({cite.14.'An_and_Jin_2000}; {cite.14.'An_and_Wang_2000}; {cite.14.'Fedorov_and_Philander_2000}; {cite.14.'Kim_and_An_2011}). With three events during 2000-2010, which meets intensity in Nino4 being larger than in Nino3, two events during 1990-2000 and only two events are found for 1950-1990 the maximum {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} warming during El Niño now appears to occur more often in the central Pacific ({'Figure_14_13 Figure 14.13}; {cite.14.'Ashok_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Kao_and_Yu_2009}; {cite.14.'Kug_et_al_2009}; {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_4.9_5_3_4_1 Section 9.5.3.4.1} and Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.2; {cite.14.'Yeh_et_al_2009}), with global impacts that are distinct from ‘standard’ El Niño events where the maximum warming is over the eastern Pacific ({cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2006a}; {cite.14.'Ashok_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Kao_and_Yu_2009}; {cite.14.'Hu_et_al_2012b}). During the past century, an increasing {Glossary.*Trend trend} in ENSO amplitude was also observed (Li et al., 2011c; {cite.14.'Vance_et_al_2012}), possibly caused by a warming climate ({cite.14.'Zhang_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Kim_and_An_2011}) although other reconstructions in this data-sparse {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} dispute this trend ({cite.14.'Giese_and_Ray_2011}).

Long coupled GCM simulations show that decadal-to-centennial modulations of ENSO can be generated without any change in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} ({cite.14.'Wittenberg_2009}; {cite.14.'Yeh_et_al_2011}), with multi-decadal epochs of anomalous ENSO behaviour. The modulations result from nonlinear processes in the tropical climate system ({cite.14.'Timmermann_et_al_2003}), the interaction with the mean climate state ({cite.14.'Ye_and_Hsieh_2008}; {cite.14.'Choi_et_al_2009}, 2011, 2012), or from random changes in ENSO activity triggered by {Glossary.*Chaotic chaotic} atmospheric variability ({cite.14.'Power_and_Colman_2006}; {cite.14.'Power_et_al_2006}). There is little consensus as to whether the decadal modulations of ENSO properties (amplitude and spatial pattern) during recent decades are due to {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} effects or natural variability. Instrumental SST records are available back to the 1850s, but good observations of the coupled air–sea feedbacks that control ENSO behaviour— including subsurface temperature and current fluctuations, and air–sea exchanges of heat, momentum and water—are available only after the late 1970s, making observed historical variations in ENSO feedbacks highly uncertain ({cite.14.'Chen_2003}; {cite.14.'Wittenberg_2004}).

CMIP5 models show some improvement compared to CMIP3, especially in ENSO amplitude ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_4.9_5_3_4_1 Section 9.5.3.4.1}). Selected CMIP5 models that simulate well strong El Niño events show a gradual increase of El Niño intensity, especially over the central Pacific ({cite.14.'Kim_and_Yu_2012}). CMIP3 models suggested a westward shift of SST variability in future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({cite.14.'Boer_2009}; {cite.14.'Yeh_et_al_2009}). Generally, however, future changes in El Niño intensity in CMIP5 models are model dependent ({cite.14.'Guilyardi_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Kim_and_Yu_2012}; {cite.14.'Stevenson_et_al_2012}), and not significantly distinguished from natural modulations ({cite.14.'Stevenson_2012}; {'Figure_14_14 Figure 14.14}). Because the change in tropical mean conditions (especially the zonal gradient) in a warming climate is model dependent ({Chapters.14.14_4.14_4_1 Section 14.4.1}), changes in ENSO intensity for the 21st century ({cite.14.'Solomon_and_Newman_2011}; {cite.14.'Hu_et_al_2012a}) are uncertain ({'Figure_14_14 Figure 14.14}). Future changes in ENSO depend on competing changes in coupled ocean–atmospheric {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} (Philip and Van Oldenborgh, 2006; {cite.14.'Collins_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Vecchi_and_Wittenberg_2010}), and on the dynamical regime a given model is in. There is high confidence, however, that ENSO will remain the dominant mode of natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} in the 21st century ({cite.14.'Collins_et_al_2010}; Guilyardi et al. 2012; Kim and Yu 2012; Stevenson 2012).
