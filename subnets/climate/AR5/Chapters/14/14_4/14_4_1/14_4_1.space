title: 14.4.1 - Tropical Pacific Mean State
section 14_4_1

  |{Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} in the western tropical Pacific has increased by up to 1.5°C per century, and the warm pool has expanded. Studies disagree on how the east– west SST gradient along the equator has changed. Most CMIP3 and CMIP5 models also disagree on the response of zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific.
