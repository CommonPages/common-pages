title: 14.4.4 - Assessment Summary

{Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} shows considerable inter-decadal modulations in amplitude and spatial pattern within the instrumental record. Models without changes in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcing} display similar modulations, and there is little consensus on whether the observed changes in ENSO are due to {Glossary.*External_forcing external forcing} or natural variability (see also {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3 Section 10.3.3} for an {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} discussion).

There is high confidence that ENSO will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability with global influences in the 21st century, and due to changes in moisture availability ENSO-induced rainfall variability on regional scales will intensify. There is medium confidence that ENSO-induced {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} patterns will shift eastward over the North Pacific and North America. There is low confidence in changes in the intensity and spatial pattern of El NinÌƒo in a warmer climate.
