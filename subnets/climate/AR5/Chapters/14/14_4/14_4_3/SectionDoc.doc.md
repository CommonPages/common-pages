There is little improvement in the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} relative to CMIP3 in the amplitude and spatial correlation metrics of precipitation teleconnections in response to {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, in particular within regions of strong observed precipitation teleconnections (equatorial South America, the western equatorial Pacific and a southern section of North America; {cite.14.'Langenbrunner_and_Neelin_2013}). Scenario {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} in CMIP3 and CMIP5 showed a systematic eastward shift in both El Niñoand {Glossary.*La_Nin_a La Niña}-induced {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} patterns over the extratropical NH ({cite.14.'Meehl_and_Teng_2007}; {cite.14.'Stevenson_et_al_2012}; {'Figure_14_15 Figure 14.15}), which might be due to the eastward migration of tropical {Glossary.*Convection convection} centres associated with the expansion of the warm pool in a warm climate ({cite.14.'Muller_and_Roeckner_2006}; Müller and Roeckner, 2008; {cite.14.'Cravatte_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Kug_et_al_2010}), or changes in the mid-latitude mean circulation ({cite.14.'Meehl_and_Teng_2007}). Some models produced an intensified ENSO {Glossary.*Teleconnection_pattern teleconnection pattern} over the North Atlantic {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} in a warmer climate (Müller and Roeckner, 2008; {cite.14.'Bulic_et_al_2012}) and a weakened teleconnection pattern over the North Pacific ({cite.14.'Stevenson_2012}). It is unclear whether the eastward shift of tropical convection is related to longitudinal shifts in El Niño maximum {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} anomalies (see Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.2) or to changes in the mean state in the tropical Pacific. Some coupled {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs}, which do not show an increase in the central Pacific warming during El Nino in response to a warming climate, do not produce a substantial change in the longitudinal location of tropical convection (Müller and Roeckner, 2008; {cite.14.'Yeh_et_al_2009}).

In a warmer climate, the increase in atmospheric moisture intensifies temporal variability of precipitation even if atmospheric circulation variability remains the same (Trenberth 2011; {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5 Section 12.4.5}). This applies to ENSO-induced precipitation variability but the possibility of changes in ENSO teleconnections complicates this general conclusion, making it somewhat regional-dependent (Seager et al. 2012)
