title: 14.1.4 - Summary of Climate Phenomena and their Impact on Regional Climate

{Box_14_1 Box 14.1}, {'Box_14_1_Figure_1 Figure 1} illustrates the large-scale climate phenomena assessed in this chapter. Many of the climate phenomena are evident in the map of annual mean rainfall (central panel). The most abundant annual rainfall occurs in the tropical convergence zones: Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}) over the Pacific, Atlantic and African equatorial belt (see {Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_1 Section 14.3.1.1}), South Pacific Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*South_Pacific_Convergence_Zone SPCZ}) over central South Pacific (see {Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_2 Section 14.3.1.2}) and South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) over Southern South America and Southern Atlantic (see {Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_3 Section 14.3.1.3}). In the global {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} domain (white contours on the map), large amounts of precipitation occur but only in certain seasons (see {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_1 Section 14.2.1}). Local maxima in precipitation are also apparent over the major storm track regions in mid-latitudes (see {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_2 Section 14.7.2}). {Box_14_1 Box 14.1} Figure 1 also illustrates surface air temperature (left panels) and precipitation (right panels) {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} patterns for {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} (in December to February and June to August; see {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}), {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} (in December to February; see {Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_1 Section 14.5.1}) and {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} (in September to November; see {Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}). The teleconnection patterns were obtained by taking the correlation between monthly gridded temperature and precipitation anomalies and indices for the modes (see {Box_14_1 Box 14.1} definitions). It can be seen that all three modes have far-reaching effects on temperature and precipitation in many parts of the world. {Box_14_1 Box 14.1}, {'Box_14_1_Table_1 Table 1} briefly summarizes the main regional impacts of different well-known modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}.
