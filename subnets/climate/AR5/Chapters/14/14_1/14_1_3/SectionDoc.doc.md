title: 14.1.3 - Tropical and Extratropical Cyclones

Tropical and extratropical cyclones (TCs and ETCs) are important weather phenomena intimately linked to {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} phenomena and modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. Both types of cyclone can produce extreme wind speeds and precipitation (see {Chapters.3.3_4 Section 3.4}, IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX; {cite.14.'IPCC_2012})). Sections {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 14.6.1} and {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 14.6.2} assess the recent progress in scientific understanding of how these important weather systems are likely to change in the future.
