title: 14.1.2 - Modes of Climate Variability

{Topics.*Regional_Climate Regional climates} are strongly influenced by modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} (see {Box_14_1 Box 14.1} for definitions of mode, regime and {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection}). This chapter assesses major modes such as El Niño-{Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation} ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}, {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}), the North Atlantic Oscillation/Northern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}/{Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM}) and Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}) in the extratropics ({Chapters.14.14_5 Section 14.5}) and various other well-known modes such as the Pacific North American ({Glossary.*Pacific_North_American_pattern PNA}) pattern, Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation ({Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO}), etc. ({Chapters.14.14_7 Section 14.7}). Many of these modes are described in previous IPCC reports (e.g., Section 3.6 of {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} WG1). {Chapters.2 Chapter 2} gives operational definitions of mode indices ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}, {'Box_2_5_Table_1 Table 1}) and an assessment of observed historical behaviour ({Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_8 Section 2.7.8}). {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} are generally able to simulate the gross features of many of the modes of variability ({Chapters.9.9_5 Section 9.5}), and so provide useful tools for understanding how modes might change in the future (Müller and Roeckner, 2008; {cite.14.'Handorf_and_Dethloff_2009}).

Modes and regimes provide a simplified description of variations in the climate system. In the simplest paradigm, variations in climate variables are described by linear {Glossary.*Projection projection} onto a set of mode indices ({cite.14.'Baldwin_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Baldwin_and_Thompson_2009}; {cite.14.'Hurrell_and_Deser_2009}). For example, a large fraction of interannual variance in Northern Hemisphere (NH) {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure is accounted for by linear combinations of the NAM and the PNA modes ({cite.14.'Quadrelli_and_Wallace_2004}). Alternatively, the nonlinear regime paradigm considers the probability distribution of local climate variables to be a multi-modal mixture of distributions related to a discrete set of regimes/types ({cite.14.'Palmer_1999}; {cite.14.'Cassou_and_Terray_2001}; {cite.14.'Monahan_et_al_2001}).

There is ongoing debate on the relevance of the different paradigms ({cite.14.'Stephenson_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Christiansen_2005}; {cite.14.'Ambaum_2008}; {cite.14.'Fereday_et_al_2008}), and care is required when interpreting these constructs ({cite.14.'Monahan_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Takahashi_et_al_2011}).

Modes of climate variability may respond to climate change in one or more of the following ways:

- No change—the modes will continue to behave as they have done in the recent past.
- Index changes—the probability distributions of the mode indices may change (e.g., shifts in the mean and/or variance, or more complex changes in shape such as changes in local probability density, e.g., frequency of regimes).
- Spatial changes—the climate patterns associated with the modes may change spatially (e.g., new flavours of ENSO; see {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4} and Supplementary Material) or the local amplitudes of the climate patterns may change (e.g., enhanced precipitation for a given change in index ({cite.14.'Bulic_and_Kucharski_2012})).
- Structural changes—the types and number of modes and their mutual dependencies may change; completely new modes could in principle emerge.

An assessment of changes in modes of variability can be problematic for several reasons. First, interpretation depends on how one separates modes of variability from forced changes in the time mean or variations in the annual cycle ({cite.14.'Pezzulli_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Compo_and_Sardeshmukh_2010}). Modes of variability are generally defined using indices based on either detrended anomalies ({cite.14.'Deser_et_al_2010b}) or anomalies obtained by removing the time mean over a historical reference period (see {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}). The mode index in the latter approach will include changes in the mean, whereas by definition there is no {Glossary.*Trend trend} in a mode index when it is based on detrended anomalies. Second, it can be difficult to separate natural variations from forced responses, for example, warming trends in the N. Atlantic during the 20th century that may be due to trends in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} and other {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} rather than natural internal variability (see Sections {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 14.6.2} and {Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_1 14.7.1}). Finally, modes of climate variability are nonlinearly related to one another ({cite.14.'Hsieh_et_al_2006}) and this relationship can change in time (e.g., trends in correlation between ENSO and NAO indices).

Even when the change in a mode of variability index does not contribute greatly to mean regional climate change, a climate mode may still play an important role in regional climate variability and extremes. Natural variations, such as those due to modes of variability, are a major {Glossary.*Source source} of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of mean regional climate ({cite.14.'Deser_et_al_2012}). Furthermore, changes in the extremes of regional climate are likely to be sensitive to small changes in variance or shape of the distribution of the mode indices or the mode spatial patterns ({cite.14.'Coppola_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2008}).
