section 14_1_2

  |{Topics.*Regional_Climate Regional climates} are strongly influenced by modes of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. Modes and regimes provide a simplified description of variations in the climate system. An assessment of changes in modes of variability can be problematic for several reasons. First, interpretation depends on how one separates modes of variability from forced changes in the time mean or variations in the annual cycle. Second, it can be difficult to separate natural variations from forced responses. Finally, modes of climate variability are nonlinearly related to one another and this relationship can change in time.
