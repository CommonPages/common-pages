title: 14.1.1 - Monsoons and Tropical Convergence Zones

The major {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} systems are associated with the seasonal movement of convergence zones over land, leading to profound seasonal changes in local hydrological cycles. {Chapters.14.14_2 Section 14.2} assesses current understanding of monsoonal behaviour in the present and future climate, how monsoon characteristics are influenced by the large-scale tropical {Topics.*Climate_Variability modes of variability} and their potential changes and how the monsoons in turn affect regional extremes. Convergence zones over the tropical oceans not only play a fundamental role in determining {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climates} but also influence the global atmospheric circulation. {Chapters.14.14_3 Section 14.3} presents an assessment of these and other important tropical phenomena.
