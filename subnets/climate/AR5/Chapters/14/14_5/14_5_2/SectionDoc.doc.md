title: 14.5.2 - Southern Annular Mode

The Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}, also known as Antarctic Oscillation, AAO), is the leading mode of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} in the SH extratropics, describing fluctuations in the latitudinal position and strength of the mid-latitude eddy-driven westerly jet (see {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}; {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_2 Section 9.5.3.2}). SAM variability has a major influence on the climate of Antarctica, Australasia, southern South America and South Africa ({cite.14.'Watterson_2009}; {cite.14.'Thompson_et_al_2011} and references therein).

The physical mechanisms of the SAM are well understood, and the SAM is well represented in {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, although the detailed spatial and temporal characteristics vary between models ({cite.14.'Raphael_and_Holland_2006}). In the past few decades the SAM index has exhibited a positive {Glossary.*Trend trend} in austral summer and autumn ({'Figure_14_16 Figure 14.16}, {cite.14.'Marshall_2007}; {cite.14.'Jones_et_al_2009b}), a change {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the effects of {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} depletion and, to a lesser extent, the increase in {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} ({cite.14.'Thompson_et_al_2011}, see also {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3.10_3_3_3 Section 10.3.3.3}). It is likely that these two factors will continue to be the principal drivers into the future, but as the {Glossary.*Ozone_hole ozone hole} recovers they will be competing to push the SAM in opposite directions ({cite.14.'Arblaster_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Thompson_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2013}), at least during late austral spring and summer, when ozone depletion has had its greatest impact on the SAM. The SAM is also influenced by teleconnections to the tropics, primarily associated with {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({cite.14.'Carvalho_et_al_2005}; L’Heureux and Thompson, 2006). Changes to the tropical circulation, and to such teleconnections, as the climate warms could further affect SAM variability ({cite.14.'Karpechko_et_al_2010}). See Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.3.1 for further details on the observed variability of SAM.

The CMIP3 models projected a continuing positive trend in the SAM in both summer and winter ({cite.14.'Miller_et_al_2006}). However, those models generally had poor simulations of stratospheric ozone, and tended to underestimate natural variability and to misrepresent observed trends in the SAM, indicating that care should be taken in interpretation of their future SAM {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({cite.14.'Fogt_et_al_2009}). {cite.14.'Arblaster_et_al_2011 Arblaster et al. (2011)} showed that there can be large differences in the sensitivity of these models to {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} increases, which affects their projected trends in the SAM.

Since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} a number of chemistry–climate models (CCMs) have been run that have fully interactive stratospheric chemistry, although unlike coupled {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} ocean models they are usually not coupled to the oceans (see also Sections {Chapters.9.9_1.9_1_3.9_1_3_2.9_1_3_2_8 9.1.3.2.8} and {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_6.9_4_6_2 9.4.6.2}). The majority of CCMs and coupled models, which generally compare well to reanalyses ({cite.14.'Gerber_et_al_2010}) although many exhibit biases in their placement of the SH eddy-driven jet ({cite.14.'Wilcox_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2013}), indicate that through to at least the mid-21st century the current observed SAM changes are neutralized or reversed during austral summer ({cite.14.'Perlwitz_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Son_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Polvani_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2013}). {'Figure_14_16 Figure 14.16} shows the projected {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble}-mean future SAM index evolution during DJF from a suite of CMIP5 models, suggesting that the recent positive trend will weaken considerably as stratospheric ozone concentrations recover over southern high latitudes.

Projected 21st century changes in the SAM, and the closely associated SH eddy-driven jet position, vary by season ({cite.14.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013}), and are sensitive to the rate of ozone recovery ({cite.14.'Son_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Eyring_et_al_2013}) and to GHG {Topics.*Scenarios emissions scenario} ({cite.14.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}; {cite.14.'Eyring_et_al_2013}). In the {Glossary.*RCP2_6 RCP2.6} scenario, with small increases in GHGs, ozone recovery may dominate in austral summer giving a small projected equatorward jet shift ({cite.14.'Eyring_et_al_2013}) with little change in the annual mean jet position ({cite.14.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}). In {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} large GHG increases are expected to dominate, giving an ongoing poleward shift of the SH jet in all seasons ({cite.14.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}; {cite.14.'Eyring_et_al_2013}). In RCP4.5 the influences of ozone recovery and GHG increases are expected to approximately balance in austral summer, with an ongoing poleward jet shift projected in the other seasons ({cite.14.'Swart_and_Fyfe_2012}; {cite.14.'Eyring_et_al_2013}; {cite.14.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013}).
