title: 14.5.1 - Northern Modes

The {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} is a well-established dipolar mode of {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} having opposite variations in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level} pressure between the Atlantic subtropical high and the Iceland/Arctic low ({cite.14.'Wanner_et_al_2001}; {cite.14.'Hurrell_et_al_2003}; {cite.14.'Budikova_2009}). It is strongly associated with the tropospheric jet, storms (see {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}), and {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} that determine the weather and climate over the North Atlantic and surrounding continents ({cite.14.'Hurrell_and_Deser_2009}; {Box_14_2 Box 14.2}). The NAO exists in boreal summer as well as in boreal winter, albeit with different physical characteristics ({cite.14.'Sun_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Folland_et_al_2009}).

Over the North Pacific, there is a similar wintertime dipolar mode known as the NPO associated with north–south displacements of the Asian-Pacific jet stream and the Pacific storm track. The NPO influences winter air temperature and precipitation over much of western North America as well as {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} over the Pacific sector of the Arctic, more so than either {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) or the {Glossary.*Pacific_North_American_pattern PNA} ({cite.14.'Linkin_and_Nigam_2008}).

These dipolar modes have been interpreted as the regional manifestation of an annular mode in sea level pressure known as the Arctic Oscillation (AO; {cite.14.'Thompson_and_Wallace_1998}) or the Northern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM}; {cite.14.'Thompson_and_Wallace_2000}). The AO (NAM at 1000 hPa) index and the NAO index (see {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}, {'Box_2_5_Table_1 Table 1}) are strongly correlated but the AO spatial pattern is more zonally symmetric and so differs from the NAO over the N. Pacific ({cite.14.'Ambaum_et_al_2001}; {cite.14.'Feldstein_and_Franzke_2006}). Hereafter, the term NAO is used to denote NAO, AO and NAM in boreal winter unless further distinction is required.

{Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} are generally able to simulate the gross features of NAO and NPO (see {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_2 Section 9.5.3.2}). It has been argued that these modes may be a preferred pattern of response to climate change ({cite.14.'Gerber_et_al_2008}). However, this is not supported by a detailed examination of the vertical structure of the simulated global warming response ({cite.14.'Woollings_2008}). {cite.14.'Hori_et_al_2007 Hori et al. (2007)} noted that NAO variability did not change substantially in the Special Report on {Topics.*Emissions Emission} {Topics.*Scenarios Scenarios} (SRES)-A1B and 20th century scenarios and so concluded that the {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the NAO index (defined relative to a historical mean state) is a result of an {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} trend in the basic mean state rather than due to changes in NAO variability. However, other research indicates that there is a coherent two-way interaction between the trend in the mean state and the NAO-like modes of variability—the mode and/or regime structure change due to changes in the mean state ({cite.14.'Branstator_and_Selten_2009} ; {cite.14.'Barnes_and_Polvani_2013}). {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2} assesses the jet and storm track changes associated with the projected responses.

Model simulations have underestimated the magnitude of the large positive trend from 1960-2000 in winter NAO observations, which now appears to be more likely due to natural variability rather than anthropogenic influences (see {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3.10_3_3_2 Section 10.3.3.2}). Some studies have even considered NAO to be a {Glossary.*Source source} of natural variability that needs to be removed before detection and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of anthropogenic changes ({cite.14.'Zhang_et_al_2006}). {Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} of regional surface air temperature response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} has been found to be robust to the exclusion of model-simulated AO and PNA changes ({cite.14.'Wu_and_Karoly_2007}). Model projections of wintertime European precipitation have been shown to become more consistent with observed trends after removal of trends due to NAO (Bhend and von Storch, 2008). Underestimation of trends in NAO can lead to biases in projections of {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate}, for example, Arctic sea ice ({cite.14.'Koldunov_et_al_2010}).

Underestimation of NAO long-term variability may be due to missing or poorly represented processes in climate models. Recent observational and modelling studies have helped to confirm that the lower {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} plays an important role in explaining recent more negative NAO winters and long-term trends in NAO ({cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Dong_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Ouzeau_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Schimanke_et_al_2011}). This is supported by evidence that seasonal forecasts of NAO can be improved by inclusion of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ({Glossary.*Quasi_Biennal_Oscillation QBO}; {cite.14.'Boer_and_Hamilton_2008}; {cite.14.'Marshall_and_Scaife_2010}). Other studies have found that observed changes in stratospheric water vapour changes from 1965–1995 led to an impact on NAO simulated by a model, and have suggested that changes in stratospheric water vapour may be another possible pathway for communicating tropical forcing to the extratropics ({cite.14.'Joshi_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Bell_et_al_2009}). There is growing evidence that future NAO projections are sensitive to how climate models resolve stratospheric processes and {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere}–stratosphere interactions ({cite.14.'Sigmond_and_Scinocca_2010}; {cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2011a}; {cite.14.'Karpechko_and_Manzini_2012}).

Several recent studies of historical data have found a positive association between {Glossary.*Solar_activity solar activity} and NAO ({cite.14.'Haigh_and_Roscoe_2006}; {cite.14.'Kodera_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Lockwood_et_al_2010}), while other studies have found little imprint of solar and volcanic forcing on NAO ({cite.14.'Casty_et_al_2007}). Positive associations between NAO and solar forcing have been reproduced in recent modelling studies ({cite.14.'Lee_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Ineson_et_al_2011}) but no significant changes were found in CMIP5 projections of NAO due to changes in solar irradiance or {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} forcing.

Observational studies have noted weakening of NAO during periods of reduced Arctic sea ice ({cite.14.'Strong_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Wu_and_Zhang_2010}). Several modelling studies have also shown a negative NAO response to the partial removal of sea ice in the Arctic or high latitudes ({cite.14.'Kvamsto_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Magnusdottir_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Seierstad_and_Bader_2009}; Deser et al., 2010c; {cite.14.'Screen_et_al_2012}). However, the strength and timing of the response to sea ice loss varies considerably between studies, and can be hard to separate from common responses to warming of the troposphere and from natural climate variability. The impact of sea ice loss in individual years on NAO is small and hard to detect ({cite.14.'Bluthgen_et_al_2012}). Reviews of the emerging literature on this topic can be found in {cite.14.'Budikova_2009 Budikova (2009)} and {cite.14.'Bader_et_al_2011 Bader et al. (2011)}.

The NPO contributes to the excitation of ENSO events via the ‘Seasonal Footprinting Mechanism’ (SFM; {cite.14.'Anderson_2003}; {cite.14.'Vimont_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Alexander_et_al_2010}). Some studies indicate that warm events in the central tropical Pacific Ocean may in turn excite the NPO (Di Lorenzo et al., 2009).

Recent multi-model studies of NAO ({cite.14.'Hori_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Karpechko_2010}; {cite.14.'Zhu_and_Wang_2010}; {cite.14.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013}) reconfirm the small positive response of boreal winter NAO indices to GHG forcing noted in earlier studies reported in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.14.'Kuzmina_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Miller_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Stephenson_et_al_2006}). Projected trends in wintertime NAO indices are generally found to have small amplitude compared to natural internal variations ({cite.14.'Deser_et_al_2012}). Furthermore, there is substantial variation in NAO projections from different climate models. For example, one study found no significant NAO trends in two simulations with the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model (Fischer-Bruns et al., 2009), whereas another study found a strong positive trend in NAO in the ECHAM5/MPI-OM SRES A1B simulations (Müller and Roeckner, 2008). The model dependence of the response is an important source of {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the regional climate change response ({cite.14.'Karpechko_2010}). A multi-model study of 24 {Topics.*Climate_Projections climate model projections} suggests that there are no major changes in the NPO due to greenhouse warming ({cite.14.'Furtado_et_al_2011}).

{'Figure_14_16 Figures 14.16}a, b summarize the wintertime NAO and NAM indices simulated by models participating in the CMIP5 experiment ({cite.14.'Gillett_and_Fyfe_2013}). The multi-model mean of the NAO and NAM indices are similar and exhibit small linear trends in agreement with those shown for the NAM index in AR4 (AR4, {'Figure_10_17 Figure 10.17}a). The multi-model mean projected increase of around 1 to 2 hPa from 1850 to 2100 is smaller than the spread of around 2 to 4 hPa between model simulations ({'Figure_14_16 Figure 14.16}).

Some differences in model projections can be accounted for by changes in the NAO spatial pattern, for example, northeastward shifts in NAO centres of action have been found to be important for estimating the trend in the NAO index ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_and_Christoph_1999}; {cite.14.'Hu_and_Wu_2004}). Individual model simulations have shown the spatial extent of NAO influence decreases with GHG forcing (Fischer-Bruns et al., 2009), a positive {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} between jet and {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} that enhances a poleward shift in the NAO pattern ({cite.14.'Choi_et_al_2010}), and changes in the NAO pattern but with no changes in the propagation conditions for Rossby waves ({cite.14.'Brandefelt_2006}). One modelling study found a trend in the correlation between NAO and ENSO during the 21st century ({cite.14.'Muller_and_Roeckner_2006}). Such changes in the structure of NAO and/or its interaction with other modes of variability would could lead to important regional climate impacts.
