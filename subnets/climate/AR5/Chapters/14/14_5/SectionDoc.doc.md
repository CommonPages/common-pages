title: 14.5 - Annular and Dipolar Modes

The North Atlantic Oscillation ({Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO}), the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) and the Northern and Southern Annular Modes ({Glossary.*Northern_Annular_Mode NAM} and {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}) are dominant {Topics.*Climate_Variability modes of variability} in the extratropics. These modes are the focus of much research attention, especially in impact studies, where they are often used as aggregate descriptors of past {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} trends and variations over many parts of the world. For example, since {cite.14.'IPCC_2007a IPCC (2007a)} more than 2000 scientific articles have been published, which include NAO, AO, or NAM in either the title or abstract. This assessment focusses on recent research on these modes that is most relevant for future regional climate change. Past behaviour of these modes inferred from observations is assessed in {Chapters.2.2_7.2_7_8 Section 2.7.8}.
