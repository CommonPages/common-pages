title: 14.3.4 - Atlantic Ocean Modes

The Atlantic features a northward-displaced {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_1 Section 14.3.1.1}), and a cold tongue that develops in boreal summer. {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} generally fail to simulate these characteristics of tropical Atlantic climate ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_3 Section 9.5.3.3}). The biases severely limit model skill in simulating modes of Atlantic {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} and in projecting future climate change in the Atlantic sector. In-depth analysis of the CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of Atlantic Ocean Modes has not yet been fully explored, but see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_3 Section 12.4.3}.

The inter-hemispheric {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradient displays pronounced interannual to decadal variability ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}, {'Box_2_5_Figure_2 Figure 2}), referred to as the Atlantic meridional mode (AMM; {cite.14.'Servain_et_al_1999}; {cite.14.'Chiang_and_Vimont_2004}; {cite.14.'Xie_and_Carton_2004}). A thermodynamic {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} between surface winds, evaporation and SST (WES; {cite.14.'Xie_and_Philander_1994}) is fundamental to the AMM ({cite.14.'Chang_et_al_2006}). This mode affects precipitation in northeastern Brazil by displacing the ITCZ ({cite.14.'Servain_et_al_1999}; {cite.14.'Chiang_and_Vimont_2004}; {cite.14.'Xie_and_Carton_2004}), and Atlantic hurricane activity ({cite.14.'Vimont_and_Kossin_2007}; {cite.14.'Smirnov_and_Vimont_2011}).

The Atlantic Niño mode represents interannual variability in the equatorial cold tongue, akin to {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}, {'Box_2_5_Figure_2 Figure 2}). Bjerknes feedback is considered important for energizing the mode ({cite.14.'Zebiak_1993}; {cite.14.'Carton_and_Huang_1994}; {cite.14.'Keenlyside_and_Latif_2007}). This mode affects the West Africa {Glossary.*Monsoon Monsoon} ({cite.14.'Vizy_and_Cook_2002}; {cite.14.'Giannini_et_al_2003}).

Over the past century, the Atlantic has experienced a pronounced and persistent warming {Glossary.*Trend trend}. The warming has brought detectable changes in atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns in the region. In particular, the ITCZ has shifted southward and land precipitation has increased over the equatorial Amazon, equatorial West Africa, and along the Guinea coast, while it has decreased over the Sahel ({cite.14.'Deser_et_al_2010a}; {cite.14.'Tokinaga_and_Xie_2011}; see also Sections {Chapters.2.2_5 2.5} and {Chapters.2.2_7 2.7} ). Atlantic Niño variability has weakened by 40% in amplitude from 1960 to 1999, associated with a weakening of the equatorial cold tongue ({cite.14.'Tokinaga_and_Xie_2011}).

The CMIP3 20th century climate simulations generally capture the warming trend of the basin-averaged SST over the tropical Atlantic. A majority of the models also seem to capture the secular trend in the tropical Atlantic SST inter-hemispheric gradient and, as a result, the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ over the past century ({cite.14.'Chang_et_al_2011}).

Many CMIP3 model simulations with the A1B {Topics.*Emissions emission} scenario show only minor changes in the SST variance associated with the AMM. However, the few models that give the best AMM simulation over the 20th century project a weakening in future AMM activity ({cite.14.'Breugem_et_al_2006}), possibly due to the northward shift of the ITCZ ({cite.14.'Breugem_et_al_2007}). At present, model projections of future change in AMM activity is considered highly uncertain because of the poorly simulated Atlantic ITCZ. In fact, {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in projected changes in Atlantic meridional SST gradient limits the confidence in {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} projections surrounding the tropical Atlantic Ocean ({cite.14.'Good_et_al_2008}).

A majority of CMIP3 models forced with the A1B {Glossary.*Emission_scenario emission scenario} project no major change in Atlantic Niño activity in the 21st century, while a few models project a sizable decrease in future activity ({cite.14.'Breugem_et_al_2006}).

CMIP5 projections show an accelerated SST warming over much of the tropical Atlantic ({'Figure_12_11 Figure 12.11}). {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} projections of the inter-hemispheric SST gradient change within the basin, however, are not consistent among CMIP5 models as future GHG increase dominates over the {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} effect.
