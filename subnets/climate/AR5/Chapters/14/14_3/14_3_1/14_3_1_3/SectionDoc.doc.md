title: 14.3.1.3 - South Atlantic Convergence Zone

The South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) extends from the Amazon {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} through southeastern Brazil towards the Atlantic Ocean during austral summer ({cite.14.'Cunningham_and_Cavalcanti_2006}; {cite.14.'Carvalho_et_al_2011}; de Oliveira Vieira et al., 2013). Floods or dry conditions in southeastern Brazil are often related to SACZ variability ({cite.14.'Muza_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Lima_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Vasconcellos_and_Cavalcanti_2010}). A subset of CMIP models simulate the SACZ ({cite.14.'Vera_and_Silvestri_2009}; {cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Yin_et_al_2012}) and its variability as a dipolar structure (Junquas et al., 2012; {cite.14.'Cavalcanti_and_Shimizu_2012}).

A southward displacement of SACZ and intensification of the southern centre of the precipitation dipole are suggested in {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models ({cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}; Junquas et al., 2012; {cite.14.'Cavalcanti_and_Shimizu_2012}). This displacement is consistent with the increased precipitation over southeastern South America, south of 25°S, projected for the second half of the 21st century, in CMIP3, CMIP5 and regional models (Figure AI.34, {'Figure_14_21 Figure 14.21}). It is also consistent with the southward displacement of the Atlantic subtropical high ({cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}) related to the southward expansion of the Hadley Cell ({cite.14.'Lu_et_al_2007}). Pacific {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} warming and the strengthening of the Pacific–South American (PSA)-like wave train ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}) are potential mechanisms for changes in the dipolar pattern resulting in SACZ change (Junquas et al., 2012). This change is also supported by the intensification and increased frequency of the low level jet over South America in future projections ({cite.14.'Soares_and_Marengo_2009}; {cite.14.'Seth_et_al_2010}).
