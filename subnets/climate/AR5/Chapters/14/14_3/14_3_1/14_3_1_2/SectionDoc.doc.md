title: 14.3.1.2 - South Pacific Convergence Zone

The South Pacific Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*South_Pacific_Convergence_Zone SPCZ}, {cite.14.'Widlansky_et_al_2011}) extends southeastward from the tropical western Pacific to French Polynesia and the SH mid-latitudes, contributing most of the yearly rainfall to the many South Pacific island nations under its influence. The SPCZ is most pronounced during austral summer (December, January and February (DJF)).

Zonal and meridional {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} gradients, trade wind strength, and subsidence over the eastern Pacific are important mechanisms for SPCZ orientation and variability ({cite.14.'Takahashi_and_Battisti_2007}; {cite.14.'Lintner_and_Neelin_2008}; {cite.14.'Vincent_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Widlansky_et_al_2011}). Many {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} simulate the SPCZ as lying east–west, giving a ‘double-{Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}’ structure and missing the southeastward orientation ({cite.14.'Brown_et_al_2012a}).

The majority of CMIP models simulate increased austral summer mean precipitation in the SPCZ, with decreased precipitation at the eastern edge of the SPCZ ({cite.14.'Brown_et_al_2012a}; {cite.14.'Brown_et_al_2012b}). The position of the SPCZ varies on interannual to decadal time scales, shifting northeast in response to El Niño ({cite.14.'Folland_et_al_2002}; {cite.14.'Vincent_et_al_2011}). Strong El Niño events induce a zonally oriented SPCZ located well northeast of its average position, while more moderate {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) events are associated with movement of the SPCZ to the northeast or southwest, without a change in its orientation.

Models from both CMIP3 and CMIP5 that simulate the SPCZ well show a consistent tendency towards much more frequent zonally oriented SPCZ events in future ({cite.14.'Cai_et_al_2012b}). The mechanism appears to be associated with a reduction in near-equatorial meridional SST gradient, a robust feature of modelled SST response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} ({cite.14.'Widlansky_et_al_2013}). An increased frequency of zonally oriented SPCZ events would have major implications for {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate}, possibly leading to longer dry spells in the southwest Pacific.
