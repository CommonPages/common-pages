title: 14.3.1 - Convergence Zones

{Chapters.7.7_6 Section 7.6} presents a radiative perspective of changes in {Glossary.*Convection convection} (including the differences between GHG and {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings}), and {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5.12_4_5_2 Section 12.4.5.2} discusses patterns of precipitation change on the global scale. The emphasis here is on regional aspects of tropical changes. Tropical convection over the oceans, averaged for a month or longer, is organized into long and narrow convergence zones, often anchored by {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} structures. Latent heat release in convection drives atmospheric circulation and affects global climate. In {Topics.*Climate_Modelling model experiments} where spatially uniform SST warming is imposed, precipitation increases in these tropical convergence zones ({cite.14.'Xie_et_al_2010b}), following the ‘wet-get-wetter’ paradigm ({cite.14.'Held_and_Soden_2006}). On the flanks of a convergence zone, rainfall may decrease because of the increased horizontal gradient in {Glossary.*Specific_humidity specific humidity} and the resultant increase in dry {Glossary.*Advection advection} into the convergence zone ({cite.14.'Neelin_et_al_2003}).

Although these arguments based on moist atmospheric dynamics call for changes in tropical convection to be organized around the climatological rain band, studies since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} show that such changes in a warmer climate also depend on the spatial pattern of SST warming. As a result of the SST pattern effect, rainfall change does not generally project onto the climatological convergence zones, especially for the annual mean. In CMIP3/5 model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, annual rainfall change over tropical oceans follows a ‘warmer-get-wetter’ pattern, increasing where the SST warming exceeds the tropical mean and vice versa ({'Figure_14_8 Figure 14.8}, {cite.14.'Xie_et_al_2010b}; {cite.14.'Sobel_and_Camargo_2011}; {cite.14.'Chadwick_et_al_2013}). Differences among models in the SST warming pattern are an important {Glossary.*Source source} of uncertainty in rainfall projections, accounting for a third of inter-model variability in annual precipitation change in the tropics ({cite.14.'Ma_and_Xie_2013}).

{'Figure_14_8 Figure 14.8} presents selected indices for several robust patterns of SST warming for {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5}. They include greater warming in the NH than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), a pattern favouring rainfall increase at locations north of the equator and decreases to the south ({cite.14.'Friedman_et_al_2013}); enhanced equatorial warming ({cite.14.'Liu_et_al_2005}) that anchors a pronounced rainfall increase in the equatorial Pacific; reduced warming in the subtropical Southeast Pacific that weakens convection there; decreased zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific (see {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) and increased westward SST gradient across the equatorial Indian Ocean (see {Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_3 Section 14.3.3}) that together contribute to the weakened Walker cells.

Changes in tropical convection affect the pattern of SST change ({cite.14.'Chou_et_al_2005}) and such atmospheric and oceanic perturbations are inherently coupled. The SST pattern effect dominates the annual rainfall change while the wet-get-wetter effect becomes important for seasonal mean rainfall in the summer hemisphere ({cite.14.'Huang_et_al_2013}). This is equivalent to an increase in the annual range of precipitation in a warmer climate ({cite.14.'Chou_et_al_2013}). Given {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in SST warming pattern, the confidence is generally higher for seasonal than annual mean changes in tropical rainfall.
