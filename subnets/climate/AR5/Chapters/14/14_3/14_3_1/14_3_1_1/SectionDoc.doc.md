title: 14.3.1.1 - Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone

The Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ({Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}) is a zonal band of persistent low-level convergence, atmospheric {Glossary.*Convection convection}, and heavy rainfall. Over the Atlantic and eastern half of the Pacific, the ITCZ is displaced north of the equator due to ocean–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} interaction ({cite.14.'Xie_et_al_2007}) and extratropical influences ({cite.14.'Kang_et_al_2008}; Fučkar et al., 2013). Many models show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific and Atlantic, with excessive rainfall south of the equator ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_2.9_4_2_5.9_4_2_5_1 Section 9.4.2.5.1}). This bias needs to be kept in mind in assessing ITCZ changes in model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, especially for boreal spring when the model biases are largest.

The global zonal mean ITCZ migrates back and forth across the equator following the sun. In CMIP5, seasonal mean rainfall is projected to increase on the equatorward flank of the ITCZ ({'Figure_14_9 Figure 14.9}). The co-migration of rainfall increase with the ITCZ is due to the wet-get-wetter effect while the equatorward displacement is due to the {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} pattern effect ({cite.14.'Huang_et_al_2013}).
