title: 14.3.3 - Indian Ocean Modes

The tropical Indian Ocean {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} exhibits two modes of interannual variability ({cite.14.'Schott_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Deser_et_al_2010b}): the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) mode featuring a basin-wide structure of the same sign, and the Indian Ocean Dipole ({Glossary.*Indian_Ocean_Dipole IOD}) mode with largest amplitude in the eastern Indian Ocean off Indonesia, and weaker anomalies of the opposite polarity over the rest of the basin ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}). Both modes are statistically significantly correlated with {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}). CMIP models simulate both modes well ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_4.9_5_3_4_2 Section 9.5.3.4.2}).

The formation of IOB is linked to ENSO via an atmospheric bridge and surface heat {Glossary.*Flux_adjustment flux adjustment} ({cite.14.'Klein_et_al_1999}; {cite.14.'Alexander_et_al_2002}). Ocean–{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} interactions within the Indian Ocean are important for the long persistence of this mode ({cite.14.'Izumo_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Wu_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Du_et_al_2009}). The basin mode affects the termination of ENSO events ({cite.14.'Kug_and_Kang_2006}), it induces coherent atmospheric anomalies in the summer following El Niño ({cite.14.'Xie_et_al_2009}), including supressed {Glossary.*Convection convection} ({cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2003}) and reduced tropical cyclone activity ({cite.14.'Du_et_al_2011}) over the Northwest Pacific and anomalous rainfall over East Asia ({cite.14.'Huang_et_al_2004}).

IOD develops in July to November and involves Bjerknes {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} between zonal SST gradient, zonal wind and {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} tilt along the equator ({cite.14.'Saji_et_al_1999}; {cite.14.'Webster_et_al_1999}). A positive IOD event (with negative SST anomalies off Sumatra) is associated with droughts in Indonesia, reduced rainfall over Australia, intensified Indian summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon}, increased precipitation in East Africa and anomalous conditions in the extratropical SH ({cite.14.'Yamagata_et_al_2004}). Most CMIP3 models are able to reproduce the general features of the IOD, including its phase lock onto the July to November season, while detailed analysis of CMIP5 simulations are not yet available ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_4.9_5_3_4_2 Section 9.5.3.4.2})

Basin-mean SST has risen steadily for much of the 20th century, a {Glossary.*Trend trend} captured by CMIP3 20th century simulations ({cite.14.'Alory_et_al_2007}). The SST increase over the North Indian Ocean since about 1930 is noticeably weaker than for the rest of the basin. This spatial pattern is suggestive of the effects of reduced surface {Glossary.*Solar_radiation solar radiation} due to Asian brown clouds ({cite.14.'Chung_and_Ramanathan_2006}) and it affects Arabian Sea cyclones ({cite.14.'Evan_et_al_2011b}). In the equatorial Indian Ocean, coral isotope records off Indonesia indicate a reduced SST warming and/or increased salinity during the 20th century ({cite.14.'Abram_et_al_2008}). From ship-borne surface measurements, an easterly wind change especially during July to October has been observed over the past six decades, a result consistent with a reduction of marine cloudiness in the east and a decreasing precipitation trend over the maritime continent ({cite.14.'Tokinaga_et_al_2012}). Atmospheric {Topics.*Reanalysis reanalysis} products have difficulty representing these changes ({cite.14.'Han_et_al_2010}).

The projected changes over the equatorial Indian Ocean include easterly wind anomalies, a shoaling thermocline ({cite.14.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007a}; {cite.14.'Du_and_Xie_2008}) and reduced SST warming in the east ({cite.14.'Stowasser_et_al_2009}), a result confirmed by CMIP5 multi-model analysis ({cite.14.'Zheng_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_14_10 Figure 14.10}). The change in zonal SST gradient, in turn, reinforces the easterly wind change, indicative of a positive feedback between them as envisioned by {cite.14.'Bjerknes_1969 Bjerknes (1969)}. This coupled pattern is most pronounced during July to November, and is broadly consistent with the observed changes in the equatorial Indian Ocean.

In one CMIP3 model, the IOB mode and its capacitor effect persist longer, through summer into early fall towards the end of the century (2081–2100, {cite.14.'Zheng_et_al_2011}). This increased persistence intensifies ENSO’s influence on the Northwest Pacific summer monsoon. The confidence level of this relationship is low due to the lack of multi-model studies.

The IOD variability in SST remains nearly unchanged in future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of CMIP3 and CMIP5 ({cite.14.'Ihara_et_al_2009}; {'Figure_14_11 Figure 14.11}a) despite the easterly wind change that lifts the thermocline ({'Figure_14_10 Figure 14.10}b) and intensifies thermocline feedback on SST in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The global increase in atmospheric dry static stability weakens the atmospheric response to zonal SST gradient changes, countering the enhanced thermocline feedback ({cite.14.'Zheng_et_al_2010}). The weakened atmospheric feedback is reflected in a decrease in IOD variance in both zonal wind and the thermocline depth ({cite.14.'Zheng_et_al_2013}; {'Figure_14_11 Figure 14.11}b, c ).
