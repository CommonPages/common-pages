title: 14.3.2 - Madden–Julian Oscillation

The {Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO} is the dominant mode of tropical intraseasonal (20 to 100 days) variability ({cite.14.'Zhang_2005}). The MJO modulates tropical cyclone activity ({cite.14.'Frank_and_Roundy_2006}), contributes to intraseasonal fluctuations of the monsoons ({cite.14.'Maloney_and_Shaman_2008}), and excites {Glossary.*Teleconnection teleconnection} patterns outside the tropics (L’Heureux and Higgins, 2008; {cite.14.'Lin_et_al_2009}). Simulation of the MJO by {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} remains challenging, but with some improvements made in recent years ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2.9_5_2_3 Section 9.5.2.3}).

Possible changes in the MJO in a future warmer climate have just begun to be explored with models that simulate the phenomenon. In the Max Planck Institute {Topics.*Climate_System Earth System} Model, MJO variance increases appreciably with increasing warming ({cite.14.'Schubert_et_al_2013}). The change in MJO variance is highly sensitive to the spatial pattern of {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} warming ({cite.14.'Maloney_and_Xie_2013}). In light of the low skill in simulating MJO, and its sensitive to SST warming pattern, which in itself is subject to large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}, it is currently not possible to assess how the MJO will change in a warmer climate.
