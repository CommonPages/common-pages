title: 14.3.5 - Assessment Summary

There is medium confidence that annual rainfall changes over tropical oceans follow a ‘warmer-get-wetter’ pattern, increasing where the {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} warming exceeds the tropical mean and vice versa. One third of inter-model differences in precipitation {Glossary.*Projection projection} are due to those in SST pattern. The SST pattern effect on precipitation change is a new finding since {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}.

The wet-get-wetter effect is more obvious in the seasonal than annual rainfall change in the tropics. Confidence is generally higher in seasonal than in annual mean changes in tropical precipitation. There is medium confidence that seasonal rainfall will increase on the equatorward flank of the current {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ}; that the frequency of zonally oriented {Glossary.*South_Pacific_Convergence_Zone SPCZ} events will increase, with the SPCZ lying well to the northeast of its average position during those events; and that the SACZ shifts southwards, in conjunction with the southward displacement of the South Atlantic subtropical high, leading to an increase in precipitation over southeastern South America.

Owing to models’ ability to reproduce general features of {Glossary.*Indian_Ocean_Dipole IOD} and agreement on future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, it is likely that the tropical Indian Ocean will feature a zonal pattern with reduced (enhanced) warming and decreased (increased) rainfall in the east (west), a pattern especially pronounced during August to November. The Indian Ocean dipole mode will very likely remain active, with interannual variability unchanged in SST but decreasing in {Glossary.*Thermocline thermocline} depth. There is low confidence in changes in the summer persistence of the Indian Ocean SST response to {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} and in ENSO’s influence on summer climate over the Northwest Pacific and East Asia.

The observed SST warming in the tropical Atlantic represents a reduction in spatial variation in climatology: the warming is weaker north than south of the equator; and the equatorial cold tongue weakens both in the mean and interannual variability. There is low confidence in projected changes over the tropical Atlantic, both for the mean and interannual modes, because of large errors in model simulations of current climate.

There is low confidence in how {Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO} will change in the future due to the poor skill of models in simulating MJO and the sensitivity of its change to SST warming patterns that are themselves subject to large {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} in the projections.
