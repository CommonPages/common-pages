title: 14.7.5 - Quasi-Biennial Oscillation

The {Glossary.*Quasi_Biennal_Oscillation QBO} is a near-periodic, large-amplitude, downward propagating oscillation in zonal winds in the equatorial {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} ({cite.14.'Baldwin_et_al_2001}). It is driven by vertically propagating internal waves that are generated in the tropical {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({cite.14.'Plumb_1977}). The QBO has substantial effects on the global stratospheric circulation, in particular the strength of the northern stratospheric polar vortex as well as the extratropical troposphere ({cite.14.'Boer_2009}; {cite.14.'Marshall_and_Scaife_2009}; {cite.14.'Garfinkel_and_Hartmann_2011}). These extratropical effects occur primarily in winter when the stratosphere and troposphere are strongly coupled ({cite.14.'Anstey_and_Shepherd_2008}; {cite.14.'Garfinkel_and_Hartmann_2011}).

It has been unclear how the QBO will respond to future climate change related to GHG increase and recovery of stratospheric {Glossary.*Ozone ozone}. {Topics.*Climate_Modelling Climate models} assessed in the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} did not simulate the QBO as they lacked the necessary vertical {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} ({cite.14.'Kawatani_et_al_2011}). Recent model studies without using gravity wave {Glossary.*Parameterization parameterization} ({cite.14.'Kawatani_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Kawatani_et_al_2012}) showed that the QBO period and amplitude may become longer and weaker, and the downward penetration into the lowermost stratosphere may be more curtailed in a warmer climate. This finding is {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to the effect of increased equatorial upwelling (stronger {Glossary.*Brewer_Dobson_circulation Brewer–Dobson circulation}; {cite.14.'Butchart_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Garcia_and_Randel_2008}; {cite.14.'McLandress_and_Shepherd_2009}; {cite.14.'Okamoto_et_al_2011}) dominating the effect of increased wave {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} (more convective activity). Two studies with gravity wave parameterization, however, gave conflicting results depending on the simulated changes in the intensity of the Brewer–Dobson circulation ({cite.14.'Watanabe_and_Kawatani_2012}).

There are limited published results on the future behaviour of the QBO, using CMIP5 models. On the basis of the recent literature, it is uncertain how the period or amplitude of the QBO may change in future and confidence in the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} remains low.
