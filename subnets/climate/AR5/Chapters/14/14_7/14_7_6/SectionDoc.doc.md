title: 14.7.6 - Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation

The {Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO} ({Box_2_5 Box 2.5}; see also {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_3.9_5_3_3.9_5_3_3_2 Section 9.5.3.3.2}) is a fluctuation seen in the instrumental {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} record throughout the North Atlantic Ocean and is related to variability in the {Glossary.*Thermohaline_circulation thermohaline circulation} ({cite.14.'Knight_et_al_2005}). Area-mean North Atlantic SST shows variations with a range of about 0.4°C (see {Box_2_5 Box 2.5}) and a warming of a similar magnitude since 1870. The AMO has a quasi-periodicity of about 70 years, although the approximately 150-year instrumental record possesses only a few distinct phases—warm during approximately 1930–1965 and after 1995, and cool between 1900–1930 and 1965–1995. The phenomenon has also been referred to as ‘Atlantic Multidecadal Variability’ to avoid the implication of temporal regularity. Along with secular trends and Pacific variability, the AMO is one of the principal features of multidecadal variability in the instrumental climate record.

The {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} highlighted a number of important links between the AMO and {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climates}. Subsequent research using observational and {Glossary.*Paleoclimate paleoclimate} records, and {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models}, has confirmed and expanded upon these connections, such as West African {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} and Sahel rainfall ({cite.14.'Mohino_et_al_2011}; {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_4 Section 14.2.4}), summer climate in North America ({cite.14.'Seager_et_al_2008}; {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_3 Section 14.8.3}; {cite.14.'Feng_et_al_2011}) and Europe ({cite.14.'Folland_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Ionita_et_al_2012}; {Chapters.14.14_8.14_8_6 Section 14.8.6}), the Arctic ({cite.14.'Chylek_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Mahajan_et_al_2011}), and Atlantic major hurricane frequency ({cite.14.'Chylek_and_Lesins_2008}; {cite.14.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2009}; {Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 Section 14.6.1}). Further, the list of AMO influences around the globe has been extended to include decadal variations in many other regions (e.g., {cite.14.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2006}; {cite.14.'Kucharski_et_al_2009a}, 2009b; {cite.14.'Huss_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Marullo_et_al_2011}; Wang et al., 2011).

Paleo reconstructions of Atlantic temperatures show AMO-like variability well before the instrumental era, as noted in the AR4 ({Chapters.6 Chapter 6}; see also {Chapters.5.5_4.5_4_2 Section 5.4.2}). Recent analyses confirm this, and suggest potential for intermittency in AMO variability ({cite.14.'Saenger_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Zanchettin_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Chylek_et_al_2012}). Control simulations of climate models run for hundreds or thousands of years also show long-lived Atlantic multi-decadal variability ({cite.14.'Menary_et_al_2012}). These lines of evidence suggest that AMO variability will continue into the future. No fundamental changes in the characteristics of North Atlantic multi-decadal variability in the 21st century are seen in CMIP3 models ({cite.14.'Ting_et_al_2011}).

Many studies have diagnosed a {Glossary.*Trend trend} towards a warm North Atlantic in recent decades additional to that implied by global climate {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} ({cite.14.'Knight_2009}; {cite.14.'Polyakov_et_al_2010}). It is unclear exactly when the current warm phase of the AMO will terminate, but may occur within the next few decades, leading to a cooling influence in the North Atlantic and offsetting some of the effects characterizing global warming ({cite.14.'Keenlyside_et_al_2008}; see also {Chapters.11.11_3.11_3_3.11_3_3_3 Section 11.3.3.3}).

Some similarity in the shape of the instrumental time series of global and NH mean {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} and the AMO has long been noted. By removing an estimate of the effect of interannual variability phenomena like {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}), AMO transitions have been shown to have the potential to produce large and abrupt changes in hemispheric temperatures ({cite.14.'Thompson_et_al_2010}). Estimates of the AMO’s contribution to recent climate change are uncertain, however, as {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} of the observed AMO requires a model (physical or conceptual) whose assumptions are nearly always difficult to verify ({cite.14.'Knight_2009}).
