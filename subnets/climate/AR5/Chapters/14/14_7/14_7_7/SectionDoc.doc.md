title: 14.7.7 - Assessment Summary

Literature is generally insufficient to assess future changes in behaviour of the {Glossary.*Pacific_North_American_pattern PNA}, PSA, TBO, {Glossary.*Quasi_Biennal_Oscillation QBO} and {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}/IPO. Confidence in the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of changes in these modes is therefore low. However, process understanding of the formation of the PSA gives medium confidence that future changes in the mean atmospheric circulation for austral summer will project on the PSA pattern thereby influencing the SACZ and precipitation over Southeastern South America.

{Glossary.*Paleoclimate Paleoclimate} reconstructions and long model simulations indicate that the {Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO} is unlikely to change its behaviour in the future as the mean climate changes. However, natural fluctuations in the AMO over the coming few decades are likely to influence {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climates} at least as strongly as will human-induced changes.
