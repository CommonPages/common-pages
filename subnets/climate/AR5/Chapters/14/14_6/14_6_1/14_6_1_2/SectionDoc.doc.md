title: 14.6.1.2 - Regional Numerical Projections

Similar to observational analyses, confidence in numerical simulations of tropical cyclone activity (Supplementary Material Tables 14.SM.1 to 14.SM.4) is reduced when model spatial domain is reduced from global to {Topics.*Regional_Climate region}-specific (IPCC SREX {Box_3_2 Box 3.2}; see also {Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_4.9_5_4_3 Section 9.5.4.3}). The assessment provided by {cite.14.'Knutson_et_al_2010 Knutson et al. (2010)} of {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} based on the SRES A1B scenario concluded that it is likely that the global frequency of tropical cyclones will either decrease or remain essentially unchanged while mean intensity (as measured by maximum wind speed) increases by +2 to +11% and tropical cyclone rainfall rates increase by about 20% within 100 km of the cyclone centre. However, inter-model differences in regional projections lead to lower confidence in basin-specific projections, and confidence is particularly low for projections of frequency within individual basins. For example, a recent study by {cite.14.'Ying_et_al_2012 Ying et al. (2012)} showed that numerical projections of 21st century changes in tropical cyclone frequency in the western North Pacific range broadly from –70% to +60%, while there is better model agreement in measures of mean intensity and precipitation, which are projected to change in the region by –3% to +18% and +5% to +30%, respectively. The available modelling studies that are capable of producing very strong cyclones typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones and it is more likely than not that this increase will be larger than 10% in some basins ({cite.14.'Emanuel_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Bender_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Knutson_et_al_2010}, 2013; {cite.14.'Yamada_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Murakami_et_al_2012}). It should be emphasized that this {Glossary.*Metric metric} is generally more important to physical and societal impacts than overall frequency or mean intensity.

As seen in Tables 14.SM.1 to 14.SM.4 of the Supplementary Material, as well as the previous assessments noted above, model projections often vary in the details of the models and the experiments performed, and it is difficult to objectively assess their combined results to form a consensus, particularly by region. It is useful to do this after normalizing the model output using a combination of objective and subjective expert judgements. The results of this are shown in {'Figure_14_17 Figure 14.17}, and are based on a subjective normalization of the model output to four common metrics under a common future scenario projected through the 21st century. The global assessment is essentially the same as {cite.14.'Knutson_et_al_2010 Knutson et al. (2010)} and the assessment of projections in the western North Pacific is essentially unchanged from {cite.14.'Ying_et_al_2012 Ying et al. (2012)}. The annual frequency of tropical cyclones is generally projected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged in the next century in most regions although as noted above, the confidence in the projections is lower in specified regions than global projections. The decrease in storm frequency is apparently related to a projected decrease of upward deep convective mass flux and increase in the saturation deficit of the middle {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} in the tropics associated with global warming ({cite.14.'Bengtsson_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Emanuel_et_al_2008}, 2012; {cite.14.'Zhao_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Held_and_Zhao_2011}; {cite.14.'Murakami_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Sugi_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Sugi_and_Yoshimura_2012}).

A number of experiments that are able to simulate intense tropical cyclones project increases in the frequency of these storms in some regions, although there are presently only limited studies to assess and there is insufficient data to draw from in most regions to make a confident assessment ({'Figure_14_17 Figure 14.17}). Confidence is somewhat better in the North Atlantic and western North Pacific basins where an increase in the frequency of the strongest storms is more likely than not. The models generally project an increase in mean {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime}-maximum intensity of simulated storms (Supplementary Material Table 14.SM.3), which is consistent with a projected increase in the frequency in the more intense storms ({cite.14.'Elsner_et_al_2008}). The projected increase in intensity concurrent with a projected decrease in frequency can be argued to result from a difference in scaling between projected changes in surface enthalpy fluxes and the {Glossary.*Clausius_Clapeyron_equation_relationship Clausius–Clapeyron} relationship associated with the moist static energy of the middle troposphere ({cite.14.'Emanuel_et_al_2008}). The increase in rainfall rates associated with tropical cyclones is a consistent feature of the numerical models under greenhouse warming as atmospheric moisture content in the tropics and tropical cyclone moisture convergence is projected to increase ({cite.14.'Trenberth_et_al_2005}, 2007a; {cite.14.'Allan_and_Soden_2008}; {cite.14.'Knutson_et_al_2010}, 2013). Although no broad-scale, detectable long-term changes in tropical cyclone rainfall rates have been reported, preliminary evidence for a detectable {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} increase in atmospheric moisture content over ocean regions has been reported by {cite.14.'Santer_et_al_2007 Santer et al. (2007)}.

A number of studies since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} have attempted to project future changes in tropical cyclone tracks and genesis at interor intra-basin scale ({cite.14.'Leslie_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007b}; {cite.14.'Emanuel_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Yokoi_and_Takayabu_2009}; {cite.14.'Zhao_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Li_et_al_2010b}; {cite.14.'Murakami_and_Wang_2010}; {cite.14.'Lavender_and_Walsh_2011}; {cite.14.'Murakami_et_al_2011a}, 2013). These studies suggest that projected changes in tropical cyclone activity are strongly correlated with projected changes in the spatial pattern of tropical {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} ({cite.14.'Sugi_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Chauvin_and_Royer_2010}; {cite.14.'Murakami_et_al_2011b}; {cite.14.'Zhao_and_Held_2012}) and associated weakening of the Pacific {Glossary.*Walker_Circulation Walker Circulation} ({cite.14.'Vecchi_and_Soden_2007a}), indicating that reliable projections of regional tropical cyclone activity depend critically on the reliability of the projected pattern of SST changes. However, assessing changes in regional tropical cyclone frequency is still limited because confidence in projections critically depend on the performance of control simulations ({cite.14.'Murakami_and_Sugi_2010}), and current {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} still fail to simulate observed temporal and spatial variations in tropical cyclone frequency ({cite.14.'Walsh_et_al_2012}). As noted above, tropical cyclone genesis and track variability is modulated in most regions by known modes of {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean variability. The details of the relationships vary by region (e.g., El Niño events tend to cause track shifts in western North Pacific typhoons and tend to suppress Atlantic storm genesis and development). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that accurate modelling of tropical cyclone activity fundamentally depends on the model’s ability to reproduce these {Topics.*Climate_Variability modes of variability} (e.g., {cite.14.'Yokoi_and_Takayabu_2009}). Reliable projections of future tropical cyclone activity, both global and regional, will then depend critically on reliable projections of the behaviour of these modes of variability (e.g., {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}) under global warming, as well as an adequate understanding of their physical links with tropical cyclones. At present there is still {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in their projected behaviours (e.g., {Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}).

The reduction in signal-to-noise ratio that accompanies changing focus from global to regional scales also lengthens the emergence time scale (i.e., the time required for a {Glossary.*Trend trend} signal to rise above the natural variability in a statistically significant way). Based on changes in tropical cyclone intensity {Topics.*Climate_Predictions predicted} by idealized numerical simulations with carbon dioxide ({Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2})-induced tropical SST warming, {cite.14.'Knutson_and_Tuleya_2004 Knutson and Tuleya (2004)} suggested that clearly detectable increases may not be manifest for decades to come. The more recent high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} dynamical {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} study of {cite.14.'Bender_et_al_2010 Bender et al. (2010)} supports this argument and suggests that the predicted increases in the frequency of the strongest Atlantic storms may not emerge as a statistically significant signal until the latter half of the 21st century under the SRES A1B emissionscenario. However, regional {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} by agents other than {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs}, such as anthropogenic aerosols, is known to affect the regional climatic conditions differently (e.g., {cite.14.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2009}), and there is evidence that tropical cyclone activity may have changed in some regions because of effects from anthropogenic {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} pollution. The fidelity of the emergence time scales projected under A1B warming thus depends on the fidelity of A1B aerosol projections, which are known to be uncertain ({cite.14.'Forster_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Haerter_et_al_2009}).
