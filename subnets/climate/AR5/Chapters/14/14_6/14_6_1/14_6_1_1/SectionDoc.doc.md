title: 14.6.1.1 - Understanding the Causes of Past and Projected Regional Changes

{Glossary.*Detection_and_Attribution Detection} of past trends in measures of tropical cyclone activity is constrained by the quality of historical records and uncertain quantification of natural variability in these measures ({cite.14.'Knutson_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Lee_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). Observed {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} variability generally represents a complex convolution of natural and {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} factors, and the response of tropical cyclones to each factor is not yet well understood (see also {Chapters.10.10_6.10_6_1.10_6_1_5 Section 10.6.1.5} and Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.4.1.2). For example, the steady long-term increase in tropical Atlantic {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} due to increasing {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas GHGs} can be dominated by shorter-term decadal variability forced by both external and internal factors ({cite.14.'Mann_and_Emanuel_2006}; {cite.14.'Baines_and_Folland_2007}; {cite.14.'Evan_et_al_2009}, 2011a; {cite.14.'Ting_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Zhang_and_Delworth_2009}; {cite.14.'Chang_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Solomon_and_Newman_2011}; {cite.14.'Booth_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Camargo_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Villarini_and_Vecchi_2012}). Similarly, tropical upper-tropospheric temperatures, which modulate tropical cyclone potential intensity ({cite.14.'Emanuel_2010}), can be forced by slowly evolving changes in the stratospheric circulation of {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} ({Glossary.*Brewer_Dobson_circulation Brewer–Dobson circulation}) due to climate change with occasional large amplitude and persistent changes forced by volcanic eruptions ({cite.14.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2009}; {cite.14.'Evan_2012}). This convolution of anthropogenic and natural factors, as represented in a {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model}, has also been shown to be useful in {Topics.*Climate_Predictions prediction} of Atlantic tropical storm frequency out to a few years ({cite.14.'Smith_et_al_2010}).

In addition to greenhouse warming {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, tropical cyclones can also respond to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} via different and possibly unexpected pathways. For example, increasing anthropogenic {Topics.*Emissions emissions} of {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon} and other aerosols in South Asia has been linked to a reduction of SST gradients in the Northern Indian Ocean ({cite.14.'Chung_and_Ramanathan_2006}; {cite.14.'Meehl_et_al_2008}), which has in turn been linked to a weakening of the vertical wind shear in the region. {cite.14.'Evan_et_al_2011b Evan et al. (2011b)} linked the reduced wind shear to the observed increase in the number of very intense storms in the Arabian Sea, including five very severe cyclones that have occurred since 1998, but the fundamental cause of this proposed linkage is not yet certain ({cite.14.'Evan_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Wang_et_al_2012a}). Furthermore, it is possible that a substantial part of the multi-decadal variability of North Atlantic SST is radiatively forced, via the cloud {Glossary.*Albedo albedo} effect, by what are essentially pollution aerosols emitted from North America and Europe ({cite.14.'Baines_and_Folland_2007}; {cite.14.'Booth_et_al_2012}), although the relative contribution of this forcing to the observed variability has been questioned ({cite.14.'Zhang_et_al_2013b}). Note that in the North Atlantic, the evidence suggests that the reduction of pollution aerosols is linked to tropical SST increases, while in the northern Indian Ocean, increases in {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} pollution have been linked to reduced vertical wind shear. Both of these effects (increasing SST and reduced shear) have been observed to be related to increased tropical cyclone activity.

Finally, in addition to interannual-to-multi-decadal forcing of tropical Atlantic SST via radiative dimming ({cite.14.'Evan_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Evan_et_al_2011a}), dust aerosols have a large and more immediate in situ effect on the regional thermodynamic and kinematic environment ({cite.14.'Dunion_and_Marron_2008}; {cite.14.'Dunion_2011}), and Saharan dust storms—whose frequency has been linked to atmospheric {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide CO2} concentration ({cite.14.'Mahowald_2007})—have also been linked to reduced strengthening of tropical cyclones ({cite.14.'Dunion_and_Velden_2004}; {cite.14.'Wu_2007}). Direct in situ relationships have also been identified between aerosol pollution concentrations and tropical cyclone structure and intensity ({cite.14.'Khain_et_al_2008}, 2010; {cite.14.'Rosenfeld_et_al_2011}). Thus, when assessing changes in tropical cyclone activity, it is clear that detection and {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attribution} aimed simply at long-term linear trends forced by increasing {Topics.*The_Greenhouse_Effect well-mixed GHGs} is not adequate to provide a complete picture of the potential anthropogenic contributions to the changes in tropical cyclone activity that have been observed ({Chapters.10.10_6 Section 10.6}).
