title: 14.6.1 - Tropical Cyclones

The potential for regional changes in future tropical cyclone frequency, track and intensity is of great interest, not just because of the associated negative effects, but also because tropical cyclones can play a major role in maintaining regional water resources ({cite.14.'Jiang_and_Zipser_2010}; {cite.14.'Lam_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Prat_and_Nelson_2012}). Past and {Topics.*Climate_Projections projected} increases in human exposure to tropical cyclones in many regions ({cite.14.'Peduzzi_et_al_2012}) heightens the interest further.
