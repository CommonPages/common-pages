title: 14.6.2.2 - Regional Projections

Large-scale {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of ETCs are assessed in {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4.12_4_4_3 Section 12.4.4.3}. This section complements this by presenting a more detailed assessment of regional changes.

Individual model projections of regional storm track changes are often comparable with the magnitude of interannual natural variability and so the changes are expected to be relevant for {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate}. However, the magnitude of the response is model dependent at any given location, especially over land ({cite.14.'Harvey_et_al_2012}). There is also disagreement between different cyclone/storm track identification methods, even when applied to the same data ({cite.14.'Raible_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}), although in the response to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing}, these differences appear mainly in the statistics of weak cyclones ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2013}). Conversely, when the same method is applied to different models the spread between the model responses is often larger than the {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} mean response, especially in the NH ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Laine_et_al_2009}).

The poleward shift of the SH storm track remains one of the most reproducible projections, yet even here there is considerable quantitative uncertainty. This is partly associated with the varied model biases in jet latitude ({cite.14.'Kidston_and_Gerber_2010}) although factors such as the varied cloud response may play a role ({cite.14.'Trenberth_and_Fasullo_2010}). Many models project a similar poleward shift in the North Pacific ({cite.14.'Bengtsson_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Catto_et_al_2011}), although this is often weaker compared to natural variability and often varies considerably between ensemble members ({cite.14.'Pinto_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'McDonald_2011}). Poleward shifts are generally less clear at the surface than in the upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} ({cite.14.'Yin_2005}; {cite.14.'McDonald_2011}; {cite.14.'Chang_et_al_2012}), which reduces their relevance for regional impacts. However, a shift in extreme surface winds is still detectable in the zonal mean, especially in the subtropics and the southern high latitudes ({cite.14.'Gastineau_and_Soden_2009}). A weakening of the Mediterranean storm track is a particularly robust response ({cite.14.'Pinto_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Loeptien_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Donat_et_al_2011}) for which increasing static stability is important ({cite.14.'Raible_et_al_2010}). In general, the storm track response in summer is weaker than in winter with less consistency between models ({cite.14.'Lang_and_Waugh_2011}).

The response of the North Atlantic storm track is more complex than a poleward shift in many models, with an increase in storm activity and a downstream extension of the storm track into Europe ({cite.14.'Bengtsson_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Pinto_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Catto_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'McDonald_2011}). In some models this regional response is important ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}), with storm activity over Western Europe increasing by 50% ({cite.14.'McDonald_2011}) or by an amount comparable to the natural variability ({cite.14.'Pinto_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Woollings_et_al_2012}). The return periods of intense cyclones are shortened (Della-Marta and Pinto, 2009) with impact on potential wind damage ({cite.14.'Leckebusch_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Donat_et_al_2011}) and economic losses ({cite.14.'Pinto_et_al_2012}). This response is related to the local minimum in warming in the North Atlantic ocean, which serves to increase the meridional temperature gradient on its southern side ({cite.14.'Laine_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Catto_et_al_2011}). The minimum in warming arises due to the weakening of northward ocean heat transports by the Atlantic {Glossary.*Meridional_Overturning_Circulation Meridional Overturning Circulation} (AMOC), and the varying AMOC responses of the models can account for a large fraction of the variance in the Atlantic storm track projections ({cite.14.'Woollings_et_al_2012}). CMIP5 models show a similar, albeit weaker extension of the storm track towards Europe, flanked by reductions in cyclone activity on both the northern and southern sides ({cite.14.'Harvey_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Zappa_et_al_2013b}). Despite large biases in the mean state, the model responses were found to agree with one another within sampling variation caused by natural variability ({cite.14.'Sansom_et_al_2013}). {cite.14.'Colle_et_al_2013 Colle et al. (2013)} noted similar reductions but also found that the higher {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} CMIP5 models gave more realistic ETC performance in the historical period. The best 7 models were found to give projections of increased 10 to 20% increase in cyclone track density over the eastern USA, including 10 to 40% more intense (<980 hPa) cyclones.

There is general agreement that there will be a small global reduction in ETC numbers ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}). In individual regions there can be much larger changes which are comparable to natural variations, but these changes are not reproduced by the majority of the models (e.g., {cite.14.'Donat_et_al_2011}). ETC intensities are particularly sensitive to the method and quantity used to define them, so there is little consensus on changes in intensity ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}). While there are indications that the absolute values of pressure minima deepen in future scenario simulations ({cite.14.'Lambert_and_Fyfe_2006}), this is often associated with large-scale pressure changes rather than changes in the pressure gradients or winds associated with ETCs ({cite.14.'Bengtsson_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'McDonald_2011}). The CMIP5 model projections show little {Topics.*Evidence_of_Change evidence of change} in the intensity of winds associated with ETCs ({cite.14.'Zappa_et_al_2013b}).

There are systematic storm track biases common to many models, which might have some influence on the projected storm track response to forcing ({cite.14.'Chang_et_al_2012}). Some models with improved representation of the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} have shown a markedly different circulation response in the NH, with consequences for Atlantic/European storm activity in particular ({cite.14.'Scaife_et_al_2011a}). Concerns over the skill of many models in representing both the stratosphere and the ocean mean that confidence in NH storm track projections remains low. Higher horizontal resolution can improve ETC representation, yet there are still relatively few high-resolution global models which have been used for storm track projections ({cite.14.'Geng_and_Sugi_2003}; {cite.14.'Bengtsson_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Catto_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Colle_et_al_2013}; {cite.14.'Zappa_et_al_2013a}). Several studies have used {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} to simulate storms at high resolution in particular regions. In multi-model experiments over Europe, the ETC response is more sensitive to the choice of driving {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} than the choice of RCM ({cite.14.'Leckebusch_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Donat_et_al_2011}), highlighting the importance of large-scale circulation {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties}. There has been little work on potential changes to mesoscale storm systems, although it has been suggested that polar lows may reduce in frequency due to an increase in static stability (Zahn and von Storch, 2010). Higher resolution runs of one {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} also suggest an increase in intensity of autumn ETCs due to increased transitioning of Atlantic hurricanes ({cite.14.'Haarsma_et_al_2013}).
