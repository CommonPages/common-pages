title: 14.6.2.1 - Process Understanding of Future Changes

Future storm track change is the result of several different competing dynamical influences ({cite.14.'Held_1993}; O’Gorman, 2010; {cite.14.'Woollings_2010}). It is becoming apparent that the relatively modest storm track response in many models reflects the partial cancelling of opposing tendencies ({cite.14.'Son_and_Lee_2005}; {cite.14.'Lim_and_Simmonds_2009}; {cite.14.'Butler_et_al_2010}).

One of the most important factors is the change in the meridional temperature gradient from which ETCs draw most of their energy. This gradient is projected to increase in the upper {Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} due to tropical amplification and decrease in the lower troposphere due to polar amplification, and it is still unclear whether this will lead to an overall increase or decrease in ETC activity. The projected response can involve an increase in eddy activity at upper levels and a decrease at lower levels (Hernandez-Deckers and von Storch, 2010), although in other models changes in low level eddy activity are more in line with the upper level wind changes ({cite.14.'Mizuta_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Wu_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Mizuta_2012}). The projected warming pattern also changes vertical temperature gradients leading to increased stability at low latitudes and decreased stability at higher latitudes, and there is some modelling evidence that this may be a strong factor in the response ({cite.14.'Lu_et_al_2008}, 2010; {cite.14.'Kodama_and_Iwasaki_2009}; {cite.14.'Lim_and_Simmonds_2009}). Increasing depth of the troposphere might also be important for future changes ({cite.14.'Lorenz_and_DeWeaver_2007}).

Uncertainties in the {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} of large-scale warming contribute to {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in the storm track response ({cite.14.'Rind_2008}). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} respond to the large-scale changes, including changes in eddy phase speed ({cite.14.'Chen_et_al_2007}, 2008; {cite.14.'Lu_et_al_2008}), eddy {Glossary.*Source source} regions ({cite.14.'Lu_et_al_2010}) and eddy length scales ({cite.14.'Kidston_et_al_2011}) with a subsequent effect on wave-breaking characteristics ({cite.14.'Riviere_2011}). Furthermore, changes in the large-scale warming might also be partly due to changes in the storm tracks due to the two-way coupling between storm tracks and the large-scale flow. However, there is evidence that the amplitude of the tropical and polar warming are largely determined by atmospheric poleward heat fluxes set by local processes ({cite.14.'Hwang_and_Frierson_2010}).

Local processes could prove important for the storm track response in certain regions, for example, {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} loss ({cite.14.'Kvamsto_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Seierstad_and_Bader_2009}; Deser et al., 2010c; {cite.14.'Bader_et_al_2011}) and spatial changes in SSTs ({cite.14.'Graff_and_LaCasce_2012}). Local land–sea contrast in warming also has a local influence on baroclinicity along the eastern continental coastlines ({cite.14.'Long_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'McDonald_2011}). It is not clear how the storm track responds to multiple {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcings} with some studies suggesting a linear response ({cite.14.'Lim_and_Simmonds_2009}) while others suggest more complex interaction ({cite.14.'Butler_et_al_2010}).

The projected increase in moisture content in a warmer {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is also likely to have competing effects. Latent heating has been shown to play a role in invigorating individual ETCs, especially in the downstream development over eastern ocean ({cite.14.'Dacre_and_Gray_2009}; {cite.14.'Fink_et_al_2009}, 2012). However, there is evidence that the overall effect of moistening is to weaken ETCs by improving the efficiency of poleward heat transport and hence reducing the dry baroclinicity ({cite.14.'Frierson_et_al_2007}; O’Gorman and Schneider, 2008; {cite.14.'Schneider_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Lucarini_and_Ragone_2011}). Consistent with this, studies have shown that precipitation is projected to increase in ETCs despite no increase in wind speed intensity of ETCs ({cite.14.'Bengtsson_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Zappa_et_al_2013b}).
