title: 14.6.2 - Extratropical Cyclones

Some agreement on the response of {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} to {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing anthropogenic forcing} started to emerge in the {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} from CMIP3, with many models projecting a poleward shift of the storm tracks ({cite.14.'Yin_2005}) and an expansion of the tropics ({cite.14.'Lu_et_al_2007}). As stated in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} ({cite.14.'Meehl_et_al_2007}) this response is particularly clear in the SH, but less clear in the NH. Although clearer in zonal mean responses ({cite.14.'Yin_2005}), regional responses at different longitudes differ widely from this in many models ({cite.14.'Ulbrich_et_al_2008}). There is a strong two-way coupling between storm tracks and the large-scale circulation ({cite.14.'Lorenz_and_Hartmann_2003}; {cite.14.'Robinson_2006}; {cite.14.'Gerber_and_Vallis_2007}), which results in associated shifts in storm tracks and westerly jet streams ({cite.14.'Raible_2007}; {cite.14.'Athanasiadis_et_al_2010}).
