title: 14.8.5 - South America

South America (SA) is affected by several climate phenomena. {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) and Atlantic Ocean modes ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_4 Section 14.3.4}) have a role in interannual variability of many regions. The SAMS ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_3.14_2_3_2 Section 14.2.3.2}) is responsible for rainfall over large areas, while the SACZ ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_3 Section 14.3.1.3}) and Atlantic {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_1 Section 14.3.1.1}) also affect precipitation. Teleconnections such as the PSA ({Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_1 Section 14.7.1}), the {Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM} ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}) with related ETCs ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}) and the {Glossary.*Indian_Ocean_Dipole IOD} ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_3 Section 14.3.3}) also influence {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability}. {'Table_14_3 Table 14.3} summarizes the main phenomena and their assessed relevance to climate change over SA.

Positive minimum temperature trends have been observed in SA ({cite.14.'Alexander_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Marengo_and_Camargo_2008}; {cite.14.'Rusticucci_and_Renom_2008}; {cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Skansi_et_al_2013}). Glacial retreat in the tropical Andes was observed in the last three decades ({cite.14.'Vuille_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Rabatel_et_al_2013}). In contrast to the warming over the continental interior, a prominent but localized coastal cooling was detected during the past 30 to 50 years, extending from central Peru (Gutiérrez et al., 2011) to northern ({cite.14.'Schulz_et_al_2012}) and central Chile ({cite.14.'Falvey_and_Garreaud_2009}). Observed precipitation changes include a significant increase in precipitation during the 20th century over the southern sector of southeastern SA, a negative {Glossary.*Trend trend} in SACZ continental area ({Chapters.2.2_5.2_5_1 Section 2.5.1}; {cite.14.'Barros_et_al_2008}), a negative trend in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes in central-southern Chile, and a positive trend in southern Chile ({cite.14.'Haylock_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Quintana_and_Aceituno_2012}). Other detected changes include positive extreme precipitation trends in southeastern SA, central-northern Argentina and northwestern Peru and Ecuador ({Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_2 Section 2.6.2}; {cite.14.'Haylock_et_al_2006}; {cite.14.'Dufek_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Re_and_Barros_2009}; {cite.14.'Skansi_et_al_2013}).

{'Table_14_2 Table 14.2} provides an overall assessment of {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation and main phenomena in the sub-regions of SA. In general, GCM results are consistent with observed temperature tendencies (e.g., {cite.14.'Haylock_et_al_2006}). Trends toward warmer nights in CMIP3 models ({cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2010b}; {cite.14.'Rusticucci_et_al_2010}) are consistent with observed trends. CMIP3 models, however, do not simulate the cooling ocean and warming land trends observed in the last 30 years along subtropical western SA noted above. The number of warm nights in SA is well represented in CMIP5 simulations ({cite.14.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). CMIP5 models reproduce the annual cycle of precipitation over SA, though the multi-model mean underestimates rainfall over some areas ({'Figure_9_38 Figure 9.38}). In tropical SA, rainy season precipitation is better reproduced in the CMIP5 {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} than CMIP3 ({'Figure_9_39 Figure 9.39}). CMIP3 models were able to simulate extreme precipitation indices over SA ({cite.14.'Rusticucci_et_al_2010}), but CMIP5 models improved them globally ({cite.14.'Sillmann_et_al_2013}). CMIP5 also improved simulations of precipitation indices in the SAMS {Topics.*Regional_Climate region} ({cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}; {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_3.14_2_3_2 Section 14.2.3.2}). The main precipitation features are well represented by regional models in several areas of SA ({cite.14.'Solman_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Alves_and_Marengo_2010}; {cite.14.'Chou_et_al_2012}; {cite.14.'Solman_et_al_2013}). However, regional models underestimate daily precipitation intensity in the La Plata Basin and in eastern Northeastern SA in DJF and almost over the whole continent in JJA ({cite.14.'Carril_et_al_2012}).

Regarding future {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections}, CMIP5 models indicate higher temperatures over all of SA, with the largest changes in southeastern Amazonia by century’s end. (Figures AI.28, AI.29, {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}). Temperature changes projected by {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} forced by a suite of CMIP3 models agree that the largest warming occurs over the southern Amazon during austral winter. Regional models project a greater frequency of warm nights over SA, except in parts of Argentina, and a reduction of cold nights over the whole continent ({cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2009}). CMIP5 projections confirm the results of CMIP3 in {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} and SREX (see {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_9 Section 12.4.9}).

CMIP5 results confirm precipitation changes projected by CMIP3 models in the majority of SA regions, with increased confidence, as more models agree in the changes (AI.30, AI.34, AI31, AI35). Inter-{Glossary.*Model_spread model spread} in precipitation also decreased in some SA regions from CMIP3 to CMIP5 (Blázquez and Nuñez, 2012). CMIP5 precipitation projections for the end of the twenty-first century (2081–2100) show a precipitation increase from October to March over the southern part of Southeast Brazil and the La Plata Basin, the extreme south of Chile, the northwest coast of SA, and the Atlantic ITCZ, extending to a small area of the northeastern Brazil coast (Figures AI.30 and AI.34). Reduced October to March rainfall is projected in the extreme northern region of SA, eastern Brazil, and central Chile. In eastern Amazonia and northeastern Brazil, CMIP5 models show both drying and moistening. This {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} can also be seen in {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}.

{'Figure_14_20 Figure 14.20} confirms that changes in northwestern, southwestern and southeastern SA are consistent among CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles and a high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} model ensemble, which gives more confidence in these results. However, in eastern Amazonia and northeast and eastern

{image:'Figure_14_20}

Brazil, there is less agreement. Results from high-resolution or regional models forced by CMIP3 models provides further indication the projected changes are robust. A high-resolution regional model ensemble projects precipitation increases during austral summer over the La Plata Basin region, northwestern SA and southernmost Chile, and a decrease over northern SA, eastern Amazonia, eastern Brazil, central Chile and the Altiplano ({'Figure_14_21 Figure 14.21}). Other regional models also project a precipitation increase over the Peruvian coast and Ecuador and a reduction in the Amazon Basin ({cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2010b}; {cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2012}).

From April to September, the CMIP5 ensemble projects precipitation increases over the La Plata Basin and northwestern SA near the coast (Figures AI31, AI35). In contrast, a reduction is projected for northeast Brazil and eastern Amazonia. Precipitation is projected to decrease in Central Chile, but to increase over extreme southern areas. In CMIP3 models, a precipitation reduction in the central Andes resulted from a moisture transport decrease from the continental interior to the Altiplano ({cite.14.'Minvielle_and_Garreaud_2011}). CMIP3 and CMIP5 models are consistent in projecting drier conditions in eastern Amazonia during the dry season and wetter conditions in western Amazonia ({cite.14.'Malhi_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Cook_et_al_2011}). The Amazon {Glossary.*Forest forest}’s future is discussed in {Chapters.12.12_5.12_5_5.12_5_5_6.12_5_5_6_1 Section 12.5.5.6.1}. Areas of maximum change in CMIP5 are consistent with those of CMIP3 in JJA, agreeing also with a high-resolution model ensemble ({'Figure_14_20 Figure 14.20}). Increased precipitation in southeastern SA is projected by a high-resolution model ensemble in all four seasons (Blázquez et al., 2012). The austral winter precipitation increase over the La Plata Basin and southern Chile, and the reduction in eastern Amazonia and northeast Brazil, are also projected by RCMs ({'Figure_14_21 Figure 14.21}) as in CMIP5 models. A relevant result from a RCM is the precipitation decrease over most of SA north of 20°S in austral spring, suggesting a longer dry season (Sörensson et al., 2010; see also {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_3.14_2_3_2 Section 14.2.3.2}). Note that average CMIP5 spatial values in {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1} are consistent with changes seen in the maps, unless for the west coast of SA, where there are spatial variations within the area and the values do not reflect the changes.

Regional model projections and a high-resolution model ensemble indicate an increase in the number of consecutive dry days in northeastern SA ({cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2011}). An increase in heavy precipitation events over almost the entire continent, especially Amazonia, southern Brazil and northern Argentina, is projected by a high-resolution model ensemble ({cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2011}) and in subtropical areas of South America by regional models ({cite.14.'Marengo_et_al_2009}). {cite.14.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012 Seneviratne et al. (2012)} indicated low to medium confidence in CMIP3 SA precipitation trends. However, the increased ability of CMIP5 models to represent extremes ({cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2013}) provides higher confidence in the signals discussed above ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_3.14_2_3_2 Section 14.2.3.2}), consistent with global changes in land areas ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_5 Section 12.4.5}).

Precipitation changes projected over SA are consistent with El Niño influences, for example, rainfall increase over southeastern and northwestern SA and decrease over eastern Amazonia. However, CMIP3 models could not represent certain features of ENSO well ({cite.14.'Roxy_et_al_2013}) and there is no consensus about future ENSO behaviour ({cite.14.'Coelho_and_Goddard_2009}; {cite.14.'Collins_et_al_2010}) even with CMIP5 results ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}). As the various types of ENSO produce different impacts on SA ({cite.14.'Ashok_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Hill_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Tedeschi_et_al_2013}), future ENSO effects remain uncertain. It is very likely that ENSO remains the dominant mode of interannual variability in the future ({Chapters.14.14_4.14_4_2 Section 14.4.2}). Therefore, regions in SA currently influenced by Pacific {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} will continue to experience ENSO effects on precipitation and temperature.

Projected precipitation increases in the southern sector of southeastern SA are consistent with changes in the SACZ dipole ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1.14_3_1_3 Section 14.3.1.3}) and PSA ({Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_1 Section 14.7.1}). Increased precipitation in this region may also have a contribution from a more frequent and intense Low Level Jet (Nuñez et al., 2009; {cite.14.'Soares_and_Marengo_2009}). CMIP3 model analyses show little impact on extreme precipitation from SAM changes toward century’s end, except in Patagonia ({cite.14.'Menendez_and_Carril_2010}). However, the southward shift of stormtracks associated with the SAM’s projected positive trend ({cite.14.'Reboita_et_al_2009}; {Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}) impacts zones of cyclogenesis off the southeast SA coast ({cite.14.'Kruger_et_al_2011}; {Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_4 Section 12.4.4} ).

In summary, it is very likely temperatures will increase over the whole continent, with greatest warming projected in southern Amazonia. It is likely there will be an increase (reduction) in frequency of warm (cold) nights in most regions. It is very likely precipitation will increase in the southern sector of southeastern and northwestern SA, and decrease in Central Chile and extreme north of the continent. It is very likely that less rainfall will occur in eastern Amazonia, northeast and eastern Brazil during the dry season. However, in the rainy season there is medium confidence in the precipitation changes over these regions. There is high confidence in an increase of precipitation extremes.
