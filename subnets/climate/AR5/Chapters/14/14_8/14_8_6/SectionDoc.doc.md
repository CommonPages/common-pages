title: 14.8.6 - Europe and Mediterranean

This section assesses regional climate change in Europe and the North African and West Asian rims of the Mediterranean basin. Area-average summaries are presented for the three sub-regions of Northern Europe (NEU), Central Europe (CEU) and Mediterranean (MED) (cf. {'Table_14_1 Tables 14.1} to 14.2).

The most relevant climate phenomena for this region are {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_1 Section 14.5.1}), ETCs ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}) and {Glossary.*Blocking blocking} ({Box_14_2 Box 14.2}, {cite.14.'Folland_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Feliks_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Dole_et_al_2011}; Mariotti and Dell’Aquila, 2012). These phenomena also interact with longer time-scale North Atlantic ocean-{Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} phenomena such as the {Glossary.*Atlantic_Multi_decadal_Oscillation_Variability AMO} ({Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_6 Section 14.7.6}, Mariotti and Dell’Aquila, 2012; {cite.14.'Sutton_and_Dong_2012}). Other phenomena have minor influence in limited sectors of the region (see Supplementary Material Section 14.SM.6.3).

Recent 1981-2012 trends in annual mean temperature in each subregion exceed the global mean land {Glossary.*Trend trend} as can be inferred from {'Figure_2_22 Figure 2.22}. Consistent with previous {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} conclusions ({Chapters.11.11_3 Section 11.3}), recent studies of extreme events ({Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_1 Section 2.6.1}) point to a very likely increase of the number of warm days and nights, and decrease of the number of {Topics.*Extreme_Events cold days and nights}, since 1950 in Europe. Heat waves can be amplified by drier soil conditions resulting from warming ({cite.14.'Vautard_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Seneviratne_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Hirschi_et_al_2011}). Several studies ({Chapters.2.2_6.2_6_2.2_6_2_1 Section 2.6.2.1}) also indicate general increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation especially in winter during the last four decades however there are inconsistencies between studies, regions and seasons.

The ability of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} to simulate the climate in this region has improved in many important aspects since AR4 (see {'Figure_9_38 Figure 9.38}). Particularly relevant for this region are increased model {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} and a better representation of the land surface processes in many of the models that participated in the recent CMIP5 experiment. {'Table_14_2 Table 14.2} provides an assessment of the CMIP5 quality for simulations of temperature, precipitation, and main phenomena in the region. The CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} reveal warming in all seasons for the three sub-regions, while precipitation projections are more variable across sub-regions and seasons. In the winter half year (October to March), NEU and CEU are projected to have increased mean precipitation associated with increased atmospheric moisture, increased moisture convergence and intensification in ETC activity ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2} and {'Table_14_3 Table 14.3}) and no change or a moderate reduction in the MED. In the summer half year (April to September) , NEU and CEU mean precipitation are projected to have only small changes whereas there is a notable reduction in MED (see {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}, Figures AI.36 to AI.37 and AI.42-AI.43). {'Figure_14_22 Figure 14.22} illustrates that the precipitation changes are broadly consistent with the findings CMIP3.

High-resolution projections from the Japanese high-resolution model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} also agree with these findings and are consistent with {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} results from coordinated multi-model {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM}/{Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCM} experiments (e.g., ENSEMBLES, Déqué et al., 2012). In general, regional climate change amplitudes for temperature and precipitation follow the global warming amplitude although modulated both by changes in the large-scale circulation and by regional {Glossary.*Feedback feedback} processes ({cite.14.'Kjellstrom_et_al_2011}), which confirms assessments in AR4 ({cite.14.'Christensen_et_al_2007}).

Some new investigations have focussed on the {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} associated with model projections. A large ensemble of RCM-GCM shows that the temperature response is robust in spite of a considerable uncertainty related to choice of model combination (GCM/RCM) and sampling (natural variability), even for the 2021–2050 time frame (Déqué et al., 2012). Other studies based on CMIP3 projections suggest that GHG-forced changes in the MED are likely to become distinguishable from the ‘noise’ created by internal decadal variations in decades beyond 2020–2030 ({cite.14.'Giorgi_and_Bi_2009}). It has been also shown using an ensemble of RCM simulations that the removal of NAO-related variability leads to an earlier emergence of change in seasonal mean temperatures for some regions in Europe (Kjellström et al., 2013). Hence, in the near term, decadal {Glossary.*Predictability predictability} is likely to be critically dependent on the regional impacts of {Topics.*Climate_Variability modes of variability} ‘internal’ to the climate system ({Chapters.11.11_3 Section 11.3}). However, it has been shown that NAO trends do not account for a large fraction of the long-term future change in mean temperature or precipitation ({cite.14.'Stephenson_et_al_2006}) and that largescale atmospheric circulation changes in CMIP5 models are not the main driver of the warming projected in Europe by the end of the century (2081–2100; {cite.14.'Cattiaux_et_al_2013}). Therefore, changes in climate phenomena contribute to the uncertainty in the near-term projections rather than long-term changes in this region ({'Table_14_3 Table 14.3}), further supporting the credibility in model {Glossary.*Projection projection} ({'Table_14_2 Table 14.2}).

Recent studies have clearly identified a possible amplification of temperature extremes by changes in {Glossary.*Soil_moisture soil moisture} ({cite.14.'Jaeger_and_Seneviratne_2010}; {cite.14.'Hirschi_et_al_2011}), acting as a mechanism that further magnifies the intensity and frequency of heat waves given the projected enhance of summer drying conditions. This is in line with the assessed results presented in SREX ({cite.14.'Seneviratne_et_al_2012}). At the other end of the spectrum, studies indicate that European winter variability may be related to {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} reductions in the Barents-Kara Sea ({cite.14.'Petoukhov_and_Semenov_2010}) and CMIP5 models in projections for the future in general exhibit a similar relation until the summer sea ice has almost disappeared ({cite.14.'Yang_and_Christensen_2012}). Although the mechanism behind this relation remains unclear this suggests that cold winters in Europe will continue to occur in coming decades, despite an overall warming.

Although climate models have improved fidelity in simulating aspects of {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climates} over Europe and the Mediterranean, the spread in projections is still substantial, partly due to large amounts of natural variability in this region (particularly NAO and AMO), besides the inherent model deficiencies .

In summary, there is high confidence in model projections of mean temperature in this region. It is very likely that temperatures will continue to increase throughout the 21st century over all of Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is likely that winter mean temperature will rise more in NEU than in CEU or MED, whereas summer warming will likely be more intense in MED and CEU than in NEU. The length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells or heat waves are assessed to be very likely to increase throughout the whole region. There is medium confidence in an annual mean precipitation increase in NEU and CEU, while a decrease is likely in MED summer mean precipitation.
