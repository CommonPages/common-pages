title: 14.8.11 - South Asia

From June through September, the Indian summer {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_2.14_2_2_1 Section 14.2.2.1}) dominates South Asia, while the northeast winter monsoon contributes substantially to annual rainfall over southeastern India and Sri Lanka. The winter weather systems are also important in northern parts of South Asia, that is, the western Himalayas.

Seasonal mean rainfall shows interdecadal variability, noticeably a declining {Glossary.*Trend trend} with more frequent deficit monsoons ({cite.14.'Kulkarni_2012}). There are regional inhomogeneities: precipitation decreased over central India along the monsoon trough ({'Figure_14_25 Figure 14.25}) thought to be due to a number of factors ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_2 Section 14.2.2}) including {Glossary.*Black_carbon black carbon}, sulphate aerosols ({cite.14.'Chung_and_Ramanathan_2007}; {cite.14.'Bollasina_et_al_2011}), land use changes ({cite.14.'Niyogi_et_al_2010}) and {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} rise over the Indo-Pacific warm pool ({cite.14.'Annamalai_et_al_2013}). The increase in the number of monsoon break days over India ({cite.14.'Dash_et_al_2009}), and the decline in the number of monsoon depressions ({cite.14.'Krishnamurthy_and_Ajayamohan_2010}), are consistent with the overall decrease in seasonal mean rainfall. The frequency of heavy precipitation events is increasing ({cite.14.'Rajeevan_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Krishnamurthy_et_al_2009}; Sen Roy, 2009; {cite.14.'Pattanaik_and_Rajeevan_2010}), while light rain events are decreasing ({cite.14.'Goswami_et_al_2006}).

CMIP models reasonably simulate the annual cycle of precipitation and temperature over South Asia ({'Table_14_2 Table 14.2}; {'Figure_9_38 Figure 9.38}) but are limited in simulating fine structures of rainfall variability on sub-seasonal and sub-regional scales ({cite.14.'Turner_and_Annamalai_2012}). CMIP5 models show improved skill in simulating monsoon variability compared to CMIP3 ({cite.14.'Sperber_et_al_2012}; {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_2 Section 14.2.2}).

Summer precipitation changes in South Asia are consistent overall between CMIP3 and CMIP5 ({'Figure_14_24 Figure 14.24}), but model scatter is large in winter precipitation change ({'Figure_14_24 Figures 14.24} and AI.62). Changes in the summer monsoon dominate annual rainfall (see {Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_2 Section 14.2.2}). The CMIP3 multi-model {Glossary.*Ensemble ensemble} shows an increase in summer precipitation ({cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2011a}; {cite.14.'May_2011}; {cite.14.'Sabade_et_al_2011}), although there are wide variations among model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} ({cite.14.'Annamalai_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Kripalani_et_al_2007b}). Spatially, the rainfall increase is stronger over northern parts of South Asia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with a weak decrease over Pakistan ({cite.14.'Turner_and_Annamalai_2012}). In RCP6.0 and {Glossary.*RCP8_5 RCP8.5} {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios}, frequency of extreme precipitation days shows consistent increasing trends in 2060 and beyond ({cite.14.'Chaturvedi_et_al_2012}; Figure AI.63). In six CMIP3 models, precipitation anomalies during Indian summer monsoon breaks strengthen in a warmer climate, but changes in the timing and duration of active/break spells are variable among models ({cite.14.'Mandke_et_al_2007}). Note that the active/break spells of the monsoon are related to the {Glossary.*Madden_Julian_Oscillation MJO} (see {Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_2 Section 14.3.2}), a phenomenon that models simulate poorly ({Chapters.9.9_5.9_5_2.9_5_2_3 Section 9.5.2.3}; {cite.14.'Lin_et_al_2008a}; {cite.14.'Sperber_and_Annamalai_2008}).

High-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCM} and {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM} projections showed an overall increase of precipitation over a large area of peninsular India (Rupa Kumar et al., 2006; {cite.14.'Stowasser_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2011a}), but a significant reduction in orographic rainfall in both seasonal mean and {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events} on west coasts of India ({cite.14.'Rajendran_and_Kitoh_2008}; {cite.14.'Ashfaq_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2013}). Such spatial variations in projected precipitation near orography are noticeable in {'Figure_14_24 Figure 14.24} on the background of the overall increase.

CMIP5 models project a clear increase in temperature over India especially in winter (Figures AI.60 to AI.61), with enhanced warming during night than day ({cite.14.'Kumar_et_al_2011a}) and over northern India ({cite.14.'Kulkarni_2012}). In summer, extremely hot days and nights are projected to increase. {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1} summarizes the projected temperature and precipitation changes for SAS in the RCP4.5 scenario based on CMIP5.

In summary, there is high confidence in projected rise in temperature. There is medium confidence in summer monsoon precipitation increase in the future over South Asia. Model projections diverge on smaller regional scales.
