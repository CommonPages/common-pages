title: 14.8.15 - Antarctica

Much of the {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} of Antarctica is modulated by the Southern Annular Mode ({Glossary.*Southern_Annular_Mode SAM}, {Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}), the high-latitude atmospheric response to {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_4 Section 14.4}) and interactions between the two ({cite.14.'Stammerjohn_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Fogt_et_al_2011}; see also Sections {Chapters.2.2_7 2.7} and {Chapters.10.10_3.10_3_3 10.3.3}). Signatures of the SAM and ENSO in Antarctic temperature, snow {Glossary.*Accumulation accumulation} and {Glossary.*Sea_ice sea ice} have been documented by many observational and modelling studies ({cite.14.'Bromwich_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Guo_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Kaspari_et_al_2004}; van den Broeke and van Lipzig, 2004; {cite.14.'Marshall_2007}).

The positive SAM is associated on average with warmer conditions over the Peninsula and colder conditions over East Antarctica, with a mixed and generally non-significant impact over West Antarctica ({cite.14.'Kwok_and_Comiso_2002}; {cite.14.'Thompson_and_Solomon_2002}; van den Broeke and van Lipzig, 2004). ENSO is associated with circulation anomalies over the southeast Pacific that primarily affect West Antarctica ({cite.14.'Bromwich_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Guo_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Turner_2004}). ENSO variability tends to produce out-of-phase variations between the western and eastern sectors of West Antarctica ({cite.14.'Bromwich_et_al_2004}; {cite.14.'Kaspari_et_al_2004}), in association with the PSA pattern ({Chapters.14.14_7.14_7_1 Section 14.7.1}).

The positive summer/autumn {Glossary.*Trend trend} in the SAM index in recent decades ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}) has been related to the contrasting temperature trend patterns observed in these two seasons, with warming in the east and north of the Antarctic Peninsula and cooling (or no significant temperature change) over much of East Antarctica ({cite.14.'Turner_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Thompson_et_al_2011}). The high polarity of the SAM is also consistent with the significant increase in snow accumulation observed in the southern part of the Peninsula ({cite.14.'Thomas_et_al_2008}).

Unlike the eastern Antarctic Peninsula, its western coast shows maximum warming in austral winter (when the SAM does not exhibit any significant trend), which has been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to reduced sea ice concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea. Recent studies have emphasized the role of tropical {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} not directly linked to ENSO to explain the prominent springand wintertime atmospheric warming in West Antarctica ({cite.14.'Ding_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Schneider_et_al_2012}). There is further evidence of tropical SST influence on Antarctic temperatures and precipitation on decadal to inter-decadal time scales ({cite.14.'Monaghan_and_Bromwich_2008}; {cite.14.'Okumura_et_al_2012}).

Modelling of Antarctic climate remains challenging, in part because of the nature of the high-elevation {Glossary.*Ice_sheet ice sheet} in the east Antarctic and its effects on {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climate} ({Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_1.9_4_1_1 Section 9.4.1.1}). Moreover, modelling ice properties themselves, for both land ice and sea ice, is an area that is still developing despite improvements in recent years ({cite.14.'Vancoppenolle_et_al_2009}; {cite.14.'Picard_et_al_2012}; {Chapters.9.9_4.9_4_3 Section 9.4.3}). Modelling the role of the {Glossary.*Stratosphere stratosphere} and of {Glossary.*Ozone ozone} recovery is critical for Antarctic climate, as stratospheric change is intimately linked to trends in the SAM ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}).

The projected easing of the positive SAM trend in austral summer ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_2 Section 14.5.2}) may act to delay future loss of Antarctic sea ice ({cite.14.'Bitz_and_Polvani_2012}; {cite.14.'Smith_et_al_2012b}). It is unclear what effect ENSO will have on future Antarctic climate change as the ENSO response to climate change remains uncertain (see 12.4.4.1 and 14.5.2 for more information). Seasonally, changes in the strength of the circumpolar westerlies are also expected during the 21st century as a result of changes in the semi-annual oscillation caused by alterations in the midto high-latitude temperature gradient in the SH. {cite.14.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2008 Bracegirdle et al. (2008)} considered modelled circulation changes over the Southern Ocean and found a more pronounced strengthening of the autumn peak of the semi-annual oscillation compared with the spring peak.

Future changes in {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperature} over Antarctica are likely to be smaller than the global mean, and much smaller than those projected for the Arctic, because of the buffering effect of the southern oceans, and the thermal mass of the east Antarctic ice sheet ({Chapters.12.12_4.12_4_6 Section 12.4.6}). Warming is likely to bring increased precipitation on average across

Antarctica ({cite.14.'Bracegirdle_et_al_2008}), but the spatial pattern of precipitation change remains uncertain.

In summary, consistency across CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} suggests it is very likely that Antarctic temperatures will increase through the rest of the century, but more slowly than the global mean rate of increase ({'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}). SSTs of the oceans around Antarctica are likely to rise more slowly than surface air temperature over the Antarctic land mass. As temperatures rise, it is also likely that precipitation will increase ({'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}), up to 20% or more over the East Antarctic. However, given known difficulties associated with correctly modelling Antarctic climate, and {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainties} associated with future SAM and ENSO trends and the extent of Antarctic sea ice, precipitation projections have only medium confidence.
