title: 14.8.9 - East Asia

Summer is the rainy season for East Asia. The Meiyu-Changma-Baiu rain band is the defining feature of East Asian summer climate, extending from eastern China through central Japan ({cite.14.'Ding_and_Chan_2005}; {cite.14.'Zhou_et_al_2009b}). The summer rain band is anchored by the subtropical westerly jet ({cite.14.'Sampe_and_Xie_2010}), and located on the northwestern flank of the western North Pacific subtropical high ({cite.14.'Zhou_and_Yu_2005}). The wintertime circulation is characterized by monsoonal northerlies between the Siberian High and the Aleutian Low.

Both the East Asian summer and winter {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} circulations have experienced an inter-decadal scale weakening after the 1970s due to natural variability of the coupled climate system, leading to enhanced mean and extreme precipitation along the Yangtze River Valley (30°N) but deficient mean precipitation in North China in summer ({'Figure_14_25 Figure 14.25}), and a warmer climate in winter. The observed monsoon circulation changes are partly reproduced by {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCMs} driven by {Glossary.*Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation PDO}-related {Glossary.*Sea_Surface_Temperature SST} patterns but the quality of precipitation simulation is poor ({cite.14.'Zhou_et_al_2008a}; {cite.14.'Li_et_al_2010a}; {cite.14.'Zhou_and_Zou_2010}).

In {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4}, the regional warming is projected to be above the global mean in East Asia ({cite.14.'Christensen_et_al_2007}). “It is very likely that heat waves/hot spells in summer will be of longer duration, more intense and more frequent, but very cold days are very likely to decrease in frequency. The precipitation is likely to increase in both boreal winter and summer, while the frequency of intense precipitation events is very likely to increase. Extreme rainfall and winds associated with tropical cyclones are likely to increase”. CMIP5 results support many of these assessments.

More recent analysis suggested that CMIP3 models projected increased summer precipitation in amount and intensity over East Asia ({'Figure_14_24 Figure 14.24} for SRES A1B scenario) due to enhanced moisture convergence in a warmer climate ({cite.14.'Ding_et_al_2007}; {cite.14.'Sun_and_Ding_2010}; {cite.14.'Chen_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Kusunoki_and_Arakawa_2012}), along with an increase in interannual variability ({cite.14.'Lu_and_Fu_2010}). CMIP5 {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} for RCP4.5 support those from AR4 for summer ({'Figure_14_24 Figure 14.24}), with 90% of the models projecting a precipitation increase in the winter half year (see {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1} and Figures AI.56 to AI.59). CMIP3 models projections indicated a decrease of winter precipitation extending northeastward from South China Sea to south of Japan under SRES A1B scenario, changes seen in CMIP5 projections but with smaller spatial coverage ({'Figure_14_24 Figure 14.24}).

An increase of extreme precipitation is projected over East Asia in a warmer climate ({cite.14.'Jiang_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Lee_et_al_2011}; {cite.14.'Li_et_al_2011a}, 2011b). A high-{Glossary.*Resolution resolution} model projects an increase of Meiyu precipitation in May through July, Changma precipitation over Korean peninsula in May, and Baiu precipitation over Japan in July ({cite.14.'Kusunoki_and_Mizuta_2008}), and an increase of heavy precipitation over East Asia under SRES A1B scenario ({cite.14.'Kusunoki_and_Mizuta_2008}; {cite.14.'Endo_2012}). CMIP3 models project a late withdrawal of Baiu ({cite.14.'Kitoh_and_Uchiyama_2006}), as has been observed in eastern and western Japan ({cite.14.'Endo_2010}). There is a significant increase in mean, daily maximum and minimum temperatures in southeastern China, associated with a decrease in the number of frost days and an increase in the {Glossary.*Heat_wave heat wave} duration under SRES A2 scenario ({cite.14.'Chen_et_al_2011}). The CMIP5 model projections also indicate an increase of temperature in both boreal winter and summer over East Asia for RCP4.5 ({'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}). A decrease of the annual and seasonal maximum wind speeds is found under SRES A2 scenario due to both the reduced intensity of cold waves and the reduced intensity of the winter monsoons ({cite.14.'Jiang_and_Zhao_2013}). The future warming patterns simulated by {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} essentially follow those of the driving {Glossary.*Semi_empirical_model GCMs} (e.g., {cite.14.'Dairaku_et_al_2008}). For summer precipitation, however, RCM {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} usually shows different regional details due to more realistic topographic {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing forcing} than in GCMs ({cite.14.'Gao_et_al_2008}, 2012a). The {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} of precipitation {Glossary.*Projection projection} in eastern China is larger than that in western China ({cite.14.'Gao_et_al_2012b}). RCM downscaling indicates that both the seasonal mean summer rainfall and extreme precipitation around Japan Islands are projected to increase ({cite.14.'Im_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Iizumi_et_al_2012}).

Projections with a 5-km RCM show that the heaviest hourly precipitation is projected to increase even in the near future (2030s) when temperature increase is modest ({cite.14.'Kitoh_et_al_2009}). A southwest expansion of the subtropical anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific Ocean associated with El Niño-like mean state changes in the Pacific and a dry air intrusion in the mid-{Glossary.*Troposphere troposphere} from the Asian continent gives a favourable condition for intense precipitation in the Baiu season in Japan ({cite.14.'Kanada_et_al_2010}). Increased water vapour supply from the south of the Baiu front and an intensified frontal zone with intense mean updrafts contribute to the increased occurrence of intense daily precipitation during the late Baiu season ({cite.14.'Kanada_et_al_2012}).

In summary, based on CMIP5 model projections, there is medium confidence that with an intensified East Asian summer monsoon, summer precipitation over East Asia will increase ({'Table_14_3 Table 14.3}). Under RCP4.5 scenario, precipitation increase is likely over East Asia during the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu season in May to July, and precipitation extremes are very likely to increase over the eastern Asian continent in all seasons and over Japan in summer. However, there is only low confidence in more specific details of the projected changes due to the limited skill of CMIP5 models in simulating monsoon features such as the East Asian monsoon rainband ({'Table_14_2 Table 14.2}).
