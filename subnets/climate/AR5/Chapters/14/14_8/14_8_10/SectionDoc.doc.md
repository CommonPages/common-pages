title: 14.8.10 - West Asia

This region extends from the Mediterranean to the western fringes of South Asia, covering the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula and includes large areas of barren desert. The climate over this region varies from arid to semi-arid and precipitation is primarily received in the cold season.

The western part of the region is on the margin of Atlantic and Mediterranean influences, primarily the {Glossary.*North_Atlantic_Oscillation NAO} ({Chapters.14.14_5.14_5_1 Section 14.5.1}) during winter months, and indirectly the {Glossary.*Monsoon monsoon} heat low ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_2.14_2_2_1 Section 14.2.2.1}) in the summer months. Precipitation in this region comes largely from passing ETCs ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}). Land-falling TCs ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_1 Section 14.6.1}) that occasionally influence the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula are notable {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme events}. Pacific Ocean variability, associated with {Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO} ({Chapters.14.14_2.14_2_4 Section 14.2.4}), and the {Glossary.*Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone ITCZ} ({Chapters.14.14_3.14_3_1 Section 14.3.1}) are also known to impact weather and climate in different parts of West Asia.

In recent decades, there appears to be a weak but non-significant downward {Glossary.*Trend trend} in mean precipitation ({cite.14.'Zhang_et_al_2005}; {cite.14.'Alpert_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'AlSarmi_and_Washington_2011}; {cite.14.'Tanarhte_et_al_2012}), although intense weather events appear to be increasing ({cite.14.'Alpert_et_al_2002}; {cite.14.'Yosef_et_al_2009}). In contrast, upward temperature trends are notable and robust ({cite.14.'Alpert_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'AlSarmi_and_Washington_2011}; {cite.14.'Tanarhte_et_al_2012}).

The ability of {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate models} to simulate historical climate, its change and its variability, has improved in many important aspects since the {cite.1.'IPCC_2007 AR4} (see {'Figure_9_39 Figure 9.39} in {Chapters.9 Chapter 9}). CMIP5 models tend to be able to reproduce the basic climate state of the region as well as the main phenomena affecting it with some fidelity ({'Table_14_2 Table 14.2}), but the region is at the fringes of the influence of different drivers of European, Asian and African climates and remains poorly analysed in the peer-reviewed literature with respect to climate model performances.

The CMIP5 model {Topics.*Climate_Projections projections} for this century are for further warming in all seasons, while precipitation shows some distinct sub-regional and seasonally dependent changes, characterized by model scatter. In both winter (October to March) and summer (April to September) precipitation in general is projected to decrease, (see {'Table_14_1 Table 14.1}, Figures AI.52 to AI.55). However, the various interacting dynamical influences on precipitation of the region (that models have varying success in capturing in the current climate) results in {Topics.*Uncertainty uncertainty} in both the patterns and magnitude of future precipitation change. Indeed, while the overall pattern of change has remained the same between CMIP3 and CMIP5, the confidence has decreased somewhat and the boundary between the Mediterranean decreases and the general mid-latitude increase to the north has shifted closer to the region ({'Figure_14_26 Figures 14.26} and AI.54 to AI.55). So, although the Mediterranean side still appears likely to become drier, the likely precipitation changes for the interior land masses are less clear and the intensified and northward shifting ITCZ may imply an increase in precipitation in the most southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Overall, the projections by the end of the century (2081â€“2100) indicates little overall change, although with a tendency for reduced precipitation, particular in the high end {Topics.*Scenarios scenarios} (Figures AI.5 to AI.55). However, regardless of the sign of precipitation change in the high mountain regions of the interior, the influence of warming on the snow pack will very likely cause important changes in the timing and amount of the spring melt ({cite.14.'Diffenbaugh_et_al_2013}).

Recent {Glossary.*Downscaling downscaling} results ({cite.14.'Lionello_et_al_2008}; {cite.14.'Evans_2009}; {cite.14.'Jin_et_al_2010}; {cite.14.'Dai_2011}) suggest that the eastern Mediterranean will experience a decrease in precipitation during the rainy season due to a northward displacement of the {Glossary.*Storm_tracks storm tracks} ({Chapters.14.14_6.14_6_2 Section 14.6.2}). A northward shift in the ITCZ results in more precipitation in the southern part, not previously being seriously affected by it. A moderate change in the annual cycle of precipitation has also been simulated by some models. Precipitation and temperature statistics in {Glossary.*Regional_Climate_Model RCMs} for an area consisting of the western part of the Arab Peninsula was assessed by {cite.14.'Black_2009 Black (2009)} and {cite.14.'Onol_and_Semazzi_2009 Onol and Semazzi (2009)} confirming {Glossary.*General_Circulation_Model GCM}-based findings. Increased {Glossary.*Drought drought} duration has been projected ({cite.14.'Kim_and_Byun_2009}). Inland from the Mediterranean coastal areas, {Glossary.*Resolution resolution} of the terrain becomes more important and, while downscaled results ({cite.14.'Evans_2008}; {cite.14.'Marcella_and_Eltahir_2011}; {cite.14.'Lelieveld_et_al_2012}) broadly agree with GCM projections, higher resolution results in some differences associated with mountain barrier jets ({cite.14.'Evans_2008}; see also {'Figure_14_26 Figure 14.26}).

In summary, since AR4 climate models appear to have only modestly improved fidelity in simulating aspects of large-scale climate phenomena influencing {Topics.*Regional_Climate regional climates} over West Asia. Model agreement, however, indicates that it is very likely that temperatures will continue to increase. But at the same time, model agreement on projected precipitation changes have reduced, resulting in medium confidence in projections showing an overall reduction in precipitation.
