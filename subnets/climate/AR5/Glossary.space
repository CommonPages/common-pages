      | A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 μm that reside in the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} for at least several hours. For convenience the term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: directly through scattering and absorbing radiation (see {Glossary.*Aerosol Aerosol}–radiation interaction) and indirectly by acting as {Glossary.*Cloud_condensation_nuclei cloud condensation nuclei} or ice nuclei, modifying the optical properties and {Glossary.*Lifetime lifetime} of clouds (see {Glossary.*Aerosol_cloud_interaction Aerosol–cloud interaction}).

The aerosol perturbation can be {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} or come from some natural {Glossary.*Source source}. The {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} from such interactions has traditionally been {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} to numerous indirect aerosol effects, but in this report, only two levels of radiative forcing (or effect) are distinguished:

      | The radiative forcing (or radiative effect, if the perturbation is internally generated) due to the change in number or size distribution of cloud droplets or ice crystals that is the proximate result of an aerosol perturbation, with other variables (in particular total cloud water content) remaining equal. In liquid clouds, an increase in cloud droplet concentration and surface area would increase the cloud albedo. This effect is also known as the cloud albedo effect, first indirect effect, or Twomey effect. It is a largely theoretical concept that cannot readily be isolated in observations or comprehensive process models due to the rapidity and ubiquity of rapid adjustments.

      | A {Glossary.*Bayesian_method_approach Bayesian method} is a method by which a statistical analysis of an unknown or uncertain quantity(ies) is carried out in two steps. First, a prior probability distribution for the uncertain quantity(ies) is formulated on the basis of existing knowledge (either by eliciting expert opinion or by using existing data and studies). At this first stage, an element of subjectivity may influence the choice, but in many cases, the prior probability distribution can be chosen as neutrally as possible, in order not to influence the final outcome of the analysis. In the second step, newly acquired data are used to update the prior distribution into a posterior distribution. The update is carried out either through an analytic computation or though numeric approximation, using a theorem formulated by and named after the British mathematician Thomas Bayes (1702–1761).

      | Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing external forcings} such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent {Glossary.*Anthropogenic anthropogenic} changes in the composition of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} or in land use. Note that the {Glossary.*Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change Framework Convention on Climate Change} ({Glossary.*United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change UNFCCC}), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is {Topics.*Attribution_of_Change attributed} directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere} and which is in addition to natural {Topics.*Climate_Variability climate variability} observed over comparable time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to {Topics.*Human_Influence human activities} altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

The further change in temperature after the composition of the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} is held constant is referred to as the constant composition temperature commitment or simply committed warming or warming commitment. {Glossary.*Climate_change_commitment Climate change commitment} includes other future changes, for example, in the {Glossary.*Hydrological_cycle hydrological cycle}, in extreme weather events, in {Topics.*Extreme_Events extreme climate events}, and in {Topics.*Sea_Level sea level change}.

This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a globalscale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the {Glossary.*Southern_Oscillation Southern Oscillation}. This coupled {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}–ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation ({Glossary.*El_Nin_o_Southern_Oscillation ENSO}). It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin or the sea {Topics.*Surface_Temperature surface temperatures} in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds.

      | An equilibrium climate experiment is a {Topics.*Climate_Modelling climate model} experiment in which the model is allowed to fully adjust to a change in {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing}. Such experiments provide information on the difference between the initial and final states of the model, but not on the time-dependent response. If the forcing is allowed to evolve gradually according to a prescribed {Topics.*Emissions emission} scenario, the time-dependent response of a climate model may be analysed. Such an experiment is called a transient climate experiment.

      | {Glossary.*Geoengineering Geoengineering} refers to a broad set of methods and technologies that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order to alleviate the impacts of climate change. Most, but not all, methods seek to either (1) reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system ({Glossary.*Solar_Radiation_Management Solar Radiation Management}) or (2) increase net carbon sinks from the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} at a scale sufficiently large to alter climate ({Glossary.*Carbon_Dioxide_Removal Carbon Dioxide Removal}). Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key characteristics of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that they use or affect the climate system (e.g., {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}, land or ocean) globally or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects that cross national boundaries. Geoengineering is different from weather modification and ecological engineering, but the boundary can be fuzzy ({cite.Glossary.'IPCC_2012}, p. 2).

      | Adjustment time or response time (Ta) is the time scale characterizing the decay of an instantaneous pulse input into the reservoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterize the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in the source strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to quantify a first-order exponential decay process. See {Glossary.*Response_time Response time} for a different definition pertinent to climate variations.
      | The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a surrogate for adjustment time.
      | In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, the adjustment time equals the turnover time: T = Ta. An example is CFC-11, which is removed from the atmosphere only by photochemical processes in the stratosphere. In more complicated cases, where several reservoirs are involved or where the removal is not proportional to the total mass, the equality T = Ta no longer holds. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an extreme example. Its turnover time is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large part of that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere within a few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approximate value of 100 years may be given for the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment is faster initially and slower later on. In the case of methane (CH4), the adjustment time is different from the turnover time because the removal is mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH), the concentration of which itself depends on the CH4 concentration. Therefore, the CH4 removal rate S is not proportional to its total mass M.

      | Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux (expressed in W m–2) at the {Glossary.*Tropopause tropopause} or top of {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere} due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as, for example, a change in the concentration of {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide carbon dioxide} or the output of the Sun. Sometimes internal drivers are still treated as forcings even though they result from the alteration in climate, for example {Glossary.*Aerosol aerosol} or {Glossary.*Greenhouse_gas greenhouse gas} changes in paleoclimates. The traditional {Topics.*Radiative_Forcing radiative forcing} is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the {Glossary.*Effective_radiative_forcing effective radiative forcing}. For the purposes of this report, radiative forcing is further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, which describes an unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the {Glossary.*Atmosphere atmosphere}.

For example, {Glossary.*Carbon_dioxide carbon dioxide} and aerosols, by altering internal heating and cooling rates within the {Topics.*Climate_System atmosphere}, can each cause changes to cloud cover and other variables thereby producing a {Glossary.*Radiative_effect radiative effect} even in the absence of any surface warming or cooling. Adjustments are rapid in the sense that they begin to occur right away, before climate feedbacks which are driven by warming (although some adjustments may still take significant time to proceed to completion, for example those involving vegetation or ice sheets). It is also called the rapid response or fast adjustment. For further explanation on the concept, see Sections {Chapters.7.7_1 7.1} and {Chapters.8.8_1 8.1}.
