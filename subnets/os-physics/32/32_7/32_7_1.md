  * There are two types of nuclear weaponsâ€”fission bombs use fission alone, whereas thermonuclear bombs use fission to ignite fusion.
  * Both types of weapons produce huge numbers of nuclear reactions in a very short time.
  * Energy yields are measured in kilotons or megatons of equivalent conventional explosives and range from 0.1 kT to more than 20 MT.
  * Nuclear bombs are characterized by far more thermal output and nuclear radiation output than conventional explosives.
