  *  lists certain diagnostic uses of radiopharmaceuticals including the isotope and activity typically used in diagnostics.
  * One common imaging device is the Anger camera, which consists of a lead collimator, radiation detectors, and an analysis computer.
  * Tomography performed with  **γ size 12&#123;γ&#125; &#123;&#125;**-emitting radiopharmaceuticals is called SPECT and has the advantages of x-ray CT scans coupled with organ- and function-specific drugs.
  * PET is a similar technique that uses  **β+ size 12&#123;β rSup &#123; size 8&#123;+&#123;&#125;&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;** emitters and detects the two annihilation  **γ size 12&#123;γ&#125; &#123;&#125;** rays, which aid to localize the source.
