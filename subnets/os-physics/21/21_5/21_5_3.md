  * Null measurement techniques achieve greater accuracy by balancing a circuit so that no current flows through the measuring device.
  * One such device, for determining voltage, is a potentiometer.
  * Another null measurement device, for determining resistance, is the Wheatstone bridge.
  * Other physical quantities can also be measured with null measurement techniques.
