  * Kirchhoff’s rules can be used to analyze any circuit, simple or complex.
  * Kirchhoff’s first rule—the junction rule: The sum of all currents entering a junction must equal the sum of all currents leaving the junction.
  * Kirchhoff’s second rule—the loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed circuit path (loop) must be zero.
  * The two rules are based, respectively, on the laws of conservation of charge and energy.
  * When calculating potential and current using Kirchhoff’s rules, a set of conventions must be followed for determining the correct signs of various terms.
  * The simpler series and parallel rules are special cases of Kirchhoff’s rules.
