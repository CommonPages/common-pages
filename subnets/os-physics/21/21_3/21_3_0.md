name: Kirchhoff’s Rules - Introduction

Many complex circuits, such as the one in {'Figure_22_3_1 Figure 22.3.1}, cannot be analyzed with the series-parallel techniques developed in <link:> and <link:>. There are, however, two circuit analysis rules that can be used to analyze any circuit, simple or complex. These rules are special cases of the laws of conservation of charge and conservation of energy. The rules are known as  **Kirchhoff’s rules**, after their inventor Gustav Kirchhoff (1824–1887).

Explanations of the two rules will now be given, followed by problem-solving hints for applying Kirchhoff’s rules, and a worked example that uses them.
