name: Resistors in Series and Parallel - Introduction

Most circuits have more than one component, called a  **resistor** that limits the flow of charge in the circuit. A measure of this limit on charge flow is called  **resistance**. The simplest combinations of resistors are the series and parallel connections illustrated in {'Figure_22_1_1 Figure 22.1.1}. The total resistance of a combination of resistors depends on both their individual values and how they are connected.
