  * Voltmeters measure voltage, and ammeters measure current.
  * A voltmeter is placed in parallel with the voltage source to receive full voltage and must have a large resistance to limit its effect on the circuit.
  * An ammeter is placed in series to get the full current flowing through a branch and must have a small resistance to limit its effect on the circuit.
  * Both can be based on the combination of a resistor and a galvanometer, a device that gives an analog reading of current.
  * Standard voltmeters and ammeters alter the circuit being measured and are thus limited in accuracy.
