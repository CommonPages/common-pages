name: Sign and Direction

Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the signs of the answers. In our chosen coordinate system, plus means the quantity is to the right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy to imagine for displacement and velocity. But it is a little less obvious for acceleration. Most people interpret negative acceleration as the slowing of an object. This was not the case in , where a positive acceleration slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity. In fact, a negative acceleration will  *increase* a negative velocity. For example, the train moving to the left in  is sped up by an acceleration to the left. In that case, both <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;v&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;a&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> are negative. The plus and minus signs give the directions of the accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the object is speeding up. If acceleration has the opposite sign as the velocity, the object is slowing down.
