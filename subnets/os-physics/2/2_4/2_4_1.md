name: Instantaneous Acceleration

 **Instantaneous acceleration**<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow></semantics></math>, or the  *acceleration at a specific instant in time*, is obtained by the same process as discussed for instantaneous velocity in <link:>—that is, by considering an infinitesimally small interval of time. How do we find instantaneous acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average acceleration that is representative of the motion. {'Figure_2_3_2 Figure 2.3.2} shows graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two very different motions. In {'Figure_2_3_2 Figure 2.3.2}(a), the acceleration varies slightly and the average over the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In this case, we should treat this motion as if it had a constant acceleration equal to the average (in this case about <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mtext>.</mtext><mn>8 m</mn><mi/><msup><mtext>/s</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow></semantics></math>). In {'Figure_2_3_2 Figure 2.3.2}(b), the acceleration varies drastically over time. In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and choose an average acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with accelerations of <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mtext>.</mtext><mn>0 m</mn><msup><mtext>/s</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math> and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>–2</mtext><mtext>.</mtext><mn>0 m</mn><msup><mtext>/s</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow></semantics></math>, respectively.

The next several examples consider the motion of the subway train shown in {'Figure_2_3_3 Figure 2.3.3}. In (a) the shuttle moves to the right, and in (b) it moves to the left. The examples are designed to further illustrate aspects of motion and to illustrate some of the reasoning that goes into solving problems.

The graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration vs. time for the trains in  and  are displayed in {'Figure_2_3_4 Figure 2.3.4}. (We have taken the velocity to remain constant from 20 to 40 s, after which the train decelerates.)
