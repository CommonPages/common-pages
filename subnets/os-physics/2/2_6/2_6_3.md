  *  *The six basic problem solving steps for physics are:*      Step 1. Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved.      Step 2. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).      Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).      Step 4. Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem.      Step 5. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units.      Step 6. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?
