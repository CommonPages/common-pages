name: Distance

Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not.  **Distance** is defined to be  *the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions*. Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them.  **Distance traveled** is  *the total length of the path traveled between two positions*. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is 2.0 m. The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 m.
