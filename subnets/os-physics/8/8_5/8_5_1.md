  * An inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved).
  * A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called perfectly inelastic because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other type of inelastic collision.
  * Sports science and technologies also use physics concepts such as momentum and rotational motion and vibrations.
