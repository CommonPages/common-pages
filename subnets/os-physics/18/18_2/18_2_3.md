  * Polarization is the separation of positive and negative charges in a neutral object.
  * A conductor is a substance that allows charge to flow freely through its atomic structure.
  * An insulator holds charge within its atomic structure.
  * Objects with like charges repel each other, while those with unlike charges attract each other.
  * A conducting object is said to be grounded if it is connected to the Earth through a conductor. Grounding allows transfer of charge to and from the earthâ€™s large reservoir.
  * Objects can be charged by contact with another charged object and obtain the same sign charge.
  * If an object is temporarily grounded, it can be charged by induction, and obtains the opposite sign charge.
  * Polarized objects have their positive and negative charges concentrated in different areas, giving them a non-symmetrical charge.
  * Polar molecules have an inherent separation of charge.
