  * Drawings of electric field lines are useful visual tools. The properties of electric field lines for any charge distribution are that:
  * Field lines must begin on positive charges and terminate on negative charges, or at infinity in the hypothetical case of isolated charges.
  * The number of field lines leaving a positive charge or entering a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
  * The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness of the field linesâ€”more precisely, it is proportional to the number of lines per unit area perpendicular to the lines.
  * The direction of the electric field is tangent to the field line at any point in space.
  * Field lines can never cross.
