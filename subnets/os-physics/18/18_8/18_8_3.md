name: Laser Printers

 **Laser printers** use the xerographic process to make high-quality images on paper, employing a laser to produce an image on the photoconducting drum as shown in {'Figure_19_8_4a Figure 19.8.4a}. In its most common application, the laser printer receives output from a computer, and it can achieve high-quality output because of the precision with which laser light can be controlled. Many laser printers do significant information processing, such as making sophisticated letters or fonts, and may contain a computer more powerful than the one giving them the raw data to be printed.
