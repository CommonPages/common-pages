  * Many molecules in living organisms, such as DNA, carry a charge.
  * An uneven distribution of the positive and negative charges within a polar molecule produces a dipole.
  * The effect of a Coulomb field generated by a charged object may be reduced or blocked by other nearby charged objects.
  * Biological systems contain water, and because water molecules are polar, they have a strong effect on other molecules in living systems.
