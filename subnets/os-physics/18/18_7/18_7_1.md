name: Earth’s Electric Field

A near uniform electric field of approximately 150 N/C, directed downward, surrounds Earth, with the magnitude increasing slightly as we get closer to the surface. What causes the electric field? At around 100 km above the surface of Earth we have a layer of charged particles, called the  **ionosphere**. The ionosphere is responsible for a range of phenomena including the electric field surrounding Earth. In fair weather the ionosphere is positive and the Earth largely negative, maintaining the electric field ({'Figure_19_7_6a Figure 19.7.6a}(a)).

In storm conditions clouds form and localized electric fields can be larger and reversed in direction ({'Figure_19_7_6a Figure 19.7.6a}(b)). The exact charge distributions depend on the local conditions, and variations of {'Figure_19_7_6a Figure 19.7.6a}(b) are possible.

If the electric field is sufficiently large, the insulating properties of the surrounding material break down and it becomes conducting. For air this occurs at around <math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo stretchy="false">×</mo><msup><mtext>10</mtext><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;3 times &quot;10&quot; rSup &#123; size 8&#123;6&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> N/C. Air ionizes ions and electrons recombine, and we get discharge in the form of lightning sparks and corona discharge.
