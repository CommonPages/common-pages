  * A conductor allows free charges to move about within it.
  * The electrical forces around a conductor will cause free charges to move around inside the conductor until static equilibrium is reached.
  * Any excess charge will collect along the surface of a conductor.
  * Conductors with sharp corners or points will collect more charge at those points.
  * A lightning rod is a conductor with sharply pointed ends that collect excess charge on the building caused by an electrical storm and allow it to dissipate back into the air.
  * Electrical storms result when the electrical field of Earthâ€™s surface in certain locations becomes more strongly charged, due to changes in the insulating effect of the air.
  * A Faraday cage acts like a shield around an object, preventing electric charge from penetrating inside.
