name: Separation of Charge in Atoms

Charges in atoms and molecules can be separated—for example, by rubbing materials together. Some atoms and molecules have a greater affinity for electrons than others and will become negatively charged by close contact in rubbing, leaving the other material positively charged. (See {'Figure_19_1_6a Figure 19.1.6a}.) Positive charge can similarly be induced by rubbing. Methods other than rubbing can also separate charges. Batteries, for example, use combinations of substances that interact in such a way as to separate charges. Chemical interactions may transfer negative charge from one substance to the other, making one battery terminal negative and leaving the first one positive.

No charge is actually created or destroyed when charges are separated as we have been discussing. Rather, existing charges are moved about. In fact, in all situations the total amount of charge is always constant. This universally obeyed law of nature is called the  **law of conservation of charge**.

In more exotic situations, such as in particle accelerators, mass, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>Δ</mn><mi fontstyle="italic">m</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;Δm&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>, can be created from energy in the amount

Sometimes, the created mass is charged, such as when an electron is created. Whenever a charged particle is created, another having an opposite charge is always created along with it, so that the total charge created is zero. Usually, the two particles are “matter-antimatter” counterparts. For example, an antielectron would usually be created at the same time as an electron. The antielectron has a positive charge (it is called a positron), and so the total charge created is zero. (See {'Figure_19_1_7a Figure 19.1.7a}.) All particles have antimatter counterparts with opposite signs. When matter and antimatter counterparts are brought together, they completely annihilate one another. By annihilate, we mean that the mass of the two particles is converted to energy  *E*, again obeying the relationship <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>Δ</mn><mi fontstyle="italic">m</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mfrac><mi>E</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;Δm= &#123;  &#123;E&#125;  over  &#123;c rSup &#123; size 8&#123;2&#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>. Since the two particles have equal and opposite charge, the total charge is zero before and after the annihilation; thus, total charge is conserved.

The law of conservation of charge is absolute—it has never been observed to be violated. Charge, then, is a special physical quantity, joining a very short list of other quantities in nature that are always conserved. Other conserved quantities include energy, momentum, and angular momentum.
