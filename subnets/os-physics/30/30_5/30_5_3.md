  * An important atomic process is fluorescence, defined to be any process in which an atom or molecule is excited by absorbing a photon of a given energy and de-excited by emitting a photon of a lower energy.
  * Some states live much longer than others and are termed metastable.
  * Phosphorescence is the de-excitation of a metastable state.
  * Lasers produce coherent single-wavelength EM radiation by stimulated emission, in which a metastable state is stimulated to decay.
  * Lasing requires a population inversion, in which a majority of the atoms or molecules are in their metastable state.
