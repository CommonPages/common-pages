  * An equipotential line is a line along which the electric potential is constant.
  * An equipotential surface is a three-dimensional version of equipotential lines.
  * Equipotential lines are always perpendicular to electric field lines.
  * The process by which a conductor can be fixed at zero volts by connecting it to the earth with a good conductor is called grounding.
