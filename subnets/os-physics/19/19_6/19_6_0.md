name: Capacitors in Series and Parallel - Introduction

Several capacitors may be connected together in a variety of applications. Multiple connections of capacitors act like a single equivalent capacitor. The total capacitance of this equivalent single capacitor depends both on the individual capacitors and how they are connected. There are two simple and common types of connections, called  *series* and  *parallel*, for which we can easily calculate the total capacitance. Certain more complicated connections can also be related to combinations of series and parallel.
