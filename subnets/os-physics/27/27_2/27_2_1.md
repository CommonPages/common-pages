  * An accurate technique for determining how and where waves propagate is given by Huygensâ€™s principle: Every point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets.
  * Diffraction is the bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or other obstacle.
