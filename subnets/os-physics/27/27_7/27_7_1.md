name: Problem-Solving Strategies for Wave Optics

 *Step 1.* *Examine the situation to determine that interference is involved*. Identify whether slits or thin film interference are considered in the problem.

 *Step 2.* *If slits are involved*, note that diffraction gratings and double slits produce very similar interference patterns, but that gratings have narrower (sharper) maxima. Single slit patterns are characterized by a large central maximum and smaller maxima to the sides.

 *Step 3.* *If thin film interference is involved, take note of the path length difference between the two rays that interfere*. Be certain to use the wavelength in the medium involved, since it differs from the wavelength in vacuum. Note also that there is an additional <math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;λ/2&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> phase shift when light reflects from a medium with a greater index of refraction.

 *Step 4.* *Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns)*. A written list is useful. Draw a diagram of the situation. Labeling the diagram is useful.

 *Step 5.* *Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns)*.

 *Step 6.* *Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown), and enter the knowns*. Slits, gratings, and the Rayleigh limit involve equations.

 *Step 7.* *For thin film interference, you will have constructive interference for a total shift that is an integral number of wavelengths. You will have destructive interference for a total shift of a half-integral number of wavelengths*. Always keep in mind that crest to crest is constructive whereas crest to trough is destructive.

 *Step 8.* *Check to see if the answer is reasonable: Does it make sense?* Angles in interference patterns cannot be greater than <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>90º</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;&quot;90&quot;°&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>, for example.
