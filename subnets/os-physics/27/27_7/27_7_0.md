name: Thin Film Interference - Introduction

The bright colors seen in an oil slick floating on water or in a sunlit soap bubble are caused by interference. The brightest colors are those that interfere constructively. This interference is between light reflected from different surfaces of a thin film; thus, the effect is known as  **thin film interference**. As noticed before, interference effects are most prominent when light interacts with something having a size similar to its wavelength. A thin film is one having a thickness <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;t&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> smaller than a few times the wavelength of light, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;λ&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>.

What causes thin film interference? {'Figure_28_7_1a Figure 28.7.1a} shows how light reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of a film can interfere. Incident light is only partially reflected from the top surface of the film (ray 1). The remainder enters the film and is itself partially reflected from the bottom surface. Part of the light reflected from the bottom surface can emerge from the top of the film (ray 2) and interfere with light reflected from the top (ray 1). Since the ray that enters the film travels a greater distance, it may be in or out of phase with the ray reflected from the top. However, consider for a moment, again, the bubbles in {'Figure_28_0_2a Figure 28.0.2a}. The bubbles are darkest where they are thinnest. Furthermore, if you observe a soap bubble carefully, you will note it gets dark at the point where it breaks. For very thin films, the difference in path lengths of ray 1 and ray 2 in {'Figure_28_7_1a Figure 28.7.1a} is negligible; so why should they interfere destructively and not constructively? The answer is that a phase change can occur upon reflection. The rule is as follows:

 *When light reflects from a medium having an index of refraction greater than that of the medium in which it is traveling, a

     shift) occurs.*

If the film in {'Figure_28_7_1a Figure 28.7.1a} is a soap bubble (essentially water with air on both sides), then there is a <math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;λ/2&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> shift for ray 1 and none for ray 2. Thus, when the film is very thin, the path length difference between the two rays is negligible, they are exactly out of phase, and destructive interference will occur at all wavelengths and so the soap bubble will be dark here.

The thickness of the film relative to the wavelength of light is the other crucial factor in thin film interference. Ray 2 in {'Figure_28_7_1a Figure 28.7.1a} travels a greater distance than ray 1. For light incident perpendicular to the surface, ray 2 travels a distance approximately <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;2t&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> farther than ray 1.

Thin film interference is most constructive or most destructive when the path length difference for the two rays is an integral or half-integral wavelength, respectively. That is, for rays incident perpendicularly, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mi>,</mi><mspace width="0.25em"/><msub><mn>2λ</mn><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mi>,</mi><mspace width="0.25em"/><msub><mn>3λ</mn><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mi>,</mi><mo stretchy="false">…</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow></semantics></math> or <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mn>2,</mn></mrow></mrow><mspace width="0.25em"/><mrow><msub><mn>3λ</mn><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mn>2,</mn></mrow><mspace width="0.25em"/><mrow><msub><mn>5λ</mn><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mn>2,</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">…</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow></semantics></math>. To know whether interference is constructive or destructive, you must also determine if there is a phase change upon reflection. Thin film interference thus depends on film thickness, the wavelength of light, and the refractive indices. For white light incident on a film that varies in thickness, you will observe rainbow colors of constructive interference for various wavelengths as the thickness varies.

Another example of thin film interference can be seen when microscope slides are separated (see {'Figure_28_7_2a Figure 28.7.2a}). The slides are very flat, so that the wedge of air between them increases in thickness very uniformly. A phase change occurs at the second surface but not the first, and so there is a dark band where the slides touch. The rainbow colors of constructive interference repeat, going from violet to red again and again as the distance between the slides increases. As the layer of air increases, the bands become more difficult to see, because slight changes in incident angle have greater effects on path length differences. If pure-wavelength light instead of white light is used, then bright and dark bands are obtained rather than repeating rainbow colors.

An important application of thin film interference is found in the manufacturing of optical instruments. A lens or mirror can be compared with a master as it is being ground, allowing it to be shaped to an accuracy of less than a wavelength over its entire surface. {'Figure_28_7_3a Figure 28.7.3a} illustrates the phenomenon called Newton’s rings, which occurs when the plane surfaces of two lenses are placed together. (The circular bands are called Newton’s rings because Isaac Newton described them and their use in detail. Newton did not discover them; Robert Hooke did, and Newton did not believe they were due to the wave character of light.) Each successive ring of a given color indicates an increase of only one wavelength in the distance between the lens and the blank, so that great precision can be obtained. Once the lens is perfect, there will be no rings.

The wings of certain moths and butterflies have nearly iridescent colors due to thin film interference. In addition to pigmentation, the wing’s color is affected greatly by constructive interference of certain wavelengths reflected from its film-coated surface. Car manufacturers are offering special paint jobs that use thin film interference to produce colors that change with angle. This expensive option is based on variation of thin film path length differences with angle. Security features on credit cards, banknotes, driving licenses and similar items prone to forgery use thin film interference, diffraction gratings, or holograms. Australia led the way with dollar bills printed on polymer with a diffraction grating security feature making the currency difficult to forge. Other countries such as New Zealand and Taiwan are using similar technologies, while the United States currency includes a thin film interference effect.
