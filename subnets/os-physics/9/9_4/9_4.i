    Statics can be applied to a variety of situations, ranging from raising a drawbridge to bad posture and back strain. We begin with a discussion of problem-solving strategies specifically used for statics. Since statics is a special case of Newton’s laws, both the general problem-solving strategies and the special strategies for Newton’s laws, discussed in <link:>, still apply.
    
    Now let us apply this problem-solving strategy for the pole vaulter shown in the three figures below. The pole is uniform and has a mass of 5.00 kg. In {'Figure_10_4_1a Figure 10.4.1a}, the pole’s cg lies halfway between the vaulter’s hands. It seems reasonable that the force exerted by each hand is equal to half the weight of the pole, or 24.5 N. This obviously satisfies the first condition for equilibrium <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>(net</mtext><mspace width="0.25em"/><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>0)</mn></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;&quot;net &quot;F=0&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> . The second condition <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>(net</mtext><mspace width="0.25em"/><mrow><msub><mi>τ</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mtext>0)</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow></semantics></math> is also satisfied, as we can see by choosing the cg to be the pivot point. The weight exerts no torque about a pivot point located at the cg, since it is applied at that point and its lever arm is zero. The equal forces exerted by the hands are equidistant from the chosen pivot, and so they exert equal and opposite torques. Similar arguments hold for other systems where supporting forces are exerted symmetrically about the cg. For example, the four legs of a uniform table each support one-fourth of its weight.
    
    In {'Figure_10_4_1a Figure 10.4.1a}, a pole vaulter holding a pole with its cg halfway between his hands is shown. Each hand exerts a force equal to half the weight of the pole, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mrow><mi>w</mi><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;R&#125; &#125; =F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;L&#125; &#125; =w/2&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>. (b) The pole vaulter moves the pole to his left, and the forces that the hands exert are no longer equal. See {'Figure_10_4_1a Figure 10.4.1a}. If the pole is held with its cg to the left of the person, then he must push down with his right hand and up with his left. The forces he exerts are larger here because they are in opposite directions and the cg is at a long distance from either hand.
    
    Similar observations can be made using a meter stick held at different locations along its length.
    
    
            
    
    
            
    
    
            
    
    If the pole vaulter holds the pole as shown in {'Figure_10_4_1b Figure 10.4.1b}, the situation is not as simple. The total force he exerts is still equal to the weight of the pole, but it is not evenly divided between his hands. (If <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;L&#125; &#125; =F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;R&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>, then the torques about the cg would not be equal since the lever arms are different.) Logically, the right hand should support more weight, since it is closer to the cg. In fact, if the right hand is moved directly under the cg, it will support all the weight. This situation is exactly analogous to two people carrying a load; the one closer to the cg carries more of its weight. Finding the forces <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;L&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;R&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> is straightforward, as the next example shows.
    
    If the pole vaulter holds the pole from near the end of the pole ({'Figure_10_4_1c Figure 10.4.1c}), the direction of the force applied by the right hand of the vaulter reverses its direction.
    
    If the pole vaulter holds the pole as he might at the start of a run, shown in {'Figure_10_4_1c Figure 10.4.1c}, the forces change again. Both are considerably greater, and one force reverses direction.
