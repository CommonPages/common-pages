  * To solve problems involving Newton’s laws of motion, follow the procedure described:Draw a sketch of the problem.       Identify known and unknown quantities, and identify the system of interest. Draw a free-body diagram, which is a sketch showing all of the forces acting on an object. The object is represented by a dot, and the forces are represented by vectors extending in different directions from the dot. If vectors act in directions that are not horizontal or vertical, resolve the vectors into horizontal and vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram.       Write Newton’s second law in the horizontal and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the object does not accelerate in a particular direction (for example, the x size 12&#123;x&#125; &#123;&#125;-direction) then Fnetx=0 size 12&#123;F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;"net x"&#125; &#125; =0&#125; &#123;&#125;. If the object does accelerate in that direction, Fnet x=ma size 12&#123;F rSub &#123; size 8&#123;"net x"&#125; &#125; = ital "ma"&#125; &#123;&#125;.       Check your answer. Is the answer reasonable? Are the units correct?
