The basics of problem solving, presented earlier in this text, are followed here, but specific strategies useful in applying Newtonâ€™s laws of motion are emphasized. These techniques also reinforce concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many problem-solving strategies are stated outright in the worked examples, and so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already begun to develop.
