name: Newton’s Second Law of Motion: Concept of a System - Introduction

 **Newton’s second law of motion** is closely related to Newton’s first law of motion. It mathematically states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion. Newton’s second law of motion is more quantitative and is used extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force. Before we can write down Newton’s second law as a simple equation giving the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to sharpen some ideas that have already been mentioned.

First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that there is an  **acceleration**. Newton’s first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion; thus, we see that a  *net external force causes acceleration*.

Another question immediately arises. What do we mean by an external force? An intuitive notion of external is correct—an  **external force** acts from outside the  **system** of interest. For example, in {'Figure04_3_1 Figure04.3.1}(a) the system of interest is the wagon plus the child in it. The two forces exerted by the other children are external forces. An internal force acts between elements of the system. Again looking at {'Figure04_3_1 Figure04.3.1}(a), the force the child in the wagon exerts to hang onto the wagon is an internal force between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect the motion of a system, according to Newton’s first law. (The internal forces actually cancel, as we shall see in the next section.)  *You must define the boundaries of the system before you can determine which forces are external*. Sometimes the system is obvious, whereas other times identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The concept of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is the correct application of Newton’s laws. This concept will be revisited many times on our journey through physics.

Now, it seems reasonable that acceleration should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net (total) external force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified experimentally and is illustrated in {'Figure04_3_1 Figure04.3.1}. In part (a), a smaller force causes a smaller acceleration than the larger force illustrated in part (c). For completeness, the vertical forces are also shown; they are assumed to cancel since there is no acceleration in the vertical direction. The vertical forces are the weight

These will be discussed in more detail in later sections. For now, we will define  **friction** as a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching. {'Figure04_3_1 Figure04.3.1}(b) shows how vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net force,

To obtain an equation for Newton’s second law, we first write the relationship of acceleration and net external force as the proportionality

(The net external force is the vector sum of all external forces and can be determined graphically, using the head-to-tail method, or analytically, using components. The techniques are the same as for the addition of other vectors, and are covered in <link:>.) This proportionality states what we have said in words— *acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force*. Once the system of interest is chosen, it is important to identify the external forces and ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification not to have to consider the numerous internal forces acting between objects within the system, such as muscular forces within the child’s body, let alone the myriad of forces between atoms in the objects, but by doing so, we can easily solve some very complex problems with only minimal error due to our simplification

Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. And indeed, as illustrated in {'Figure04_3_2 Figure04.3.2}, the same net external force applied to a car produces a much smaller acceleration than when applied to a basketball. The proportionality is written as

Experiments have shown that acceleration is exactly inversely proportional to mass, just as it is exactly linearly proportional to the net external force.

It has been found that the acceleration of an object depends  *only* on the net external force and the mass of the object. Combining the two proportionalities just given yields Newton's second law of motion.

Although these last two equations are really the same, the first gives more insight into what Newton’s second law means. The law is a  *cause and effect relationship* among three quantities that is not simply based on their definitions. The validity of the second law is completely based on experimental verification.
