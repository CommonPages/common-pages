  * The various types of forces that are categorized for use in many applications are all manifestations of the  *four basic forces* in nature.
  * The properties of these forces are summarized in .
  * Everything we experience directly without sensitive instruments is due to either electromagnetic forces or gravitational forces. The nuclear forces are responsible for the submicroscopic structure of matter, but they are not directly sensed because of their short ranges. Attempts are being made to show all four forces are different manifestations of a single unified force.
