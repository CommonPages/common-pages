  *  **Newton’s first law of motion** states that a body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. This is also known as the  **law of inertia**.
  *  **Inertia** **** is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion. Inertia is related to an object’s mass.
  *  **Mass** is the quantity of matter in a substance.
