name: Integrating Concepts: Newton’s Laws of Motion and Kinematics 

Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general situations that involve more than a narrow set of physical principles. Newton’s laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion. For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of kinematics, and hence the relevance of earlier chapters. When approaching problems that involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or position, use the following steps to approach the problem:

 *Problem-Solving Strategy*

Step 1.  *Identify which physical principles are involved*. Listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify the principles involved.


Step 2.  *Solve the problem using strategies outlined in the text*. If these are available for the specific topic, you should refer to them. You should also refer to the sections of the text that deal with a particular topic. The following worked example illustrates how these strategies are applied to an integrated concept problem.
