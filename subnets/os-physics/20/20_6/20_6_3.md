  * The two types of electric hazards are thermal (excessive power) and shock (current through a person).
  * Shock severity is determined by current, path, duration, and AC frequency.
  *  lists shock hazards as a function of current.
  * {'Figure_21_6_5a Figure 21.6.5a} graphs the threshold current for two hazards as a function of frequency.
