    There are two known hazards of electricityâ€”thermal and shock. A  **thermal hazard** is one where excessive electric power causes undesired thermal effects, such as starting a fire in the wall of a house. A  **shock hazard** occurs when electric current passes through a person. Shocks range in severity from painful, but otherwise harmless, to heart-stopping lethality. This section considers these hazards and the various factors affecting them in a quantitative manner. <link:> will consider systems and devices for preventing electrical hazards.
