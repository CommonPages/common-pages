  * Electric potentials in neurons and other cells are created by ionic concentration differences across semipermeable membranes.
  * Stimuli change the permeability and create action potentials that propagate along neurons.
  * Myelin sheaths speed this process and reduce the needed energy input.
  * This process in the heart can be measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG).
