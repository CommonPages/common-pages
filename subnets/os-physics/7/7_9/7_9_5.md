  * The relative use of different fuels to provide energy has changed over the years, but fuel use is currently dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing. 
  * Although non-renewable sources dominate, some countries meet a sizeable percentage of their electricity needs from renewable resources.
  * The United States obtains only about 10% of its energy from renewable sources, mostly hydroelectric power.
  * Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita.
  * Even though, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy, energy can never be created or destroyed, energy that can be used to do work is always partly converted to less useful forms, such as waste heat to the environment, in all of our uses of energy for practical purposes.
