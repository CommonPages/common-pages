name: Renewable and Nonrenewable Energy Sources

The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in {'Figure_8_9_1a Figure 8.9.1a}. The fuel mix has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing.  **Renewable forms of energy** are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water, wind, solar, and biomass. About 85% of our energy comes from nonrenewable  **fossil fuels**—oil, natural gas, coal. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use, with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion, has made, in the eyes of many scientists, a shift to non-fossil fuels of utmost importance—but it will not be easy.
