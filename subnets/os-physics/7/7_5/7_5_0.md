name: Nonconservative Forces and Friction

Forces are either conservative or nonconservative. Conservative forces were discussed in <link:>. A  **nonconservative force** is one for which work depends on the path taken. Friction is a good example of a nonconservative force. As illustrated in {'Figure_8_5_1ab1 Figure 8.5.1ab1}, work done against friction depends on the length of the path between the starting and ending points. Because of this dependence on path, there is no potential energy associated with nonconservative forces. An important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force  *adds or removes mechanical energy from a system*.  **Friction**, for example, creates  **thermal energy** that dissipates, removing energy from the system. Furthermore, even if the thermal energy is retained or captured, it cannot be fully converted back to work, so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well.
