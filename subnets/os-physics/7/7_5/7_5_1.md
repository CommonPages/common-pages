name: How Nonconservative Forces Affect Mechanical Energy

 *Mechanical* energy  *may* not be conserved when nonconservative forces act. For example, when a car is brought to a stop by friction on level ground, it loses kinetic energy, which is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing its mechanical energy. {'Figure_8_5_2a Figure 8.5.2a} compares the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces. We often choose to understand simpler systems such as that described in {'Figure_8_5_2a Figure 8.5.2a}(a) first before studying more complicated systems as in {'Figure_8_5_2a Figure 8.5.2a}(b).
