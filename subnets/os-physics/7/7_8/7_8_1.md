name: Power Consumed at Rest

The  *rate* at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the  **metabolic rate**. The total energy conversion rate of a person  *at rest* is called the  **basal metabolic rate** (BMR) and is divided among various systems in the body, as shown in . The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a greater BMR due to this last factor. 


| Organ | Power consumed at rest (W) | Oxygen consumption (mL/min) | Percent of BMR |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Liver & spleen | 23 | 67 | 27 |
| Brain | 16 | 47 | 19 |
| Skeletal muscle | 15 | 45 | 18 |
| Kidney | 9 | 26 | 10 |
| Heart | 6 | 17 | 7 |
| Other | 16 | 48 | 19 |
|  *Totals* | 85 W | 250 mL/min | 100% |
    

Energy consumption is directly proportional to oxygen consumption because the digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food. We can measure the energy people use during various activities by measuring their oxygen use. (See {'Figure_8_8_2a Figure 8.8.2a}.) Approximately 20 kJ of energy are produced for each liter of oxygen consumed, independent of the type of food.  shows energy and oxygen consumption rates (power expended) for a variety of activities.
