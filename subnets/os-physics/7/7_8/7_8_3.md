  * The human body converts energy stored in food into work, thermal energy, and/or chemical energy that is stored in fatty tissue.
  * The  *rate* at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate, and the corresponding rate when at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR)
  * The energy included in the basal metabolic rate is divided among various systems in the body, with the largest fraction going to the liver and spleen, and the brain coming next.
  * About 75% of food calories are used to sustain basic body functions included in the basal metabolic rate.
  * The energy consumption of people during various activities can be determined by measuring their oxygen use, because the digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food.
