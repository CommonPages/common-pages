name: What is Power?

 *Power*â€”the word conjures up many images: a professional football player muscling aside his opponent, a dragster roaring away from the starting line, a volcano blowing its lava into the atmosphere, or a rocket blasting off, as in {'Figure_8_7_1a Figure 8.7.1a}.

These images of power have in common the rapid performance of work, consistent with the scientific definition of  **power** (<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;P&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>) as the rate at which work is done.

Because work is energy transfer, power is also the rate at which energy is expended. A 60-W light bulb, for example, expends 60 J of energy per second. Great power means a large amount of work or energy developed in a short time. For example, when a powerful car accelerates rapidly, it does a large amount of work and consumes a large amount of fuel in a short time.
