name: Calculating Power from Energy

It is impressive that this woman’s useful power output is slightly less than 1  **horsepower**<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mtext>1 hp</mtext><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mtext>746 W</mtext></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123; \( 1&quot; hp&quot;=&quot;746&quot;&quot; W&quot; \) &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>! People can generate more than a horsepower with their leg muscles for short periods of time by rapidly converting available blood sugar and oxygen into work output. (A horse can put out 1 hp for hours on end.) Once oxygen is depleted, power output decreases and the person begins to breathe rapidly to obtain oxygen to metabolize more food—this is known as the  *aerobic* stage of exercise. If the woman climbed the stairs slowly, then her power output would be much less, although the amount of work done would be the same.
