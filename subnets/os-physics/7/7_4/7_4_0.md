name: Potential Energy and Conservative Forces

Work is done by a force, and some forces, such as weight, have special characteristics. A  **conservative force** is one, like the gravitational force, for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken. We can define a  **potential energy**<math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>PE</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123; \( &quot;PE&quot; \) &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> for any conservative force, just as we did for the gravitational force. For example, when you wind up a toy, an egg timer, or an old-fashioned watch, you do work against its spring and store energy in it. (We treat these springs as ideal, in that we assume there is no friction and no production of thermal energy.) This stored energy is recoverable as work, and it is useful to think of it as potential energy contained in the spring. Indeed, the reason that the spring has this characteristic is that its force is  *conservative*. That is, a conservative force results in stored or potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is one example, as is the energy stored in a spring. We will also see how conservative forces are related to the conservation of energy.
