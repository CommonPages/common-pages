name: Electric and Magnetic Waves: Moving Together

Following Ampereâ€™s law, current in the antenna produces a magnetic field, as shown in {'Figure25_2_2a Figure25.2.2a}. The relationship between <math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">E</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;E&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">B</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;B&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> is shown at one instant in {'Figure25_2_2a Figure25.2.2a} (a). As the current varies, the magnetic field varies in magnitude and direction.

The magnetic field lines also propagate away from the antenna at the speed of light, forming the other part of the electromagnetic wave, as seen in {'Figure25_2_2a Figure25.2.2a} (b). The magnetic part of the wave has the same period and wavelength as the electric part, since they are both produced by the same movement and separation of charges in the antenna.

The electric and magnetic waves are shown together at one instant in time in {'Figure25_2_3a Figure25.2.3a}. The electric and magnetic fields produced by a long straight wire antenna are exactly in phase. Note that they are perpendicular to one another and to the direction of propagation, making this a  **transverse wave**.

Electromagnetic waves generally propagate out from a source in all directions, sometimes forming a complex radiation pattern. A linear antenna like this one will not radiate parallel to its length, for example. The wave is shown in one direction from the antenna in {'Figure25_2_3a Figure25.2.3a} to illustrate its basic characteristics.

Instead of the AC generator, the antenna can also be driven by an AC circuit. In fact, charges radiate whenever they are accelerated. But while a current in a circuit needs a complete path, an antenna has a varying charge distribution forming a  **standing wave**, driven by the AC. The dimensions of the antenna are critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves. This is a  **resonant** phenomenon and when we tune radios or TV, we vary electrical properties to achieve appropriate resonant conditions in the antenna.
