  * Electrical safety systems and devices are employed to prevent thermal and shock hazards.
  * Circuit breakers and fuses interrupt excessive currents to prevent thermal hazards.
  * The three-wire system guards against thermal and shock hazards, utilizing live/hot, neutral, and earth/ground wires, and grounding the neutral wire and case of the appliance.
  * A ground fault interrupter (GFI) prevents shock by detecting the loss of current to unintentional paths.
  * An isolation transformer insulates the device being powered from the original source, also to prevent shock.
  * Many of these devices use induction to perform their basic function.
