name: Resistors in an AC Circuit

Just as a reminder, consider {'Figure_24_11_3a Figure 24.11.3a}, which shows an AC voltage applied to a resistor and a graph of voltage and current versus time. The voltage and current are exactly  *in* *phase* in a resistor. There is no frequency dependence to the behavior of plain resistance in a circuit:
