  * Magnetic poles always occur in pairs of north and south—it is not possible to isolate north and south poles. 
  * All magnetism is created by electric current.
  * Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, are those that exhibit strong magnetic effects. 
  * The atoms in ferromagnetic materials act like small magnets (due to currents within the atoms) and can be aligned, usually in millimeter-sized regions called domains. 
  * Domains can grow and align on a larger scale, producing permanent magnets. Such a material is magnetized, or induced to be magnetic. 
  * Above a material’s Curie temperature, thermal agitation destroys the alignment of atoms, and ferromagnetism disappears. 
  * Electromagnets employ electric currents to make magnetic fields, often aided by induced fields in ferromagnetic materials.
