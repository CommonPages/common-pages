name: Magnetic Field Strength: Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field - Introduction

What is the mechanism by which one magnet exerts a force on another? The answer is related to the fact that all magnetism is caused by current, the flow of charge.  *Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges*, and so they exert forces on other magnets, all of which have moving charges.
