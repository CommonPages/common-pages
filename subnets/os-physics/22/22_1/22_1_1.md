  * Magnetism is a subject that includes the properties of magnets, the effect of the magnetic force on moving charges and currents, and the creation of magnetic fields by currents.
  * There are two types of magnetic poles, called the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.
  * North magnetic poles are those that are attracted toward the Earth’s geographic north pole.
  * Like poles repel and unlike poles attract.
  * Magnetic poles always occur in pairs of north and south—it is not possible to isolate north and south poles.
