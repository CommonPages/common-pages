  * The Carnot cycle is a theoretical cycle that is the most efficient cyclical process possible. Any engine using the Carnot cycle, which uses only reversible processes (adiabatic and isothermal), is known as a Carnot engine.
  * Any engine that uses the Carnot cycle enjoys the maximum theoretical efficiency.
  * While Carnot engines are ideal engines, in reality, no engine achieves Carnotâ€™s theoretical maximum efficiency, since dissipative processes, such as friction, play a role. Carnot cycles without heat loss may be possible at absolute zero, but this has never been seen in nature.
