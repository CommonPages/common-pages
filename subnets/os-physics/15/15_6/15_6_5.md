  * Entropy is the loss of energy available to do work.
  * Another form of the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant; it never decreases.
  * Entropy is zero in a reversible process; it increases in an irreversible process.
  * The ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be thermodynamic equilibrium, where the universal temperature is constant and no energy is available to do work.
  * Entropy is also associated with the tendency toward disorder in a closed system.
