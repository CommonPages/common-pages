  * Most substances have three distinct phases: gas, liquid, and solid. 
  * Phase changes among the various phases of matter depend on temperature and pressure. 
  * The existence of the three phases with respect to pressure and temperature can be described in a phase diagram.
  * Two phases coexist (i.e., they are in thermal equilibrium) at a set of pressures and temperatures. These are described as a line on a phase diagram.
  * The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram.
  * A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor. 
  * Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. 
  * Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone. 
  * Daltonâ€™s law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all of the gases present.
