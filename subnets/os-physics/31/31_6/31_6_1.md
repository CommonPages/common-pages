## For Reaction And Binding Energies and Activity Calculations in Nuclear Physics

  1.    *Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns)*. This will allow you to decide whether the energy of a decay or nuclear reaction is involved, for example, or whether the problem is primarily concerned with activity (rate of decay).
  2.  *Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).*
  3.  *For reaction and binding-energy problems, we use atomic rather than nuclear masses.*Since the masses of neutral atoms are used, you must count the number of electrons involved. If these do not balance (such as in <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>β</mi><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><mrow/></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;β rSup &#123; size 8&#123;+&#123;&#125;&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> decay), then an energy adjustment of 0.511 MeV per electron must be made. Also note that atomic masses may not be given in a problem; they can be found in tables.
  4.  *For problems involving activity, the relationship of activity to half-life, and the number of nuclei given in the equation R=0.693Nt1/2 size 12&#123;R= &#123;  &#123;1 "." "693"N&#125;  over  &#123;t rSub &#123; size 8&#123;1/2&#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125; can be very useful.* Owing to the fact that number of nuclei is involved, you will also need to be familiar with moles and Avogadro’s number.
  5.  *Perform the desired calculation; keep careful track of plus and minus signs as well as powers of 10.*
  6.  *Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?* Compare your results with worked examples and other information in the text. (Heeding the advice in Step 5 will also help you to be certain of your result.) You must understand the problem conceptually to be able to determine whether the numerical result is reasonable.
