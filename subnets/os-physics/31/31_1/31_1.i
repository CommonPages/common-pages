    The discovery and study of nuclear radioactivity quickly revealed evidence of revolutionary new physics. In addition, uses for nuclear radiation also emerged quicklyâ€”for example, people such as Ernest Rutherford used it to determine the size of the nucleus and devices were painted with radon-doped paint to make them glow in the dark (see {'Figure_32_1_1a Figure 32.1.1a}). We therefore begin our study of nuclear physics with the discovery and basic features of nuclear radioactivity.
