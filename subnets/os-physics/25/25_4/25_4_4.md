  * The incident angle that produces an angle of refraction of <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>90º</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;&quot;90&quot;°&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> is called critical angle.
  * Total internal reflection is a phenomenon that occurs at the boundary between two mediums, such that if the incident angle in the first medium is greater than the critical angle, then all the light is reflected back into that medium.
  * Fiber optics involves the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass, applying the principle of total internal reflection.
  * Endoscopes are used to explore the body through various orifices or minor incisions, based on the transmission of light through optical fibers.
  * Cladding prevents light from being transmitted between fibers in a bundle.
  * Diamonds sparkle due to total internal reflection coupled with a large index of refraction.
