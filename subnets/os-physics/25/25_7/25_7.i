/ Image Formation by Mirrors
story 25_7
  >
    We only have to look as far as the nearest bathroom to find an example of an image formed by a mirror. Images in flat mirrors are the same size as the object and are located behind the mirror. Like lenses, mirrors can form a variety of images. For example, dental mirrors may produce a magnified image, just as makeup mirrors do. Security mirrors in shops, on the other hand, form images that are smaller than the object. We will use the law of reflection to understand how mirrors form images, and we will find that mirror images are analogous to those formed by lenses.
    
    {'Figure26_7_1 Figure26.7.1} helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the mirror, and being reflected into the observer’s eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still get into the eye. If the rays are extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, locating the image. (The paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror.) Using the law of reflection—the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence—we can see that the image and object are the same distance from the mirror. This is a virtual image, since it cannot be projected—the rays only appear to originate from a common point behind the mirror. Obviously, if you walk behind the mirror, you cannot see the image, since the rays do not go there. But in front of the mirror, the rays behave exactly as if they had come from behind the mirror, so that is where the image is situated.
    
    
            
    
    Now let us consider the focal length of a mirror—for example, the concave spherical mirrors in {'Figure26_7_2 Figure26.7.2}. Rays of light that strike the surface follow the law of reflection. For a mirror that is large compared with its radius of curvature, as in {'Figure26_7_2 Figure26.7.2}(a), we see that the reflected rays do not cross at the same point, and the mirror does not have a well-defined focal point. If the mirror had the shape of a parabola, the rays would all cross at a single point, and the mirror would have a well-defined focal point. But parabolic mirrors are much more expensive to make than spherical mirrors. The solution is to use a mirror that is small compared with its radius of curvature, as shown in {'Figure26_7_2 Figure26.7.2}(b). (This is the mirror equivalent of the thin lens approximation.) To a very good approximation, this mirror has a well-defined focal point at F that is the focal distance <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;f&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> from the center of the mirror. The focal length <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;f&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> of a concave mirror is positive, since it is a converging mirror.
    
    
            
    
    Just as for lenses, the shorter the focal length, the more powerful the mirror; thus, <math xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">/</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;P=1/f&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> for a mirror, too. A more strongly curved mirror has a shorter focal length and a greater power. Using the law of reflection and some simple trigonometry, it can be shown that the focal length is half the radius of curvature, or

    where <math xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;R&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> is the radius of curvature of a spherical mirror. The smaller the radius of curvature, the smaller the focal length and, thus, the more powerful the mirror.
    
    The convex mirror shown in {'Figure26_7_3 Figure26.7.3} also has a focal point. Parallel rays of light reflected from the mirror seem to originate from the point F at the focal distance <math xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;f&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> behind the mirror. The focal length and power of a convex mirror are negative, since it is a diverging mirror.
    
    
            
    
    Ray tracing is as useful for mirrors as for lenses. The rules for ray tracing for mirrors are based on the illustrations just discussed:
    
      1. A ray approaching a concave converging mirror parallel to its axis is reflected through the focal point F of the mirror on the same side. (See rays 1 and 3 in {'Figure26_7_2 Figure26.7.2}(b).)
      2. A ray approaching a convex diverging mirror parallel to its axis is reflected so that it seems to come from the focal point F behind the mirror. (See rays 1 and 3 in {'Figure26_7_3 Figure26.7.3}.)
      3. Any ray striking the center of a mirror is followed by applying the law of reflection; it makes the same angle with the axis when leaving as when approaching. (See ray 2 in {'Figure26_7_4 Figure26.7.4}.)
      4. A ray approaching a concave converging mirror through its focal point is reflected parallel to its axis. (The reverse of rays 1 and 3 in {'Figure26_7_2 Figure26.7.2}.)
      5. A ray approaching a convex diverging mirror by heading toward its focal point on the opposite side is reflected parallel to the axis. (The reverse of rays 1 and 3 in {'Figure26_7_3 Figure26.7.3}.)
    
    We will use ray tracing to illustrate how images are formed by mirrors, and we can use ray tracing quantitatively to obtain numerical information. But since we assume each mirror is small compared with its radius of curvature, we can use the thin lens equations for mirrors just as we did for lenses.
    
    Consider the situation shown in {'Figure26_7_4 Figure26.7.4}, concave spherical mirror reflection, in which an object is placed farther from a concave (converging) mirror than its focal length. That is, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;f&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> is positive and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mrow><mtext>o</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;d rSub &#123; size 8&#123;o&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> > <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:fo="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:xsl-fo-compatible:1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;f&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>, so that we may expect an image similar to the case 1 real image formed by a converging lens. Ray tracing in {'Figure26_7_4 Figure26.7.4} shows that the rays from a common point on the object all cross at a point on the same side of the mirror as the object. Thus a real image can be projected onto a screen placed at this location. The image distance is positive, and the image is inverted, so its magnification is negative. This is a  *case 1 image for mirrors*. It differs from the case 1 image for lenses only in that the image is on the same side of the mirror as the object. It is otherwise identical.
