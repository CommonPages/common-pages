  * Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects and is corrected with a diverging lens to reduce power.
  * Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects and is corrected with a converging lens to increase power.
  * In myopia and hyperopia, the corrective lenses produce images at a distance that the person can see clearlyâ€”the far point and near point, respectively.
