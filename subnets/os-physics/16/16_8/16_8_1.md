  * A systemâ€™s natural frequency is the frequency at which the system will oscillate if not affected by driving or damping forces.
  * A periodic force driving a harmonic oscillator at its natural frequency produces resonance. The system is said to resonate.
  * The less damping a system has, the higher the amplitude of the forced oscillations near resonance. The more damping a system has, the broader response it has to varying driving frequencies.
