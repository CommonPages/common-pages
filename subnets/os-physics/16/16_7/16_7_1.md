  * Damped harmonic oscillators have non-conservative forces that dissipate their energy. 
  * Critical damping returns the system to equilibrium as fast as possible without overshooting. 
  * An underdamped system will oscillate through the equilibrium position.
  * An overdamped system moves more slowly toward equilibrium than one that is critically damped.
