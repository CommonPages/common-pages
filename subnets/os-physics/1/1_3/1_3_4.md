name: Summary

  * Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value.
  * Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements.
  * The precision of a  *measuring tool* is related to the size of its measurement increments. The smaller the measurement increment, the more precise the tool.
  * Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.
  * When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value.
  * When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value.
