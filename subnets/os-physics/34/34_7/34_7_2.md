name: On the Intermediate Scale

  1.  *How do phase transitions take place on the microscopic scale*? We know a lot about phase transitions, such as water freezing, but the details of how they occur molecule by molecule are not well understood. Similar questions about specific heat a century ago led to early quantum mechanics. It is also an example of a complex adaptive system that may yield insights into other self-organizing systems.
  2.  *Is there a way to deal with nonlinear phenomena that reveals underlying connections*? Nonlinear phenomena lack a direct or linear proportionality that makes analysis and understanding a little easier. There are implications for nonlinear optics and broader topics such as chaos.
  3.  *How do high- Tc size 12&#123;T rSub &#123; size 8&#123;c&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125; superconductors become resistanceless at such high temperatures*? Understanding how they work may help make them more practical or may result in surprises as unexpected as the discovery of superconductivity itself.
  4.  *There are magnetic effects in materials we do not understandâ€”how do they work*? Although beyond the scope of this text, there is a great deal to learn in condensed matter physics (the physics of solids and liquids). We may find surprises analogous to lasing, the quantum Hall effect, and the quantization of magnetic flux. Complexity may play a role here, too.
