  * Dark matter **** is non-luminous matter detected in and around galaxies and galactic clusters.
  * It may be 10 times the mass of the luminous matter in the universe, and its amount may determine whether the universe is open or closed (expands forever or eventually stops).
  * The determining factor is the critical density **** of the universe and the cosmological constant, a theoretical construct intimately related to the expansion and closure of the universe.
  * The critical density  *ρ*<sub>c</sub>  is the density needed to just halt universal expansion. It is estimated to be approximately 10<sup>–26</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>.
  * An open universe is negatively curved, a closed universe is positively curved, whereas a universe with exactly the critical density is flat.
  * Dark matter’s composition is a major mystery, but it may be due to the suspected mass of neutrinos or a completely unknown type of leptonic matter.
  * If neutrinos have mass, they will change families, a process known as neutrino oscillations, for which there is growing evidence.
