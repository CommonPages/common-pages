  * Buoyant force is the net upward force on any object in any fluid. If the buoyant force is greater than the object’s weight, the object will rise to the surface and float. If the buoyant force is less than the object’s weight, the object will sink. If the buoyant force equals the object’s weight, the object will remain suspended at that depth. The buoyant force is always present whether the object floats, sinks, or is suspended in a fluid.
  * Archimedes’ principle states that the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces.
  * Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid (usually water).
