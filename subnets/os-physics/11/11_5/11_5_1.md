name:     Application of Pascal’s Principle

One of the most important technological applications of Pascal’s principle is found in a  *hydraulic system*, which is an enclosed fluid system used to exert forces. The most common hydraulic systems are those that operate car brakes. Let us first consider the simple hydraulic system shown in {'Figure_12_5_1a Figure 12.5.1a}.
