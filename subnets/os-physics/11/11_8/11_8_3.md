  * Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces.
  * Attractive forces between molecules of different types are called adhesive forces.
  * Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension.
  * Capillary action is the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube which is due to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces.
