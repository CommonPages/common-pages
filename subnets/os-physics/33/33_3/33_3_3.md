name: Summary

  * A variety of particle accelerators have been used to explore the nature of subatomic particles and to test predictions of particle theories. 
  * Modern accelerators used in particle physics are either large synchrotrons or linear accelerators. 
  * The use of colliding beams makes much greater energy available for the creation of particles, and collisions between matter and antimatter allow a greater range of final products.
