name: Summary

  * Hadrons are thought to be composed of quarks, with baryons having three quarks and mesons having a quark and an antiquark. 
  * The characteristics of the six quarks and their antiquark counterparts are given in , and the quark compositions of certain hadrons are given in . 
  * Indirect evidence for quarks is very strong, explaining all known hadrons and their quantum numbers, such as strangeness, charm, topness, and bottomness. 
  * Quarks come in six flavors and three colors and occur only in combinations that produce white.
  * Fundamental particles have no further substructure, not even a size beyond their de Broglie wavelength. 
  * There are three types of fundamental particlesâ€”leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. Each type is divided into three analogous families as indicated in {'Figure_34_5_6 Figure 34.5.6}.
