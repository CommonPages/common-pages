name: The Three Families

Fundamental particles are thought to be one of three types—leptons, quarks, or carrier particles. Each of those three types is further divided into three analogous families as illustrated in {'Figure_34_5_6 Figure 34.5.6}. We have examined leptons and quarks in some detail. Each has six members (and their six antiparticles) divided into three analogous families. The first family is normal matter, of which most things are composed. The second is exotic, and the third more exotic and more massive than the second. The only stable particles are in the first family, which also has unstable members.

Always searching for symmetry and similarity, physicists have also divided the carrier particles into three families, omitting the graviton. Gravity is special among the four forces in that it affects the space and time in which the other forces exist and is proving most difficult to include in a Theory of Everything or TOE (to stub the pretension of such a theory). Gravity is thus often set apart. It is not certain that there is meaning in the groupings shown in {'Figure_34_5_6 Figure 34.5.6}, but the analogies are tempting. In the past, we have been able to make significant advances by looking for analogies and patterns, and this is an example of one under current scrutiny. There are connections between the families of leptons, in that the <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>τ</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;τ&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> decays into the <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;μ&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> and the <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;μ&#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> into the  *e*. Similarly for quarks, the higher families eventually decay into the lowest, leaving only  *u* and  *d* quarks. We have long sought connections between the forces in nature. Since these are carried by particles, we will explore connections between gluons, <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>W</mi><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">±</mo><mrow/></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;W rSup &#123; size 8&#123; +- &#123;&#125;&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math> and <math xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:md="http://cnx.rice.edu/mdml" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>Z</mi><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12&#123;Z rSup &#123; size 8&#123;0&#125; &#125; &#125; &#123;&#125;</annotation></semantics></math>, and photons as part of the search for unification of forces discussed in <link:>..
