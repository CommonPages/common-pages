name: Summary

  * Convection is heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of mass. Convection can be natural or forced and generally transfers thermal energy faster than conduction.  gives wind-chill factors, indicating that moving air has the same chilling effect of much colder stationary air.  *Convection that occurs along with a phase change* can transfer energy from cold regions to warm ones.
