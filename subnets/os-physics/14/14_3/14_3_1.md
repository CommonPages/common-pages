name: Problem-Solving Strategies for the Effects of Heat Transfer

  1.  *Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system?* When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in stepsâ€”temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on.
  2.  *Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase.*
  3.  *Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).* A written list is useful.
  4.  *Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).*
  5.  *Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).* If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see ) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See .
  6.  *Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units.* You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change).
  7.  *Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?* As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.
