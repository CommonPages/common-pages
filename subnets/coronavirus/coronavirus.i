  Coronaviruses are huge family of virus species that infecfts animal (Chickens, Pigs, Humans etc) cells.
  Corona means crown and refers to the large crown like spikes sticking out of their membranes. These protein spikes are sticky. They don't attach to most objects but are extremely sticky when they bump into specific molecules on outsides of animal cells. Once helds firmly in place, the coronavirus waits until swallowed by the cell. It then begins to reproduce within that cell.
  Different animals have different types of molecules outside their cells. Because of this, Bird infecting coronavirus usually can't infect humans as their spikes doesn't hold strong enough to our cells.
