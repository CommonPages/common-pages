  / What is the immune system and how does it work?
  let system >
    The immune system is a collection of unique cells and substances they produce, that act as the body’s defense mechanism against infections and anything ‘foreign.’

    Immune cells travel through the body and keep track of all cells and substances normally found in the body. These cells are trained to recognize pathogens like bacteria, viruses, etc. and abnormal cells in the body as ‘foreign’ and eliminate them.

    This process of recognition and elimination is based on the presence of molecules (such as proteins) on the surface of all cells that the immune cells use to distinguish between ‘self’ and foreign.

  / What is Cancer Immunotherapy?
  let therapy >
    Immunotherapy is a treatment modality that employs several different tricks to stimulate the patient’s own immune system to fight their cancer.
    Cancer cells have devised unique ways to evade surveillance and elimination by the immune system by cloaking themselves to appear as normal cells.
    Immunotherapy aims to either specifically un-‘cloak’ these cancer cells and expose them to the immune system, OR, train the immune system to fight harder and smarter in a general, non-specific fashion.
    Immunotherapy holds great potential for treating cancer, as no other therapy can compare with the elaborate network of cellular interactions and pathways employed by the human body to rid itself of foreign entities.

  / Immunotherapy has several advantages over chemotherapy and targeted therapy
  let advantage >
    Traditionally, lung cancer has not been considered an immune-responsive cancer given the very limited benefit seen with earlier immunotherapeutic agents such as bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination, interleukin (IL)-2, interferons etc. However, recent data coming in on early phase clinical trials of various new immunotherapies for lung cancer show immense promise in terms of response rates and survival advantages that outweigh anything else currently available, typically adding months, if not years to life expectancy for lung cancer patients. However, these therapies are relatively new, still in the experimental stage (not FDA-approved) and there are several characteristics about patient selection for therapy, patient response, therapy resistance that we currently do not understand.
    With that being said, immunotherapy has several advantages over chemotherapy and targeted therapy:
      - Immunotherapy has demonstrated a low toxicity profile relative to chemotherapy and targeted therapy.
      - Because the biological system is sensitive to even very minor alterations, the immune system can detect relatively low numbers of cancer cells and mount a response to eliminate them.
      - The immune system has a strong ‘memory,’ in that it remembers the foreign cells it was exposed to and each time it encounters those cells again, it gets activated and works to eliminate them. This immune memory bestows longer lasting tumor control, as against chemotherapy and targeted therapy that need to be constantly replenished in the body. Since immune responses stimulated by immunotherapy, once generated, are always remembered by the body and activated each time cancer recurs, this therapeutic modality produces durable, sustained tumor response. 

  / What are the various types of immunotherapy effective for lung cancer?
  let types >
    There are currently three types of immunotherapies that are being evaluated to treat cancer, listed below.
      1. Immune modulators such as Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
      2. Cancer Vaccines
      3. Adoptive T cell Transfer
    Four drugs belonging to the first category of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors are now FDA-approved for use by patients with unresectable Stage III and advanced, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients. These drugs are Durvalumab (IMFINZI, manufactured by AstraZeneca), Nivolumab (Opdivo, manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb), Pembrolizumab (Keytruda, manufactured by Merck) and Atezolizumab (Tecentriq, manufactured by Genentech).

  / What are Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors? 
  let inhibitors >
    The main role of the immune system is to keep track of what is ‘self’ and, identify and eliminate anything that is ‘foreign.’ In order to prevent the immune system from attacking its own normal ‘self’ cells, the body has evolved several checks and balances that keep the immune system under control.These checks and balances are like the brakes in a car that prevent the car from going into overdrive, and are designed to prevent or abort actions that could be self-destructive.

    A breach in these systems results in the immune system recognizing normal cells as ‘non-self’ and eliminating them, resulting in auto-immune diseases like lupus and arthritis. Cancer cells have evolved ways and means to overtake these normal checkpoints, locally block the immune response in the vicinity of the tumor, and effectively escape detection and elimination by the immune system.

    Two immune checkpoints that have been targeted recently to lift the brakes from the immune system so that it goes full force to attack cancer cells are CTLA4 and PD-1/PDL1. Checkpoint inhibitors basically undo the local blockade of the immune response evoked by cancer cells and allow the immune system to resume normal function and attack the tumor.

  / How do PD-1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors work?
  let pd1 >
    PD-1 stands for Programmed Death receptor-1. It is a protein expressed on the surface of immune cells, specifically T cells, a kind of white blood cells that fight infection and other foreign bodies. PD-1 interacts with a protein on the surface of normal cells of the body, PDL1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1). This PD1-PDL1 interaction is an immune checkpoint, i.e. a signal to the immune system to not mount an attack on the body’s own cells.

    Cancer cells usurp this mechanism and express PDL1 on their surface to fool the immune system into believing that they are normal cells. Therefore, blocking the PD-1/ PDL1 interaction is the target for anti-cancer immunotherapy, as PD-1 or PDL1 inhibitors allow the immune system to then recognize the cancer cells as foreign and eliminate them.

    It is encouraging that lung cancer cells express PDL1 on their surface and are therefore amenable to PD-1 and PDL1 blockade. PD-1/ PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors are molecules that bind to either PD-1 (expressed on immune cells) or PDL1 (expressed on cancer cells) and block the surface of these proteins, preventing them from interacting with each other.

    The tolerability of these immune checkpoint inhibitors has been generally good, with few dose-limiting toxicities reported. The most common irAEs or immune related Adverse Events reported are: dermatologic (rash, pruritus, and vitiligo), gastrointestinal (diarrhea and colitis), endocrine (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), and hepatic (hepatitis and increased liver function enzymes) events, as well as pneumonitis, uveitis, infusion-related events, and fatigue.

    A Phase III clinical trial assessing the efficacy of an antibody that blocks PD-L1 found that the treatment improved progression-free survival by more than 11 months compared to a placebo in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC.

    ### PD-1 vs. PDL1
    Although the response rates are similar for the inhibitors that bind to PD-1 on immune cells and those that block PD-L1 on tumor cells, early data suggest that there may be a slight safety advantage in targeting PD-L1. A phase I trial of a PD-1 inhibitor reported a 3% incidence of drug-related pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung tissue) but this side effect has so far been less severe or absent with the PD-L1 inhibitors.

    ### Effects in smokers vs. non-smokers
    Early results suggest that both kinds of inhibitors-anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1- seem to benefit smokers more than non-smokers. Results of a phase I trial of a PD-L1 inhibitor presented at the 2013 European Cancer Congress indicated that 26% of smokers responded to the drug, but only 10% of never-smokers responded. Researchers speculate that this is probably due to the greater number of mutations present in smokers’ tumors, an abundance that would probably present the newly awakened immune response with a far greater array of tumor antigens to respond to, and mount a response against.

  / Which immunotherapeutic drugs are currently approved for the treatment of lung cancer?
  let drugs >
    Currently, three immunotherapy drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, whose disease has progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, or in some cases, targeted therapy.

    Two of these drugs are anti-PD1 inhibitors- Nivolumab (Opdivo, manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb) and Pembrolizumab (Keytruda, manufactured by Merck), and third drug is an anti-PDL1 inhibitor- Atezolizumab (Tecentriq, manufactured by Genentech). These immunotherapeutic drugs are proteins called monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to either PD-1 (Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab) or PDL1 (Atezolizumab) and take the brakes off the immune system, so that it can mount a powerful and sustained response against a patients’ tumors.

    A fourth immunotherapy, the anti-PD-L1 inhibitor Durvalumab (IMFINZI, manufactured by AstraZeneca), is the first FDA-approved treatment for patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSLCLC) whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT).

  / What are the differences in the use of the four Immunotherapy drugs for Lung Cancer?
  let differences >
    One differentiating factor between these four approved immunotherapy drugs is the need for PDL1 companion diagnostic testing, i.e. testing for the presence of the protein PDL1 on patients’ tumors. Treatment by Nivolumab, atezolizumab, or Durvalab does not require PDL1 testing, while treatment by Pembrolizumab does.

    Pembrolizumab use requires initial testing for the presence of the protein PDL1 on a patient’s tumors, by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test- the immunohistochemistry (IHC) test called the PDL1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test. This is the first companion diagnostic test that has been approved to check for the expression/ presence of the PDL1 protein in NSCLC tumors. This is an important advance, because the use of the companion diagnostic test will potentially help to identify NSCLC patients most likely to respond to this therapy and benefit from it. This companion diagnostic test is made commercially available to laboratories in the U.S. through Dako North America Inc., and testing using the assay is available at U.S. reference laboratories including Laboratory Corporation of America® Holdings (LabCorp®), Quest Diagnostics, and GE Healthcare Clarient Diagnostic Services.

    Another difference between the use of Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab and Durvalumab is the schedules of administration and dosing of the drugs. Pembrolizumab has been approved for administration every 3 weeks at 2mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes, while Nivolumab has been approved for use every 2 weeks at 3 mg/kg intravenously, over 60 minutes.
    The third difference, as mentioned earlier, is that Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab are anti-PD1 medicines, while Atezolizumab and Durvalumab are anti-PDL1 medicines. It is not clear if one drug is better than the other, and the decision to go on any one of these should be made in consultation with your physician.

  / What are the side effects of treatment with Immunotherapeutic drugs?
  let side_effects >
    Most common side effects observed in the clinical trials that evaluated these four immunotherapeutic agents for lung cancer patients were fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea, cough and pneumonitis. However, it is important to note that immunotherapeutic agents may be associated with immune-mediated side effects in the lungs, colon and hormone-producing glands. Immune-mediated adverse reactions observed with these drugs in clinical trials have included pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, these immunotherapeutic drugs should either be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids should be administered. 

  / How can I access an immunotherapy drug for my lung cancer?
  let access >

  / What is CTLA4?
  let ctla4 >
    CTLA4 stands for Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4. It is expressed on immune cells, such as the T cells, and plays a major role in activating immune response.

    Ipilimumab (Yervoy®) is the first checkpoint inhibitor that was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. It is currently being evaluated to treat other solid tumors like lung and renal cancer. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody which targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint on activated immune cells, and has been approved for use in other cancers such as melanoma. Ipilimumab is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of lung cancer patients. Contact your physician or the Addario Lung Cancer Foundation to learn more about these clinical trials, and how you can participate.

    Tremelimumab, another antibody targeting the CTLA-4 molecule, is being tested in a phase II clinical trial for patients with mesothelioma and lung cancer.

  / What is Combination Therapy?
  let combination >
    Combination therapy is combining one or more different therapeutics for increased efficacy and tumor shrinkage, such that the effects of the combination are greater than the effects produced by sum of the parts. Combining two different therapeutics may be sequential (one after the other) or concurrent (both therapies administered together).

    Studies are underway to understand if and how immunotherapy may be combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These studies are based on the hypotheses that the antigens released from dying cancer cells upon effective chemotherapy, may serve to stimulate the immune system, mount a tumor-specific immune response, and thereby enhance the efficacy of the immunotherapeutic.

    A combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor Ipilimumab with chemotherapy has shown encouraging results in both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. Combinations of anti-PD1/PD-L1 and CTLA4 immunotherapeutic agents are also being evaluated for lung cancer patients, including the combination of Nivolumab and anti- Ipilimumab (source: BMS) as well as the combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab (source: AstraZeneca). 

    ### Combination immune checkpoint approaches
    Studies are also underway to evaluate dual checkpoint blockade to increase the proportion and durability of tumor responses. Early evidence suggests that combination strategies that involve immune checkpoint blockade may have additive effects in the clinic. In patients with advanced melanoma, combination therapy with nivolumab and Ipilimumab showed preliminary activity much greater than that seen in previous experience with either agent alone: 40% of patients on a concurrent regimen had an objective response, and 65% had evidence of clinical activity.

    Ongoing trials in lung cancer exploring combinatorial checkpoint blockade will provide further insight into the use of these new therapies for lung cancer patients. New data from immunotherapy studies points to the fact that combining immune checkpoint inhibitors holds the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy.

  / What are cancer vaccines?
  let vaccines >
    A vaccine is typically a biological agent used to stimulate and train the immune system to recognize this agent as ‘foreign’, mount a response to eliminate it from the body, and create ‘memory’ such that if the agent is encountered again, the body readily clears it from the system.
    Vaccines may be either prophylatic (they prevent future infection by the agent) or therapeutic (they treat current infections).
    Cancer vaccines are therapeutic. These vaccines use proteins expressed on the surface of cancer cells to train the immune system to recognize tumors and destroy them.

    So far, there is only one FDA-approved vaccine for cancer: Provenge approved for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in April 2010.
    There is excitement around the use of cancer vaccines for lung cancer as lung tumors over-express specific proteins such as MAGE-3 (overexpressed in 42% of all lung cancers, 35% early stage and 55% late stage NSCLCs), NY-ESO-1 (overexpressed in 30% of all lung cancers), p53 (overexpressed in 50% of lung cancers), survivin, MUC-1, etc., which can serve as agents to train the immune system to recognize these proteins on cancer cells and specifically kill those cells.

  / What is Adoptive T Cell Transfer?
  let tcell >
    The third major type of immunotherapy currently being evaluated for lung cancer is adoptive T Cell transfer which is a process that involves 1) removing a patient’s immune cells, specifically the T cells from their body, 2) treating these cells with various chemicals and other biological factors in a lab dish such that they recognize antigens on tumors and mount a strong immune response, and 3) re-inject these activated immune cells back into the patient’s body.

  / Patient response to cancer immunotherapy
  let response >
    One of the challenges of immunotherapy for lung cancer is the variability in patient response: while some patients see very durable and lasting responses, others only get a partial response to the therapy and progress, while others see no response at all.

    Studies are underway to understand the underlying reasons for these differences in response to immunotherapy in lung cancer patients. These studies will hopefully uncover biomarkers of response to these therapies that can be used to better select patients who are most likely to respond, while sparing toxicity and side effects in those unlikely to respond, thereby allow tailoring therapy to patients based on the specifics of their cancer.

    Since immunotherapies are designed to stimulate the immune system, these agents are not suited for patients that have a history of autoimmune disorders or previous immunosuppressive therapy.

  / The Future Holds Promise
  let future >
    Immunotherapy holds promise to be a critical component in the care of lung cancer patients across the spectrum, all the way from neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and maintenance therapy. Its ability to unlock the patient’s own immune system and stimulate it to eradicate cancer has immense potential that is only now beginning to be understood. With that being said, there are still several mechanistic and clinical unknowns that are currently being evaluated to fully utilize these therapies in a way that’s best suited for lung cancer patients.

    ## Ongoing studies are currently evaluating:
    - The use of immunotherapies earlier in the treatment journey. The four immunotherapeutic drugs currently approved for lung cancer patients have been approved for use in the second line setting, i.e. for patients that have received either chemotherapy or targeted therapies, and have progressed during or on these treatments, except for Durvalumab, which is for patients who have not yet progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Current clinical trials underway are evaluating the use of immunotherapeutic agents for treating newly diagnosed lung cancer patients, upfront, in the front-line setting. Early data from these clinical trials show that Pembrolizumab has promising activity in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients whose tumors express PDL1 (greater than 50%). These early data show that monotherapy with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors in the front line setting might be best served in patients that are PDL1-positive.

    Also under current evaluation are combinations of immunotherapeutic agents with other kinds of therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy and targeted therapies. These combinations are currently in clinical trials. Contact the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation at portal@ lungcancerfoundation.org to find out how you can participate in these trials, and access these treatments.

    ### 1. Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy:
    The rationale for the combinations is clear. Chemotherapy will kill cancer cells, causing the release of cancer antigens or proteins inside the cancer cell, which get exposed to the immune system. With the immunotherapy drugs, the immune system is now primed to mount a response to these antigens for a meaningful and deeper response. Early data from the combination of Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed, previously never treated patients show that this combination is effective even in patients whose tumors do not express high levels of PDL1.

    ### 2. Immunotherapy + Immunotherapy:
    Combinations of two different immunotherapeutic agents are being evaluated for lung cancer patients in two studies, as noted below.
      - Combination of anti-PD1 Nivolumab and anti-CTLA4 Ipilimumab. This combination has been approved for the treatment of melanoma patients and is showing promise for lung cancer patients.
      - Combination of durvalumab (anti-PDL1) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4). This combination is being studied for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type locally-advanced or metastatic (Stage IV) 1st-line NSCLC. Source: Reference: AstraZeneca

    ### 3. Immunotherapy + Radiation Therapy:
    For several years we have known about an interesting phenomenon with RT called the abscopal effect (ab-scopus, away from target) where we see tumor regression in lesions distant from the targeted site. Now RT also release antigens from dying cancer cells that can prime the immune system to mount an attack. Combining RT with immunotherapy therefore holds potential, as release of antigens combined with a primed immune system that has its ‘brakes’ removed will form the perfect storm to completely wipe out the tumor. This hypothesis is currently being tested in several clinical trials for lung cancer patients.
      - 4. Immunotherapy + Targeted Therapy:
        - These combinations are one of the ways in which we can convert ‘cold’ tumors that do not respond to immunotherapies (because these tumors do not have enough immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, also called ‘immune deserts’) to ‘hot’ tumors. There is emerging data to support that some targeted therapies can increase the influx of immune cells (T cells) into the tumor microenvironment, and combining these with the immunotherapeutic agent makes sure that these cells mount an attack against the tumor.

    - The most appropriate dose and duration of immunotherapy.

    - Where immunotherapies stand in the lung cancer treatment continuum, what the optimal timing is for their administration, depending on tumor load and the stage of the disease. Can we re-administer immunotherapeutic agents after responders progress? If we do re-administer, should it be just with a single agent or a combination? What is the optimal duration?

    - The variations in patient response to immunotherapy (why some patients respond while others do not, why do some patients have durable responses that last while others relapse quickly), such that these therapeutics can be tailored to patients based on the underlying specifics of their disease.

    - Specific biomarkers for patient selection and disease response.
