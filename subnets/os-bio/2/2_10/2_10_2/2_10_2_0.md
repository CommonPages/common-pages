name: The Cell Cycle - Introduction

The  **cell cycle** is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase ({'Figure_10_2_1 Figure 10.2.1}). During  **interphase**, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the  **mitotic phase**, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.
