# G<sub>0 </sub>Phase

Not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase. Cells in  **G0 phase** are not actively preparing to divide. The cell is in a  **quiescent** (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G<sub>0</sub> temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of G<sub>1</sub>. Other cells that never or rarely divide, such as mature cardiac muscle and nerve cells, remain in G<sub>0</sub> permanently.
