name: The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis - Introduction

How can light energy be used to make food? When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build basic carbohydrate molecules ({'Figure_8_2_1 Figure 8.2.1}). However, autotrophs only use a few specific wavelengths of sunlight.
