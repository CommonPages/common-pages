name: Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors - Introduction

There are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells. Communication between cells is called  **intercellular signaling**, and communication within a cell is called  **intracellular signaling**. An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes: inter- means "between" (for example, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) and intra- means "inside" (like intravenous).

Chemical signals are released by  **signaling cells** in the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands. A  **ligand** is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal in the process. Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules. Ligands interact with proteins in  **target cells**, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called  **receptors**. Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand.
