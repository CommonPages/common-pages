name: Response to the Signal - Introduction

Inside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to directly affect the cellâ€™s DNA and protein-producing machinery. Using signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety of effects on the cell. The results of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the external and internal conditions. A small sampling of responses is described below.
