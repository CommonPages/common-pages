name: Connections of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Lipid Metabolic Pathways - Introduction

You have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells. But living things consume more than glucose for food. How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your cells? This happens because all of the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways (see  {'Figure_7_6_2 Figure 7.6.2}). Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porousâ€”that is, substances enter from other pathways, and intermediates leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems. Many of the substrates, intermediates, and products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.
