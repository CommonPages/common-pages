name: Acetyl CoA to CO2

# Acetyl CoA to CO<sub>2</sub>

In the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl (2C) group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate, a six-carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule and release the remaining four CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. This single pathway is called by different names: the  **citric acid cycle** (for the first intermediate formed—citric acid, or citrate—when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the  **TCA cycle** (because citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and the  **Krebs cycle**, after Hans Krebs, who first identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.
