name: Prokaryotic Cells - Introduction

Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Only the predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- = “before”; -kary- = “nucleus”). Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes (eu- = “true”) and are made up of eukaryotic cells.
