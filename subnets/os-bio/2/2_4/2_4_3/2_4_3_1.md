name: The Plasma Membrane

Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a  **plasma membrane** ({'Figure_4_3_2 Figure 4.3.2}), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment. A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group. The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell. Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing through the plasma membrane.

The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption fold into fingerlike projections that we call microvilli (singular = microvillus); ({'Figure_4_3_3a Figure 4.3.3a}). Such cells typically line the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of form following function.
People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.
