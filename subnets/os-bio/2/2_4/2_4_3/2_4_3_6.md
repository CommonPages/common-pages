name: Peroxisomes

 **Peroxisomes** are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into oxygen and water.) For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars. Plant cells contain many different types of peroxisomes that play a role in metabolism, pathogene defense, and stress response, to mention a few.
