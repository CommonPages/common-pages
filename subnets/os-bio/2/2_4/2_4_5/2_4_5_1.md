name: Microfilaments

Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton,  **microfilaments** are the narrowest. They function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are comprised of two globular protein intertwined strands, which we call actin ({'Figure_4_5_2 Figure 4.5.2}). For this reason, we also call microfilaments actin filaments.

ATP powers actin to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein we call myosin. This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in eukaryotic cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the cell cytoplasm's circular movement in plant cells. Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells. When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.

Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your bodyâ€™s infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability. They can move to an infection site and phagocytize the pathogen.
