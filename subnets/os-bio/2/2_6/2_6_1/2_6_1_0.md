name: Energy and Metabolism - Introduction

Scientists use the term  **bioenergetics** to discuss the concept of energy flow ({'Figure_6_1_1 Figure 6.1.1}) through living systems, such as cells. Cellular processes such as building and breaking down complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions. Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy; whereas, others require energy to proceed. Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what they have used, cells must continually obtain more energy to replenish that which the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place use. All of the chemical reactions that transpire inside cells, including those that use and release energy, are the cellâ€™s  **metabolism**.
