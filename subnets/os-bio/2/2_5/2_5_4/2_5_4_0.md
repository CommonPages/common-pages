name: Bulk Transport - Introduction

In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles (see   for examples). Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.
