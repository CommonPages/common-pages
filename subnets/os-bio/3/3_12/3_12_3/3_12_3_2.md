name: Alleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive

Mendel’s  **law of dominance** states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain “latent” but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele ({'Figure_12_3_1 Figure 12.3.1}), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.

Since Mendel’s experiments with pea plants, researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold true. Instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.
