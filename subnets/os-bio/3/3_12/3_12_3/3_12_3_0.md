name: Laws of Inheritance - Introduction

Mendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four postulates, some of which are sometimes called “laws,” that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms. As you have learned, more complex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F<sub>2</sub> phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws summarize the basics of classical genetics.
