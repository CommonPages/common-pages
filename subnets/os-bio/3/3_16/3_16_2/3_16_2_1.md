# The  *trp* Operon: A Repressor Operon

Bacteria such as  *E. coli* need amino acids to survive.  **Tryptophan** is one such amino acid that  *E. coli* can ingest from the environment.  *E. coli* can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the  **tryptophan (trp) operon** (). If tryptophan is present in the environment, then  *E. coli* does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the  *trp* operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.

A DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the  **transcriptional start site**. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.

A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first  *trp* coding gene. This  **operator** contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the  *trp* repressor, which changes shape to bind to the  *trp* operator. Binding of the tryptophanâ€“repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes.

When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off, the  *trp* operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence  *trp* expression are  **negative regulators**.
