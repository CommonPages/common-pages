name: Prokaryotic Gene Regulation - Introduction

The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called  **operons**. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or  *lac*) operon.

In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers.  **Repressors** are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas  **activators** are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.
