    The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome, supercoiled within the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called  **operons**. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or  *lac*) operon, and transcribed into a single mRNA.
    
    In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. Repressors and activators are proteins produced in the cell. Both repressors and activators regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sites  *adjacent* to the genes they control.  *In general, activators bind to the promoter site, while repressors bind to operator regions*.  **Repressors** prevent transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas  **activators** increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Inducers are small molecules that may be produced by the cell or that are in the cellâ€™s environment. Inducers either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.
