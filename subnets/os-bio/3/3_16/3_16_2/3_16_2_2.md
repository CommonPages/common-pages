name: Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator

Just as the  *trp* operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a  **positive regulator** to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce,  *E. coli* bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in  *E. coli*. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator  **catabolite activator protein (CAP)**, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources ({'Figure_16_2_2 Figure 16.2.2}). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.
