name: Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): A Transcriptional Activator

Just as the  *trp* operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the promoter sequences that act as  **positive regulators** to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce,  *E. coli* bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate sugars must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in  *E. coli*. Accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator  **catabolite activator protein (CAP)**, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons which control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex then binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources ({'Figure_16_2_2 Figure 16.2.2}). In these operons, a CAP-binding site is located upstream of the RNA-polymerase-binding site in the promoter. CAP binding stabilizes the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and increases transcription of the associated protein-coding genes.
