# The  *lac* Operon: An Inducer Operon

The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through  **inducible operons**, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The  *lac* operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously,  *E. coli* is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. To do so, the cAMPâ€“CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar source is lactose. The  **lac operon** encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the  *lac* operon. However, for the  *lac* operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the  *lac* operon be transcribed (). This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.

If glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off. Only when both conditions are satisfied is the  *lac* operon transcribed ().
