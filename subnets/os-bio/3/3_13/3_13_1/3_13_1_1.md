name: Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to examine Mendel’s publications and reevaluate his model in terms of chromosome behavior during mitosis and meiosis. In 1902, Theodor Boveri observed that proper sea urchin embryonic development does not occur unless chromosomes are present. That same year, Walter Sutton observed chromosome separation into daughter cells during meiosis ({'Figure_13_1_1 Figure 13.1.1}). Together, these observations led to the  **Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance**, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian inheritance.

The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel’s laws, which the following observations supported:

  * During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of other chromosome pairs.
  * Chromosome sorting from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random.
  * Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half their chromosomal complement.
  * Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the same number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.
  * The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents.

Despite compelling correlations between chromosome behavior during meiosis and Mendel’s abstract laws, scientists proposed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance long before there was any direct evidence that chromosomes carried traits. Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes. It was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly,  *Drosophila melanogaster*, that Thomas Hunt Morgan provided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.
