Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Researchers are applying genomics to most fields of biology. They use it for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, studying drug interactions before conducting clinical trials, and studying microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. They are also applying it to developments such as generating new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.
