name: Genomics in Agriculture

Genomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve agricultural crop yield quality and quantity. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism. Researchers are discovering how genomics can improve agricultural production's quality and quantity. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.
