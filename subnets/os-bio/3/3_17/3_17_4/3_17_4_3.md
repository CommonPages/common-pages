name: Microbial Genomics: Metagenomics

Traditionally, scholars have taught microbiology with the view that it is best to study microorganisms under  **pure culture** conditions. This involves isolating a single cell type and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist culturing in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities or biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms.  **Metagenomics** is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment ({'Figure_B17_6_1 Figure B17.6.1}).
