name: Cellular Cloning

Unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as  **cellular cloning**. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact replica of the genetic material.
