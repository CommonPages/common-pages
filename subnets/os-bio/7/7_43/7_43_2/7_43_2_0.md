name: Fertilization - Introduction

Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either inside ( **internal fertilization**) or outside ( **external fertilization**) the body of the female. Humans provide an example of the former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter.
