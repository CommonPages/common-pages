name: Human Pregnancy and Birth - Introduction

Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. The length of time of  **gestation** varies among animals, but is very similar among the great apes: human gestation is 266 days, while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days, a gorillaâ€™s is 257 days, and orangutan gestation is 260 days long. The fox has a 57-day gestation. Dogs and cats have similar gestations averaging 60 days. The longest gestation for a land mammal is an African elephant at 640 days. The longest gestations among marine mammals are the beluga and sperm whales at 460 days.
