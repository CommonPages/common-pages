name: Hearing and Vestibular Sensation - Introduction

 **Audition**, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions. It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular system is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animalâ€™s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular acceleration and deceleration, and balance.
