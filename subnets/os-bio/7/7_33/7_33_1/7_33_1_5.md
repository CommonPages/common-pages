name: Animal Body Planes and Cavities

A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes. A  **sagittal plane** divides the body into right and left portions. A  **midsagittal plane** divides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves. A  **frontal plane** (also called a coronal plane) separates the front from the back. A  **transverse plane** (or, horizontal plane) divides the animal into upper and lower portions. This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane. {'Figure_33_1_4 Figure 33.1.4} illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged animal) and a human being.

Vertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated in {'Figure_33_1_5 Figure 33.1.5}. Two of these are major cavities that contain smaller cavities within them. The  **dorsal cavity** contains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities. The  **ventral cavity** contains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity, which surrounds the heart. The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity, which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities.
