name: Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces - Introduction

The structure of the lung maximizes its surface area to increase gas diffusion. Because of the enormous number of alveoli (approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m<sup>2</sup>). Having such a large surface area increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs.
