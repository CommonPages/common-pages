A nervous system that functions correctly is a fantastically complex, well-oiled machineâ€”synapses fire appropriately, muscles move when needed, memories are formed and stored, and emotions are well regulated.

While scientists have discovered potential causes of many of these diseases, and viable treatments for some, ongoing research seeks to find ways to better prevent and treat all of these disorders.
