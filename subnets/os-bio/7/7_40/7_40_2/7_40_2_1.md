name: The Role of Blood in the Body

Blood, like the human blood illustrated in {'Figure_40_2_1 Figure 40.2.1} is important for regulation of the bodyâ€™s systems and homeostasis. Blood helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat. Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste. Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents or  **white blood cells** to sites of infection.
