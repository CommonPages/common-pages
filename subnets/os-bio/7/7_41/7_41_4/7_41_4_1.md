name: Nitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals: The Urea Cycle

The  **urea cycle** is the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea. Urea is made in the liver and excreted in urine. The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) + CO<sub>2</sub> + 3 ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O â†’ H<sub>2</sub>N-CO-NH<sub>2</sub> (urea) + 2 ADP + 4 P<sub>i</sub> + AMP.


The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in {'Figure_41_4_1 Figure 41.4.1}. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. Urea concentration in the blood, called  **blood urea nitrogen** or BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function.
