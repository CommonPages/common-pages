name: Classification of Joints on the Basis of Function

The functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. A  **synarthrosis** is a joint that is immovable. This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses.  **Amphiarthroses** are joints that allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses.  **Diarthroses** are joints that allow for free movement of the joint, as in synovial joints.
