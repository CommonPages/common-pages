name: Neural Stimuli

In some cases, the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones, which is referred to as  **neural stimuli**. Recall that in a short-term stress response, the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond. Here, neuronal signaling from the sympathetic nervous system directly stimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress.
