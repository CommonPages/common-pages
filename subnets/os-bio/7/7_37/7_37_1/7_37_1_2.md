name: Amino Acid-Derived Hormones

The  **amino acid-derived hormones** are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, shown in {'Figure_37_1_2ab Figure 37.1.2ab}. If a hormone is amino acid-derived, its chemical name will end in “-ine”. Examples of amino acid-derived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal glands, and thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland. The pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin which regulates sleep cycles.
