name: Organismal Ecology

Researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in specific habitats. These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. For instance, the Karner blue butterfly ( *Lycaeides melissa samuelis*) ({'Figure_44_1_2 Figure 44.1.2}) is considered a specialist because the females only  *oviposit* (that is, lay eggs) on wild lupine ( *Lupinus perennis*). This specific requirement and adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is completely dependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its survival.

After hatching, the (first instar) caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine ({'Figure_44_1_3 Figure 44.1.3}). The caterpillars pupate as a chrysalis to undergo the final stage of metamorphosis and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks. The adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species, such as milkweeds. Generally there are two broods of the Karner blue each year.

A researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about egg laying requirements, ask questions about the butterfliesâ€™ preferred thoracic flight temperature (a physiological question), or the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages (a behavioral question).
