Populations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Species are divided into two categories based on a variety of features of their life history patterns:  *r*-selected species, which have large numbers of offspring, and  *K*-selected species, which have few offspring. The  *r*- and  *K*-selection theory has fallen out of use; however, many of its key features are still used in newer, demographically-based models of population dynamics.
