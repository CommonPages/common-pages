name: Population Genetics - Introduction

Individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of a particular gene, referred to as polymorphisms. Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic. The distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known as the  **population variation**, is influenced by a number of factors, including the populationâ€™s genetic structure and the environment ({'Figure_19_2_1 Figure 19.2.1}). Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures.
