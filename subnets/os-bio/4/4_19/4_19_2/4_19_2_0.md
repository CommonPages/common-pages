name: Population Genetics - Introduction

A population's individuals often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of a particular gene, which scientists refer to as polymorphisms. We call populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics polymorphic. A number of factors, including the populationâ€™s genetic structure and the environment ({'Figure_19_2_1 Figure 19.2.1}) influence  **population variation**, the distribution of phenotypes among individuals. Understanding phenotypic variation sources in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures.
