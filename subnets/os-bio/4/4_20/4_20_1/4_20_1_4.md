Scientists continually gain new information that helps understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Each group of organisms went through its own evolutionary journey, or its phylogeny. Each organism shares relatedness with others, and based on morphologic and genetic evidence, scientists attempt to map the evolutionary pathways of all life on Earth. Historically, scientists organized organisms into a taxonomic classification system. However, today many scientists build phylogenetic trees to illustrate evolutionary relationships.
