name: Excavata

Many of the protist species classified into the supergroup Excavata are asymmetrical, single-celled organisms with a feeding groove “excavated” from one side. This supergroup includes heterotrophic predators, photosynthetic species, and parasites. Its subgroups are the diplomonads, parabasalids, and euglenozoans.

## Diplomonads

Among the Excavata are the diplomonads, which include the intestinal parasite,  *Giardia lamblia*({'Figure_23_3_2 Figure 23.3.2}). Until recently, these protists were believed to lack mitochondria. Mitochondrial remnant organelles, called  **mitosomes**, have since been identified in diplomonads, but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional. Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways, such as glycolysis, to generate energy. Each diplomonad cell has two identical nuclei and uses several flagella for locomotion.

## Parabasalids

A second Excavata subgroup, the parabasalids, also exhibits semi-functional mitochondria. In parabasalids, these structures function anaerobically and are called  **hydrogenosomes** because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct. Parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling.  *Trichomonas vaginalis*, a parabasalid that causes a sexually transmitted disease in humans, employs these mechanisms to transit through the male and female urogenital tracts.  *T*. *vaginalis* causes trichamoniasis, which appears in an estimated 180 million cases worldwide each year. Whereas men rarely exhibit symptoms during an infection with this protist, infected women may become more susceptible to secondary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be more likely to develop cervical cancer. Pregnant women infected with  *T*. *vaginalis*are at an increased risk of serious complications, such as pre-term delivery.

## Euglenozoans

Euglenozoans includes parasites, heterotrophs, autotrophs, and mixotrophs, ranging in size from 10 to 500 µm. Euglenoids move through their aquatic habitats using two long flagella that guide them toward light sources sensed by a primitive ocular organ called an eyespot. The familiar genus,  *Euglena*, encompasses some mixotrophic species that display a photosynthetic capability only when light is present. In the dark, the chloroplasts of  *Euglena*shrink up and temporarily cease functioning, and the cells instead take up organic nutrients from their environment.

The human parasite,  *Trypanosoma brucei*, belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa, the kinetoplastids. The kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the  **kinetoplast**, a DNA mass carried within the single, oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells. This subgroup includes several parasites, collectively called trypanosomes, which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle.  *T*. *brucei*develops in the gut of the tsetse fly after the fly bites an infected human or other mammalian host. The parasite then travels to the insect salivary glands to be transmitted to another human or other mammal when the infected tsetse fly consumes another blood meal.  *T*. *brucei* is common in central Africa and is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, a disease associated with severe chronic fatigue, coma, and can be fatal if left untreated.
