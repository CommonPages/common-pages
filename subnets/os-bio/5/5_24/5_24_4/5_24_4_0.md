name: Fungal Parasites and Pathogens - Introduction

 **Parasitism** describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other. Both parasites and pathogens harm the host; however, pathogens cause disease, damage to host tissues or physiology, whereas parasites usually do not, but can cause serious damage and death by competition for nutrients or other resources.  **Commensalism** occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other.
