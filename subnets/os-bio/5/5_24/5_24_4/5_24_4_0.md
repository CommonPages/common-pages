name: Fungal Parasites and Pathogens - Introduction

 **Parasitism** describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other. Both parasites and pathogens harm the host; however, the pathogen causes a disease, whereas the parasite usually does not.  **Commensalism** occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other.
