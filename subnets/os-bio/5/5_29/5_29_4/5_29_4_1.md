name: Characteristics of Amniotes

The  **amniotic egg** is the key characteristic of amniotes. In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The  *albumin*, or egg white, outside of the chorion provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk contained in the yolk sac provides nutrients for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians. Here are the functions of the extraembryonic membranes:

  1. Blood vessels in the  **yolk sac** transport yolk nutrients to the circulatory system of the embryo.
  2. The  **chorion** facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the eggâ€™s external environment.
  3. The  **allantois** stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration.
  4. The  **amnion** protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration.

In mammals, the yolk sac is very reduced, but the embryo is still cushioned and enclosed within the amnion. The  *placenta,* which transports nutrients and functions in gas exchange and waste management, is derived from the chorion and allantois.

Additional derived characteristics of amniotes include a waterproof skin, accessory keratinized structures, and costal (rib) ventilation of the lungs.
