name: Evolution of Amphibians

The fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods: now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago. Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water, to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period. One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus  **Acanthostega**.  *Acanthostega* was aquatic; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes. However, it also had four limbs, with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods, including amphibians. Therefore, it is thought that  *Acanthostega* lived in shallow waters and was an intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and early, fully terrestrial tetrapods. What preceded  *Acanthostega*?

In 2006, researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a “tetrapod-like fish,”  *Tiktaalik roseae*, which seems to be an intermediate form between fishes having fins and tetrapods having limbs ().  *Tiktaalik* likely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago.<sup>Daeschler, E.

The early tetrapods that moved onto land had access to new nutrient sources and relatively few predators. This led to the widespread distribution of tetrapods during the early Carboniferous period, a period sometimes called the “age of the amphibians.”
