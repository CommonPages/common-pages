name: Structure of Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea - Introduction

There are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The name "prokaryote" suggests that prokaryotes are defined by exclusionâ€”they are not eukaryotes, or organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other internal membrane-bound organelles. However, all cells have four common structures: the plasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and separates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a complex solution of organic molecules and salts inside the cell; a double-stranded DNA genome, the informational archive of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place. Prokaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories:  *cocci* (spherical),  *bacilli* (rod-shaped), and  *spirilli* (spiral-shaped) ({'Figure_22_2_1abc Figure 22.2.1abc}).
