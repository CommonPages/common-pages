name: Prokaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth

When and where did life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? Prokaryotes were the first forms of life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are thought to be about 4.54 billion years old. This estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate material from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular oxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong radiation; thus, the first organisms would have flourished where they were more protected, such as in ocean depths or beneath the surface of the Earth. At this time too, strong volcanic activity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms—the first prokaryotes—were adapted to very high temperatures. Early Earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from the sun. The first organisms were prokaryotes that could withstand these harsh conditions.

## Microbial Mats

Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago. A  **microbial mat** is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes ({'Figure_22_1_1 Figure 22.1.1}) that includes mostly bacteria, but also archaea. Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. The various types of prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix.

The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A  **hydrothermal vent** is a breakage or fissure in the Earth’s surface that releases geothermally heated water. With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source—sunlight—whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.

## Stromatolites

Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth. A  **stromatolite** is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat ({'Figure_22_1_2ab Figure 22.1.2ab}). Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate. Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where stromatolites are still forming. For example, growing stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County, California.

## The Ancient Atmosphere

Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth’s existence, the atmosphere was  **anoxic**, meaning that there was no molecular oxygen. Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen— **anaerobic** organisms—were able to live. Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called  **phototrophs**, and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth. Then,  **cyanobacteria**, also known as blue-green algae, evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later. Cyanobacteria ({'Figure_22_1_3 Figure 22.1.3}) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the development of more efficient O<sub>2</sub>-utilizing catabolic pathways. It also opened up the land to increased colonization, because some O<sub>2</sub> is converted into O<sub>3</sub> (ozone) and ozone effectively absorbs the ultraviolet light that would otherwise cause lethal mutations in DNA. Ultimately, the increase in O<sub>2</sub> concentrations allowed the evolution of other life forms.
