name: Reproduction of Green Algae

Green algae reproduce both asexually, by fragmentation or dispersal of spores, or sexually, by producing gametes that fuse during fertilization. In a single-celled organism such as  *Chlamydomonas*, there is no mitosis after fertilization. In the multicellular  *Ulva*, a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization. Both  *Chlamydomonas*and  *Ulva* produce flagellated gametes.
