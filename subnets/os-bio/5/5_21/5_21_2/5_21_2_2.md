name: Different Hosts and Their Viruses

As youâ€™ve learned, viruses often infect very specific hosts, as well as specific cells within the host. This feature of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on Earth. On the other hand, so many different types of viruses exist on Earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of  *viruses* trying to infect its cells. Even prokaryotes, the smallest and simplest of cells, may be attacked by specific types of viruses. In the following section, we will look at some of the features of viral infection of prokaryotic cells. As we have learned, viruses that infect bacteria are called  *bacteriophages* ({'Figure_21_2_2 Figure 21.2.2}). Archaea have their own similar viruses.
