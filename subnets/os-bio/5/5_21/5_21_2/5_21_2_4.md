name: Plant Viruses

Most plant viruses, like the tobacco mosaic virus, have single-stranded (+) RNA genomes. However, there are also plant viruses in most other virus categories. Unlike bacteriophages, plant viruses do not have active mechanisms for delivering the viral genome across the protective cell wall. For a plant virus to enter a new host plant, some type of mechanical damage must occur. This damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Movement from cell to cell within a plant can be facilitated by viral modification of plasmodesmata (cytoplasmic threads that pass from one plant cell to the next). Additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plantâ€™s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. The transfer of a virus from one plant to another is known as  **horizontal transmission**, whereas the inheritance of a virus from a parent is called  **vertical transmission**.

Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (). One common symptom is  **hyperplasia**, the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as  **galls**. Other viruses induce  **hypoplasia**, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as  **cell necrosis**. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves; black streaks on the stems of the plants; altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits; and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf.

| Symptom | Appears as |
|:-:|:-:|
| Hyperplasia | Galls (tumors) |
| Hypoplasia | Thinned, yellow splotches on leaves |
| Cell necrosis | Dead, blackened stems, leaves, or fruit |
| Abnormal growth patterns | Malformed stems, leaves, or fruit |
| Discoloration | Yellow, red, or black lines, or rings in stems, leaves, or fruit |
    

Plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply. They are responsible for poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. Others viruses may damage plants used in landscaping. Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for landscaping, two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail, but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants. In the ornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant.
