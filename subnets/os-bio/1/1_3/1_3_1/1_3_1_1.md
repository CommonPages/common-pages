name: Dehydration Synthesis

Most macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called  **monomers**. The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as  **polymers**. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is  **dehydration synthesis**, which means “to put together while losing water.”

In a dehydration synthesis reaction ({'Figure_3_1_1 Figure 3.1.1}), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer, releasing a water molecule. At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds. As additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer. Different monomer types can combine in many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules. Even one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of ways to form several different polymers. For example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen, and cellulose.
