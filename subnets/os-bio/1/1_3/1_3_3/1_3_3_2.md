name: Waxes

 **Wax** covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants. Because of the hydrophobic nature of waxes, they prevent water from sticking on the surface ({'Figure_3_3_11 Figure 3.3.11}). Waxes are made up of long fatty acid chains esterified to long-chain alcohols.
