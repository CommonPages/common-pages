name: Types and Functions of Proteins

 **Enzymes**, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.

 **Hormones** are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level. The primary types and functions of proteins are listed in .


****

| Type | Examples | Functions |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Digestive Enzymes | Amylase, lipase, pepsin, trypsin | Help in digestion of food by catabolizing nutrients into monomeric units |
| Transport | Hemoglobin, albumin | Carry substances in the blood or lymph throughout the body |
| Structural | Actin, tubulin, keratin | Construct different structures, like the cytoskeleton |
| Hormones | Insulin, thyroxine | Coordinate the activity of different body systems |
| Defense | Immunoglobulins | Protect the body from foreign pathogens |
| Contractile | Actin, myosin | Effect muscle contraction |
| Storage | Legume storage proteins, egg white (albumin) | Provide nourishment in early development of the embryo and the seedling |
    

Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as  **denaturation**. All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids.
