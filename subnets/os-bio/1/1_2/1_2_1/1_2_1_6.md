name: Electron Orbitals

Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model does not accurately reflect how electrons spatially distribute themselves around the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but we find them in  **electron orbitals**. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics, which scientists call wave functions, can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. Scientists call the area where an electron is most likely to be found its orbital.

Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom’s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly an electron's location, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. The letter s, *p*, *d*, and  *f* designate the subshells. The  *s* subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single  *s* orbital, which can hold two electrons. Principal shell 2n has one  *s* and one  *p* subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The  *p* subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as {'Figure_2_1_7 Figure 2.1.7} illustrates. Subshells  *d* and  *f* have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. We do not show these in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has  *s*,  *p*, and  *d* subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has  *s*,  *p*,  *d* and  *f* orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals in the energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, we can determine the electron structure by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.

The closest orbital to the nucleus, the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the Bohr model's innermost electron shell. Scientists call it the 1 *s* orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus. The 1 *s* orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital fills. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it occupies only one spot within the 1 *s* orbital. We designate this as 1 *s*<sup>1</sup>, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1 *s* orbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1 *s* orbital with its two electrons. We designate this as 1 *s*<sup>2</sup>, referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1 *s* orbital. On the periodic table {'Figure_2_1_4 Figure 2.1.4}, hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period). This is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1 *s* orbital. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1 *s* and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.

The second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another spherical  *s* orbital and three “dumbbell” shaped  *p* orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as {'Figure_2_1_7 Figure 2.1.7} shows. After the 1 *s* orbital fills, the second electron shell fills, first filling its 2 *s* orbital and then its three  *p* orbitals. When filling the  *p* orbitals, each takes a single electron. Once each  *p* orbital has an electron, it may add a second. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells. Two electrons fill the 1 *s* orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2 *s* orbital. Its  **electron configuration** is 1 *s*<sup>2</sup>2 *s*<sup>1</sup>. Neon (Ne), alternatively, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1 *s* orbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2 *s* and three  *p* orbitals). Thus it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, comprising the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of an atom's electron configuration because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and special orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy.
