name: Leaf Form

Leaves may be simple or compound (). In a  **simple leaf**, the blade is either completely undivided—as in the banana leaf—or it has lobes, but the separation does not reach the midrib, as in the maple leaf. In a  **compound leaf**, the leaf blade is completely divided, forming leaflets, as in the locust tree. Each leaflet may have its own stalk, but is attached to the rachis. A  **palmately compound leaf** resembles the palm of a hand, with leaflets radiating outwards from one point Examples include the leaves of poison ivy, the buckeye tree, or the familiar houseplant  *Schefflera* sp. (common name “umbrella plant”).  **Pinnately compound leaves** take their name from their feather-like appearance; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib, as in rose leaves ( *Rosa* sp.), or the leaves of hickory, pecan, ash, or walnut trees.
