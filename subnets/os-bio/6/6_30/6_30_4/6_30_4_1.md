name: Structure of a Typical Leaf

Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the  **lamina**, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a  **petiole**. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called  **sessile** leaves. Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as  **stipules**. Most leaves have a midrib, which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is called the margin.  shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.

Within each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the  **venation** pattern. Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation (). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, the  *Ginkgo biloba*, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork.
