/ Nucleus
/// The nucleus is the center of an atom. It is made up of nucleons called (protons and neutrons) and is surrounded by the electron cloud.

    Although, it is only a very small part of the atom (10,000 times smaller), virtually all the mass (99.9%) of an atom resides in its nucleus. The protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus are approximately the same mass (the proton is slightly less) and have the same angular momentum, or spin.
    Neutrons have no charge and protons are positively charged. Because the nucleus is only made up of protons and neutrons it is positively charged. Things that have the same charge repel each other: this repulsion is part of what is called electromagnetic force. Since positively charged protons would push away from each other, the nucleus wouldn't be held together. The nucleus is actually held together by another force known as the strong nuclear force. This force between the protons and neutrons overcomes the repulsive electromagnetic force that would otherwise push the protons apart.
    Some atomic nuclei are unstable because the binding force varies for different atoms based on the size of the nucleus. These atoms will then decay into other elements, such as carbon-14 decaying into nitrogen-14.
