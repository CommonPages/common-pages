    Human physiology is the scientific study of chemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the way in which they work together to support the functions of life.
    Much of the physiology centers on the body's tendency towards <b>{homeostasis Homeostasis}</b>.
    <h2> Levels of Study </h2>
    Human physiology is broken into four levels of increasing physiological complexity.
    <b>{molecularlevel 1. Molecular Level}</b>-  The most basic level is the molecular level, which includes all chemical substances that are necessary for cells to function.
    <b>2. Tissue Level</b> - At the tissue level, study expands to examine function of the basic types of tissue, including epithelial, muscle, nervous, and connective tissues.
    <b>{organlevel 3. Organ Level}</b> - The third level of study is the organ level. An organ consists of two or more tissues that perform a certain function. Typical organs studied include heart, liver, lungs, and stomach.
    <b>4. System Level </b> - The fourth level of study is the system level, which studies the functions of the major systems of the human body: Digestive, Nervous, Endocrine, Respiratory, Circulatory, Urinary and Reproductive



  >>>
    Human physiology is closely related to anatomy, in that anatomy is the study of form, physiology is the study of function, and there is an intrinsic link between form and function. For example, at the cellular level, consider a protein, a complex macromolecule made up of a sequence of amino acids. The actual shape (form) is what allows it to do its job within the body. In fact, its shape is everything! This is because it serves a purpose that solely depends on its shape.

    <h2>{functions Functions of Human Life }</h2>
    The different organ system each have different functions and therefore unique role to perfom in physiology. There are many functions, one we might consider definative of human life are :- Organization, Metabolism, Responsiveness, Movement, Development, Reproduction

    <h2>{Requirements Requirements of Human life}</h2>
    Humans have been adapting to life on Earth for at least the past 200,000 years. Earth and its atmosphere have provided us with air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, but these are not the only requirements for survival. Although you may rarely think about it, you also cannot live outside of a certain range of temperature and pressure that the surface of our planet and its atmosphere provides.
